# Lewis and Clark Schema

## LC Specific Fields

* **lc_previous_s** The previous journal entry. This comes straight from the TEI.
* **lc_next_s** The next journal entry. This comes straight from the TEI.
* **lc_filename_s** The filename, if it is different from the ID. 
* **lc_native_nation_ss** This is analogous to "People" and "Places" for the index. From the tei: `<name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">`
* **lc_year_s** (maybe) Might use for calendar view
* **lc_year_month_s** (maybe)  Might use for calendar view
* **lc_index_combined_ss** Combined field to build the index
* **lc_searchtype_s** Two types: all and journalfile. The journalfile fields are the combined files with all entries.
* **lc_city_ss** For faceting by city
* **lc_state_ss** For faceting by state
* **lc_county_ss** For faceting by county
* **lc_timeline_place_s** placement in timeline, will be a number between 1 - 1100


### Also note: 

* **people** This is not taken from the header, instead it is from name tags: `<name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">`
* **places** This is not taken from the header, instead it is from name tags: `<name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">`

## Resource Identification:

### id
* **id**
* **slug** (I have been using this in some contexts to indicate where the files are found, i.e. cody/xml/tei/. Should include the shorthand version of the project, i.e. “cody” at the least)
* **project** (the full CDRH name of the resource, e.g. “The William F. Cody Archive”)
* **uri** (full URI of resource)
* **uriXML** (full URL to XML of data, when available)
* **uriHTML** (full URL to HTML snippit of data)
* **dataType** (the format the data was originally stored in at CDRH. current options: tei, dublin_core, vra_core, csv)
* **fig_location** Used when the figures are kept in a place other than the normal place CDRH will store images. 
* **image_id** Used when an image id does not match the file id. This is NOT multivalued, and is meant to only link to one image (for instance, the one which will be used as the thumbnail)

### Dublin Core Metadata Elements. 

I’ve included a couple of extra elements here as they make sense to support the DC elements. DC Elements described here: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/

* **title**
* **titleSort** (a,an,the removed/moved to the end)
* **creator** (a singular field for the creator, used for sorting. If there are multiple creators, they will be alphabetized  i.e. “Boggs, Jeremy; Earhart, Amy; Graham, Wayne”
* **creators** (multivalued field containing the names from above - <field>Boggs, Jeremy</field>, <field>Earhart, Amy</field>, <field>Graham, Wayne</field>)
* **subject** (generally won’t be used because it’s covered by topics below, but may use this for controlled vocab subject)
* **subjects** (multivalued version of above)
* **description** (a short description of the resource, often what will be shown in search results/aggregation pages)
* **publisher** (generally for books. The CDRH is the known publisher of the electronic versions, and we may want to find a way to distinguish that from the original publisher)
* **contributor** (all contributors collapsed into one field like creator above. Pulled from TEI resp statements and the like)
* **contributors** (multivalued)
* **date** (date using the solr date value)
* **dateDisplay** (however we want the date to display, either pulled from the TEI or normalized from the @when)
* **type** (From Dublin core, usually will be Image, Text, Sound or something like this. Often a duplicate of “subCategory” field)
* **format** (The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource.)
* **medium** (added because a few projects seem to use it)
* **extent** (size or time span)
* **language**
* **relation** (A related resource that is substantially the same as the described resource, but in another format.)
* **coverage** (The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.) (Included for completeness, but probably covered in most cases by other fields)
* **source** (A related resource from which the described resource is derived) - in many cases, this may be the newspaper, publication, or book the resource is from.
* **rightsHolder** (A person or organization owning or managing rights over the resource.) - often this is where the CDRH got the object
* **rights** (any information about the rights)
* **rightsURI** (URI for above, will usually be linked to the “rights holder” for display purposes)

### Other elements: 

* **principalInvestigator** (in TEI header)
* **principalInvestigators** (multivalued)
* **place** (solr lat/long type) (for now, I am assuming each document has only one place. we may need to reevaluate in the future)
* **placeName** (name for the place above, or may be used without the lat/long)
* **recipient** (a singular field for the recipient(s), used for sorting. If there are multiple recipients, they will be alphabetized  i.e. “Boggs, Jeremy; Earhart, Amy; Graham, Wayne”
* **recipients** (multivalued field containing the names from above - <field>Boggs, Jeremy</field>, <field>Earhart, Amy</field>, <field>Graham, Wayne</field>)
* **sender** (a singular field for the sender(s), used for sorting. If there are multiple recipients, they will be alphabetized  i.e. “Boggs, Jeremy; Earhart, Amy; Graham, Wayne”
* **sender** (multivalued field containing the names from above - <field>Boggs, Jeremy</field>, <field>Earhart, Amy</field>, <field>Graham, Wayne</field>)

### CDRH specific categorization (all pulled directly from the profileDesc)

* **category**
* **subCategory**
* **topics** (multivalued)
* **keywords** (multivalued)
* **people** (multivalued)
* **places** (multivalued)
* **works** (multivalued)

### Generic Text field: (much of the above is copied into this for text searching)

* **text**

## Dynamic Fields

Some projects may require fields which do not yet exist. Below are the field suffixes to use in this case. See [example schema](solr_example_files/api_projectName_test/conf/schema.xml) for implementation.

    <dynamicField name="*_i"  type="int"    indexed="true"  stored="true"/>
    <dynamicField name="*_is" type="int"    indexed="true"  stored="true"  multiValued="true"/>
    <dynamicField name="*_s"  type="string"  indexed="true"  stored="true" />
    <dynamicField name="*_ss" type="string"  indexed="true"  stored="true" multiValued="true"/>
