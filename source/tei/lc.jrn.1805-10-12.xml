                  <hi rend="italic">Saturday 12th.</hi>    We had a fine morning and proceeded on early. Two of the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flathead</name> chiefs remained on board with us, and two of their men went with the stranger<ref target="n23101207" n="7"/> in a small canoe, and acted as pilots or guides. We saw some ducks and a few geese, but did not kill any of them. There is no four-footed game of any kind near this part of the river, that we could discover; 
and we saw no birds of any kind, but a few hawks, eagles and crows. At noon we halted, cooked and eat some fish and then proceeded on. The country and river this day is much the same in appearance as what we passed yesterday. A little before sunset we came to a bad rapid, which we did not wish to pass at night, so we encamped above on the north side, having made 30 miles.</p>
               <p>
Some of the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flathead</name> nation<ref target="n23101208" n="8"/> of Indians live all along the river this far down. There are not more than 4 lodges in a place or village, and these small 
camps or villages are 8 or 10 miles apart: at each camp there are 5 or 6 small canoes. Their summer lodges are made of willows and flags, and their winter lodges of split pine, almost like rails, which they bring down on rafts to this part of the river where there is no timber.

Saturday October 12th    We had a clear pleasant morning, &amp; we set out early &amp; proceeded on our Voyage down the River.    The Country has the same appearance as it had Yesterday.    we passed a number of old fishing 
Camps, lying along the Shores on both sides of the River, and found the current of the River run very swift in many places.    About 12 o'Clock A. M. we halted to dine on the South side of the River where we could scarcely find wood enough to Cook our provisions.    <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> took at this place a 
Meridian Observation and found this place to lay in Latitude 46° 29' 21 7/10S. North.    We continued our Voyage at 2 o'Clock P. M. &amp; passed several more fishing Camps, lying on both sides of the River.    The wind rose &amp; blew hard from the West.    We also passed high clifts of Rocks &amp; high Priaries, both lying on each side of the River, &amp; they had a handsome appearance.    The Country has a pleasant appearance this day, but no kind of timber is to be seen.    We came about 35 Miles this day, &amp; encamped on the North side of the River, at the head of a bad Rockey rapid, where we expect to meet with difficulty in passing it.—    We got the Indians Canoe &amp; our smallest Canoe over this rapid this evening.    We expect that we have passed the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">flatt head Nation</name>, which were very numerous.    Our Guides who are Indians inform us, that in 2 days more sailing, that we shall come to another Nation of Indians, who reside near a fork of the River <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name> &amp; that this fork lies on the South side of the said River.—
