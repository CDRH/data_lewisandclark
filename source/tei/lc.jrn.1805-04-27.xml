This morning I walked through the point formed by the junction of the rivers; the woodland extends about a mile, when the rivers approach each other within less than half a mile; here a beatifull level low plain commences and extends up both rivers for many miles, widening as the rivers recede from each other, and extending back half a mile to a plain about 12 feet higher than itself; the low plain appears to be a few inches higher than high water mark and of course will not be liable to be overflown; tho' where it joins the high plain a part of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> when at it's greatest hight, passes through a channel of 60 or 70 yards wide and falls into the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name>.    on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> about 2½ miles from the entrance of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name>, and between this high and low plain, a small lake is situated about 200 yards wide extending along the edge of the high plain parallel with the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> about one mile.    on the point of the high plain at the lower extremity of this lake I think would be the most eligible site for an establishment.<ref target="n11042701" n="1"/>    between this low plain and the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone river</name> there is an extensive body of timbered land extending up the river for many miles.    this site recommended is about 400 yards distant from the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and about double that distance from the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">river yellowstone</name>; from it the high plain, rising very gradually, extends back about three miles to the hills, and continues with the same width between these hills and the timbered land on the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name>, up that stream, for seven or eight miles; and is one of the hadsomest plains I ever beheld.    on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> side the hills sircumscribe it's width, &amp; at the distance of three miles up that river from this site, it is not more than 400 yards wide. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> thinks that the lower extremity of the low plane would be most eligible for this establishment; it is true that it is much nearer both rivers, and might answer very well, but I think it reather too low to venture a permanent establishment, particularly if built of brick or other durable materials, at any considerable expence; for so capricious, and versatile are these rivers, that it is difficult to say how long it will be, untill they direct the force of their currents against this narrow part of the low plain, which when they do, must shortly yeald to their influence; in such case a few years only would be necessary, for the annihilation of the plain, and with it the fortification.—    I continued my walk on shore; at 11 A. M. the wind became very hard from N. W. insomuch that the perogues and canoes were unable either to proceede or pass the river to me; I was under the necessity therefore of shooting a goose and cooking it for my dinner.    the wind abated about 4 P. M. and the party proceeded tho' I could not conveniently join them untill night.    altho' game is very abundant and gentle, we only kill as much as is necessary for food. I believe that two good hunters could conveniently supply a regiment with provisions.    for several days past we have observed a great number of buffaloe lying dead on the shore, some of them entire and others partly devoured by the wolves and bear.    those anamals either drowned during the winter in attempting to pass the river on the ice during the winter or by swiming acrss at present to bluff banks which they are unable to ascend, and feeling themselves too weak to return remain and perish for the want of food; in this situation we met with several little parties of them.—    beaver are very abundant, the party kill several of them every day.    The Eagles, Magpies, and gees have their nests in trees adjacent to each other; the magpye particularly appears fond of building near the Eagle, as we scarcely see an Eagle's nest unaccompanyed with two or three Magpies nests within a short distance.—    The bald Eagle are more abundant here than I ever observed them in any part of the country.</p>

M. to dine in a bottom, cover'd with Cotton wood Trees, lying on the North side of the River, shortly after the Wind blew so hard a head, from the Westward that we were delayed from starting till 4 o'Clock P. M.    we then got underway, and in the Evening, we encamped on the South side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">River Mesouri</name>, having had a strong current against us, we came only 8 Miles this day.—
