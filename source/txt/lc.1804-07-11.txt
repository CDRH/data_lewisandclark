Biddle placed this notation at the top of this sheet of the Field Notes (document 30), above the July 11 entry: "July 9 to 13th."Probably later Little Tarkio creek, in Holt County, Missouri. The routes of both Big and Little Tarkio creeks through the bottom to the Missouri seem to have shifted frequently. MRC maps 18, 19.The Big Nemaha River, whose Oto Indian name, nį́mąha, signifies "miry water," enters the Missouri in Richardson County, Nebraska, just above the Nebraska-Kansas line. The camp, opposite the river mouth on an island, may have been in present Holt County, Missouri. The island itself (Lewis's "Newfound" of July 11 "New" of the next day) appears unnamed on Nicollet's map and is missing on later maps. Fitzpatrick, 105; Nicollet (MMR), 377; MRC map 19.Biddle apparently crossed out "Ne Ma how" to substitute his own word.The small willows with narrow and broad leaves are probably Salix exigua Nutt. ssp. interior (Rowlee) Cronq., sandbar, or coyote, willow, and S. amygdaloides Anderss, peach-leaved willow, respectively, although seedlings of the larger willow tree S. nigra Marsh., black willow, could also be found on the sandbars described.
