Its temperature readings are consistently eight degrees above those in Clark's Codex C. No observations were tabulated by either captain after May 14 until September 1804, or at least no such tables have been found.Both captains' remarks for the month of May are substantially the same; here I have followed Lewis's Weather Diary, noting substantive differences. Although tabled observations ceased after May 14, both men continued intermittent remarks on the weather and natural phenomena in the Weather Diary and Codex C weather tables into July. Those are found with the appropriate months.The first part of this remark, as far as the note, is Lewis's, in his Weather Diary; the latter part is Clark's, in Codex C.Clark wrote remarks for May 16, 20, and 21 in his Codex C weather table, then later crossed them out. There are no remarks for those dates in Lewis's Weather Diary.Fragaria virginiana var. illinoensis (Prince) Gray, wild strawberry. Steyermark, 824.Amelanchier arborea (Michx.)
