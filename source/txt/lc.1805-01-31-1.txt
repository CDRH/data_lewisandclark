their amusement in the lodge of the Black Cat—January3rdthe Snow was not considerable    the ground is now covered
9 inches deep—6that 12 oC. today two Luminous spots appeared on either
side of the sun extreemly bright8ththe snow is now ten inches deep.12thsingular appearance of three distinct Halo or luminus rings
about the moon appeared this evening at half after 9 P. M.
and continued one hour.    the moon formed the center
of the middle ring, the other two which lay N & S. of the
moon & had each of them a limb passing through the Moons
Center and projecting N & S a simidiameter beyond the
middle ring to which last they were equal in dimentions,
each ring appearing to subtend an angle of 15 degrees of a
great circle15than eclips of the moon total last night, visible here but par-
tially obscured by the clouds.[18]at Sun rise 12° below 019thIce now 3 feet thick on the most rapid part of the river—[22]mist the afternon observation.23rdthe snow feel about 4 inches deep last night and continues
to snow25thit frequently happens that the ☉ rises fair and in about 15
or 20 minutes it becomes suddonly <cloudy> turbid, as if the
had some chimical effect on the atmosphere.—31stthe Snow feel 2 Inches last night.This weather table follows Lewis's in his Weather Diary; some discrepancies with those of Clark in Codex C and Voorhis No. 4 are noted.This "r" is found in Clark Voorhis No. 4.In Codex C Clark gives this temperature as "28 b."Clark has a blank here in Codex C.Here Clark has a blank in Codex C.Clark has "16 b" in Codex C.In Codex C Clark has "20 b."Clark has a blank here in Codex C.Clark has a blank here in Codex C.From the fifteenth through the rest of the month Lewis has reversed his "Weather" and "Wind at 4 P. M." columns; Clark follows this in Voorhis No. 4 but not in Codex C. The error has been corrected here to avoid confusion.In Voorhis No. 4 Clark gives this as "20 b."In Codex C Clark gives this as "28 a."Clark has "½" in Codex C but agrees with Lewis in Voorhis No. 4.The "r" is only in Clark's Voorhis No. 4.The remarks follow Lewis's in the Weather Diary, noting variations in Clark's Codex C. The dates are Clark's. Clark's remarks in Voorhis No. 4 are few and very brief.Clark has no remarks for January 2.Clark adds "accumolateing by frosts" in Codex C.Clark's brief remarks of this phenomenon in Voorhis No. 4 appear to be intended for either the tenth or the eleventh. One might interpret Lewis's remark as placed under the thirteenth, but Clark's Codex C version is clearly dated the twelfth. The captains are actually seeing an atmospheric event caused by the refraction of light by ice crystals. Neiburger, Edinger, & Bonner, 426.Clark has no remarks for this date.Clark has no remarks for this date.
