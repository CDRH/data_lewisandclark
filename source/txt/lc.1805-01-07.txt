Clark was receiving information about the Yellowstone, or Roche Jaune, River. The Canadian trader Ménard (see above, October 25, 1804) claimed to have been on the river some time before 1795 and gave a description of it to Jean Baptiste Truteau. In any case, the French traders of St. Louis had received enough information from Indians before Lewis and Clark's time to have given it a name, perhaps derived from the yellow rocks in the river's upper canyon in present Yellowstone National Park. The information given by Big White was incorporated into "Big White's map," (Atlas maps 31a and 31b) and Clark's 1805 map of the West (Atlas maps 32a, 32b, and 32c). The Great Falls of the Missouri, as the Indians told him, were roughly due west of the Mandan villages.
