There is no entry for November 5 in the Field Notes.As with some other references to an unnamed interpreter during the winter at Fort Mandan, it is not clear whether the man referred to is Jusseaume or Charbonneau.The Assinniboines called themselves Nak'ota and spoke a dialect of the Sioux language. Although closely related, the two groups maintained distinct identities from their first mention by whites in 1640. By the time of Lewis and Clark the Assinniboines, like the Sioux, were nomadic buffalo hunters, ranging north of the Missouri on both sides of the present United States–Canadian border, in northeastern Montana, northwest North Dakota, and southern Saskatchewan. Their linguistic relationship with the Sioux did not preclude hostilities between the two. Hodge, 1:102–5; Denig, 63–98; Lowie(TA); Kennedy; Coues (NLEH), 2:516–23.A latrine.
