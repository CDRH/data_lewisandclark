A few random scribblings (some illegible) are not printed here. Clark is the author where not specified otherwise.Here Clark summarizes a number of disciplinary problems during the winter at Camp Dubois. Apparently some men were expelled and allowed to return on a promise to do better. S. was probably John Shields, because Lewis expresses particular shock at his conduct in the Detachment Order of March 3, and Shields was one of those tried by court-martial on March 29. F. might be Reubin or Joseph Field. Charles Floyd is probably not meant, since he was made a sergeant soon after. Colter may have been the one who loaded his gun, since he was one of those tried on March 29. R. F is probably Reubin Field, since Frazer is mentioned below as in error wishing to return.This list must be another attempt to determine the composition of the expedition party. Howard's name probably goes at the end of the list, since the numbers to either side of his name coordinate with those below and since Clark had come to the bottom of the page. The numbers at either side of some names may have relevance beyond a simple count, but the meaning is not now known. Tick marks (not printed) may have been a means of evaluation, but this is conjecture.In this list of Indian tribes "republican" refers to the Republican, or Kitkahahki, division of the Pawnees; "Loup" to the Loup, or Skiri, division of that tribe. "Chayon," may be Cheyenne, but being joined with "Loup," it must refer to the Chawi, or Grand, division of the Pawnees. The numbers by the names may refer to the number of villages or divisions of each, based on information from traders or Indians. Hodge, 1:238; Parks.Following these numbers is a drawing of a "Perogue of 8 Tuns" (fig. 8), the so-called white pirogue. This is the only contemporary illustration of one of the two boats taken as far as the Great Falls of the Missouri River. It may have been drawn as an aid in determining how to store goods.The names and perhaps the figures seem to represent further attempts by Clark to determine how many men should compose the expedition and to assign them to various boats. Part of this material runs into the paragraph beginning "No man is to absent himself. . . ."This is probably a first draft for a detachment order and is similar to the order of February 20.Unidentified symbols drawn to the right or left of some of these names are here represented as a check mark.The word "Soap" is placed near this list of supplies and perhaps is a part of it.
