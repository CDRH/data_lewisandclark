Verry foggy this morning. Thermometer 63° Ferrenheit, immersed the Thermometer in the river, and the murcury arose immediately to 75° or summer heat so that there is 12° difference is sufficient to shew the vapor which arrises from the water; the fogg this prodused is impenetrably thick at this moment; we were in consequence obliged to ly by untill 9 this morning    Mr. Gui Briant arrived with two boats loaded with firrs, he informs me that if I can reach, and get over the George-town barr 24 miles I can get on; this is some consolation.    we set out at 9 this morning and passed a riffle just below us called Atkins's    got over with tolerable ease passed the mouth of big bever creek and came to ancor off Mackintosh being 2½ miles—   discharge one of my hands.—    passed the riffle below Mackintosh.—    about three miles from this we stuck on another riffle the worst I think we have yet passed  were obliged to unload and drag over with horses.—    staid all night having made only six miles.—Guy Bryan, a wealthy merchant of Philadelphia, supplied goods to fur traders at Kaskaskia, Illinois.
