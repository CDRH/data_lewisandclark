the Mandanes with a party of men.Lewis's weather table comes from his Weather Diary; Clark's table is in Codex C. Lewis is followed here, with some variations by Clark being noted.Lewis here resumes noting the fall and rise of the river, which was only possible while they remained in one place during the day.From this point through the rest of the month and into December Lewis has transposed his "Weather" and "Wind at ☉ rise" columns, putting the information in the wrong place. The information has been rearranged to avoid confusion.The remarks are from Lewis Weather Diary, with substantial variations in Clark's Codex C noted. The dates are Clark's, since he wrote his remarks separately and Lewis placed his beside his weather table. Someone has crossed out Clark's remarks, except those for the first, seventh, eighth, ninth, and thirteenth.Clark inserts "to a proper place to camp" here.Here Clark has "the Boat droped down."Here Clark adds "& child."Clark adds "wind hard this evening."Clark has no remarks for this date.This must be Paul Primeau. It is not clear if the two French boys were listed as engagés, were with the expedition as unlisted choreboys, or were encountered at the Mandan villages. Primeau and La Jeunesse were probably the two hands discharged on November 5.Probably cedar waxwings, Bombycilla cedromm [AOU, 619]. Lewis calls them "cherry or cedar birds" in his weather remarks for April 6, 1805, giving a brief description. The species was not named until 1807. Burroughs, 254–55.Clark's remark ends here.Clark notes that Lewis set out, and has "Big Bellies" instead of "grosventres."From here Clark has "& passed a Second night," apparently writing in the first person although he is clearly describing Lewis's activities.Clark again writes as if in the first person, although describing Lewis's activities. From here Clark writes, "a Clerk of the N W Company."From here Clark, writing of himself in the third person, says "to assit them in defenc of the Sioux who had killed one man wounded 2 & taken maney horses. returned in the evening on the ice."
