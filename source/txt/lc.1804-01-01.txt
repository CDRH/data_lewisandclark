Perhaps Joseph, Joshua or Josiah Vaughn, who all lived near the camp. Madison, 72, 82–83.Nelumbo lutea (Willd.) Pers. American lotus, yellow nelumbo, yellow lotus, water chinquapin, pond-nuts, is an aquatic plant that Lewis describes more elaborately in an undated entry. "Pokers hake" may be Clark's attempt at the Kickapoo name, which Lewis wrote as Po-kish'-a-co-mah. "Volies" is the French term for the plant, graine de volaille. It is commonly found in oxbow lakes along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Fernald, 641; Steyermark, 668. Its importance to Indians is described by Gilmore, 27, in terms very similar to Lewis's.The lack of punctuation makes it uncertain whether "Lisbet" was the blacksmith. The word itself is unclear. He might be the "Thos. Lisbet Blacksmith" on document 2 of the Field Notes (placed under November 26, 1803, entry). Nothing is known of this person. Osgood read it as "Leebice" (which it may well be) and related that to François Labiche, a member of the party. Osgood (FN), 11 n. 3.Probably Patrick Heneberry, an early settler in this part of Illinois, and at the time an employee of William Morrison. Jackson (LLC), 1:144–45 n. 4.If this word is read as "Ossini" or something similar, it may be a reference to the Assiniboine River of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, a tributary of the Red River of the North. There were British fur-trading posts on both rivers, from which traders sometimes traveled to the Mandan villages.
