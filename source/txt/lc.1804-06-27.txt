There are no separate entries for June 27 and 28 in the Field Notes. The entries for the two days in Codex A are given here.According to Ordway, one of the hunters, Cruzatte, killed a deer.Lewis's observation from Codex O.Probably the larger of the two pirogues, the red pirogue.This sentence is intended to explain that the Kaw, or Kansa, Indians took their name 
from the river, although the reverse is probably the case.
