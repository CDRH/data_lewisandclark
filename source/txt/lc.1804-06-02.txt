June 2nd—    Took the Dirts. [directions] of Son & moon &c &c.    I measured the Osage & Missouris at this place    made ther width as follows, the Missoure 875 yd. wide    The Osage R397 yds. wide, the distance between the 2 rivers 80 poles up is 40 ps. [poles?]    Took equal altitudes & Mredian altitude also—and made them [blank]    I assended the hill in the point 80 ps. from the pt. found it about 100 foot high, on the top is 2 graves, or mouns, a Delightfull prospect from this hill which Comds. both riversDrewyer & Shields came to the opposit Side to day at SunSet    we sent across & brought them over, they had been absent 7 Days    Swam many creeks, much worsted. They informed us that the Countrey on both Sides of muddy river's to the hill called by the french [blank]    3 ms. below this place, a Small Praries below the hill, 4 Deer Killed to day    I assend a hill &. after measuring the river &c. &c. &c.Clark
June 2nd Satturday    Cap Lewis Took the Time & Distance of ☉s & moons nearest limbs, the Sun East—    and Meridean altitude of Suns U. L. with Octant, back observation gave for altitude 37° 28' 00".
Error of Octant 2° 00' 00" +.    made Several other observations—    I made an angle for the Wedth of the two rivers. The Missourie from the Point to the N. Side is 875 yards wide    the Osage River from the point to the S. E Side is 397 <337> yards wide, the destance between the two rivers at the pt. of high Land (100 foot above the bottom) and 80 poles up the Missouries from the point is 40 poles, on the top of this high land <of> under which is a limestone rock two Mouns or graves are raised—    <I took Meridine altitude of the Suns>    from this pt. which Comds [NB: commands] both rivers I had a delightfull prospect of the Missouries up & down, also the Osage R. up.    George Drewyer & John Shields who we had Sent with the horses by Land on the N Side joined us this evening much worsted, they being absent Seven Days depending on their gun, the greater part of the time rain, they were obliged to raft or Swim many Creeks, those men gave a flattering account of the Countrey Commencing below the first hill on the N Side and extendg Parrelal with the river for 30 or 40 Ms. The Two Muddey river passing Thro: & som fine Springs & Streams    our hunters kill Several Deer to day, Some Small licks on the S E of the Osage River.LewisSaturday, June 2ed

Saturday 2nd June 1804.    our officers lay by this day for observations.    4 men went out a hunting.    about 12oC. they came in had killed 4 deer.    we now lay at the Grand osage River which comes in on the South Side which is a handsome River 397 yards wide    the Missourie is at this place 875 yards wide.    we fell Some trees in the point to open a place for observations
Saturday June 2nd    This day we lay by to get an Observation.    four of our Men went a hunting; about 12oClock they returned, and had killed 4 deer, we still now lay at the Grand Osage River; which comes in on the South side of the Mesouri, it is a handsome River 397 Yards wide and the Mesouri River at this place is 875 Yards wide
We had a number of hands employed in felling Trees at the point of the Grand Osage River, to open a place in order to take an observation.

Beside the date are these figures in column: 7 and 6. Written under the entry at right angles are the words "Carsuex-Raft."Five mounds are known on the high point of land north of modern Osage City, in two groups: one of three mounds, and one of two, the latter on the extreme eastern part of the point. Clark undoubtedly saw the group of two. Many prehistoric, Middle to Late Woodland earthen burial mounds dating to the first millennium A.D. and a little later are found along the Missouri River bluffs in central and western Missouri.
