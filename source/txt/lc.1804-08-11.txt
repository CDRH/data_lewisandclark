GassSaturday 11th.    A storm came on at three o'clock this morning and continued till nine, notwithstanding which, we kept under way till ten, when we came to a high bluff, where an Indian chief had been buried, and placed a flag upon a pole, which had been set up at his grave. His name was Blackbird, king of the Mahas; an absolute monarch while living, and the Indians suppose can exercise the power of one though dead. We encamped in latitude 42d 1m 3s 3, as ascertained by observation.

Saturday August 11th    At 3 o'Clock this morning we had a rain, which was very heavy, which was immediately succeeded with a smart breeze from the South.    at 6 oClock we set sail, and passed a bluff where the Black bird, the late king of the Mahaws was buried about 4 Years before, the officers landed a small distance above the bluff, and took with them a White Flag, and ascended the Hill which was 300 feet higher than the surface of the water, and placed the flag which they had fix'd on a long pole stuck in the grave.    At 10 oClock A. M the officers embarked again    We proceeded on & in the Evening encamped on the North side of the River.    The distance we sail'd this day being 18 Miles—


Blackbird (Wazhin' gaçabe) was a notorious character along the Missouri, noted for his friendship with white traders and his strong rule over his own people. Under his leadership the Omahas rose to prominence on the eastern plains. Reports of his war deeds are mixed, but he seems to have had great authority because of his sorcery, especially in the deaths of the enemies who were likely killed by his use of poisons obtained from traders. Legend has it that he was buried seated on the back of his horse, on the hilltop where he used to watch for the coming of his friends the traders. Nasatir (BLC), 1:282–94; Appleman (LC), 334–35; Thwaites (EWT), 14:317–20, 22:277; Fletcher & La Flesche, 1:82–83, 173; Atlas map 15; MRC map 26; MRR map 72.Clark used an asterisk as a reference to the remainder of the daily narrative, which followed the courses and distances and astronomical observations. The material is brought together for ease of reading.The Dakota sandstone, basal Cretaceous, is exposed along streams and the Missouri River bluffs.Blackbird Creek in Thurston County, Nebraska, southeast of present Macy. The Omaha name may be wakon'dagi pezhi te; Robert L. Rankin (personal communication) gives it as wakką́da ppéži or "bad spirit." Fletcher & La Flesche, 1:91; Atlas map 15; MRC map 26; MRR map 73.The extreme bend of the Missouri River, at whose eastern extremity they camped, has long since been cut off. Indeed, pencil marks on Atlas map 15, probably by Prince Maximilian, indicate that it was already cut off when he passed that way in 1833. The campsite, therefore, is some miles east of the present course of the river, in Monona County, Iowa, in the vicinity of present Badger Lake, apparently the river's old course. MRC map 26; MRR map 73.None of the enlisted journal-keepers indicate clearly that they were with this party, although Gass says that "we" raised the flag on the hill.These words were squeezed in at the bottom of the page in Codex A.Clark changes the designations from "crains" to "Herrons" between entries. It is the great blue heron, first mentioned in weather remarks for February 13, 1804. Swenk, 120. This is probably the correct course for the day. Clark's last entry in the Field Notes for August 11 probably belongs with his August 12 entry (as carried there) and the total should be 17.Lewis's observation from Codex O.Blackbird, chief of the Omahas, was buried on Blackbird Hill, Thurston County, Nebraska.These words are underscored in red ink.These words are underscored in red ink.Blackbird Creek, Thurston County, southeast of Macy. Floyd repeats "the Grait Sperit is Bad" in the left-hand margin.These words are underscored in red ink.Blackbird Hill, Thurston County, Nebraska, near Macy. Gass says more about the Omaha Indian Chief Blackbird himself than Clark, showing that the Blackbird legend was already well developed a few years after the chief's death.Again written over "South."
