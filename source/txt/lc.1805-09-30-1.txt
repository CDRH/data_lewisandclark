hot dayLewis's weather data are in Codex Fe and Codex P; Clark's are in Codex I. This table followed Codex Fe, with discrepancies noted. There is no record of river rise or fall.Lewis in Codex P and Clark in Codex I have only "c a r."Lewis in Codex P and Clark in Codex I have only "c a s."Lewis in Codex P has only "f."Lewis in Codex P and Clark in Codex I have only "f."Lewis (Codices Fe and P) and Clark (Codex I) have a number of marginal remarks for this month, many of which do not refer to the weather. Lewis is missing remarks for a number of days; Clark's are substituted for the following: September 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 30.Clark in Codex I adds, "in the Rock mountains." This was their last thermometer and there were, of course, no recorded temperatures for the remainder of the expedition.These Flatheads were probably Nez Perces.Clark adds, "Snowed rained & hailed to day."Clark adds, "to boil our Colt."Clark's remark reads, "the Snow fell on the old Snow 4 inches deep last night."There are numerous possibilities for both the wild rose (Rosa) and raspberries (Rubus) in the area. Possibilities for the rose include Rosa nutkana Presl and wood rose, R. gymnocarpa Nutt. in T. & G. Possibilities for the raspberries include thimbleberry Rubus parviflorus Nutt., red raspberry, R. idaeus L., or black raspberry, R. leucodermis Dougl. ex T. & G. Clark's version is, "Snow is about 4 Inches deep."The Indians were actually Nez Perces.Clark writes, "Capt Lewis & Several men Sick."
