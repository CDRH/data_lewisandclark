This table follows Codex Fe.Clark has "52 a."Clark has only "f."Lewis (Codices Fe and P) and Clark (Codex I) both have extensive marginal remarks for this month, many of which do not refer to the weather, but to the movements of the two captains and their respective parties. Some of the remarks in Lewis's journals appear to be in Clark's handwriting. Clark's substantive differences with Lewis's remarks are noted.The remainder of his entry is from a separate remark in Codices Fe and P.This actually occurred on August 11, as Clark notes in his weather remarks in Codex I. Even there a line points the remark to August 12.Clark in Codex I says, "Capt Lewis arrived at the Snake Indian camp on C[olumbia]." A line points the remark of August 13 to August 14.Clark's remark in Codex I.Clark adds, "I arrive at the Snake Indian village on the waters of Columbia River."The remainder of this entry is from a separate remark in Codices Fe and P.Clark writes, "I proceeded down the river 70 miles & Set out on my return."Clark says simply, "on the Columbian waters."Clark's version is, "I rejoin the party at the Snake Indian village & purchase horses."Clark has, "Set out with the party from Snake Indian village."
