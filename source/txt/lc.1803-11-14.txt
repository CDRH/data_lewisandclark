The pills (provided by Benjamin Rush) were a strong laxative. They consisted generally of ten grains of calomel, or mercurous chloride, and fifteen grains of jalap, or pulvis jalap, from the roots of the Exogonium jalapa of Mexico. They were used extensively on the expedition for treating gastrointestinal disturbances.
