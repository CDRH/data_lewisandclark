In this edition the data are placed at the end of the appropriate month. Included here are tables and observations from Lewis's Weather Diary and Clark's Codex C (see Introduction and Appendix C). The two sets of tables and remarks are combined to provide complete information without repetition. In this edition I have followed the Weather Diary as far as it goes and compared Codex C or other miscellaneous weather notes with it. It is uncertain which was the original source and which the copy, but internal evidence points to the Weather Diary as being the principal document. Insignificant changes between sources, such as word choice and sentence structure, are ignored; substantive differences are noted. The "remarks" include some events unrelated to weather, such as natural phenomena or daily events; they are retained with the weather data. Sometimes the remarks form a column of the table, sometimes they are placed separately. This edition follows the latter practice. In the Weather Diary, Lewis wrote the introductory material, the column headings, and the January 1 observations; the rest of the observations for the month seem to be in Clark's hand. Lewis was in St. Louis most of the time. There is also a copy of this January 1804 table in the notebook Voorhis No. 4 in Clark's hand, made at an unknown date. It appears to follow the Weather Diary more closely than it does Codex C, but some ten days (January 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16) are missing and there are various discrepancies, chiefly in the remarks; some of those appear to be the result of writing remarks on the wrong line. In general, the Voorhis No. 4 table appears to be a hasty copy made later for some unknown purpose and does not seem worthy of detailed notice here.Clark, in Codex C, adds "(Missouri)" here.Clark, in Codex C, does not have this paragraph.
These remarks are from Lewis's Weather Diary, in his hand, under the heading "Notes of refference for Jany 1804." Clark repeats them in Codex C under the title given here.
Clark has 8° in Codex C.
In his Weather Diary, Lewis placed a column for remarks within the table of observations; Clark, in Codex C, placed his remarks on separate pages—the style followed here. The preliminary note was at the head of Lewis's column of remarks.In Codex C, under the second column of weather for this date, Clark has "c. a. r. h." rather tahn "c & r."
The "f" in first weather column is written over "N W."
The "S" in the first weather column is written over "shfty."
The "f" in the first weather column is written over "W N W."
The remarks in the Weather Diary are by Clark from January 2 on.
In Codex C, Clark entered no remarks for January 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18, probably because of the illness he noted in the Weather Diary.Clark, in Codex C, says, "No ice passing to day."
Clark, in Codex C, has "Ice running out of the Missoury, 9 In thick    Snow 2½ In Deep."
Clark, in Codex C, writes, "Ice running out of the Missouri, Snow 5¾ In Deep."
There are no remarks in Codex C for January 25, 26, and 27.
Clark, in Codex C, adds "from Kahokia."
