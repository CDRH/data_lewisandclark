Biddle's notation at the head of this sheet of the Field Notes (document 42) reads, "Aug. 12 to 14."The "stone" exposed below the mouth of the Little Sioux consists of shales and some limestone of Cretaceous age.Eastern red cedar.A coyote, Canis latrans, one of the most characteristic western animals, then little known to science. Apparently they did not actually get a specimen until September 18, 1804. Cutright (LCPN), 85; Hall, 2:924–28.Clark used an asterisk as a reference to a continuation of the narrative after the courses and distances. The material is brought together for ease of reading.John B. Thompson had previously held this position in Floyd's squad (see above, July 8, 1804). Apparently he had proved unsatisfactory.Clark wrote this course and description in red ink or chalk. There are also some numbers (40, 8, and No. 12) in red and the profile of a boy under the text (fig. 16).In either Monona or Woodbury County, Iowa, near the county line. Atlas map 15; MRC map 27; MRR maps 73, 74.Another indication that they still intended to send back Corporal Warfington's squad in the near future. In fact, they did not do so until April 7, 1805.
