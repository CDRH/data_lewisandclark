They differ sufficiently to justify printing both here under the date given for the first set, July 17–19, 1805. Someone has crossed through the first and rougher set of notes. Because the clearer set of notes and other material is placed in the midst of this first set, they have been slightly rearranged to preserve the integrity of each.This paragraph appears to be in Lewis's hand.Clark wrote this set of notes on four sheets (eight pages) he inserted in Voorhis No. 1 in the midst of the set of survey notes mentioned in the note above. This second set is much neater than the first and differs considerably from it, so both are printed.This paragraph is at the top of the map of the Great Falls area (see figure) together with an astronomical observation dated June 20, 1805, which is placed by date.This note on the Great Falls portage appears at the end of Voorhis No. 1, and is here
placed with other portage survey material.This entire line and the total figures below appear to be in Lewis's hand.
