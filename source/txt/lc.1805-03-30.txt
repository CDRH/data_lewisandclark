Biddle inserted this red-inked note to himself to consult Sergeant Ordway's journal, which he was using in preparing his History. Possibly this enabled him to detect the misdating of entries by Clark. Clark had no March 31 entry in either his Field Notes or Codex C, probably due to this same misdating, and Biddle's note may mean that he would have to consult Ordway for the events of that day, which the entry in his History shows that he did.
