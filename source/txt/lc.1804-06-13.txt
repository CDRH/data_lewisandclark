Some figures are written to the side of this entry: 2½, 3, 1½, 2, and a total of 9.The words crossed out are immediately under the date. Possibly Clark intended to write here a list of papers to be sent back to Secretary Henry Dearborn with the intended return party.It would appear that this bend in Chariton County, Missouri, was cut off by a change in the course of the Missouri River later in the nineteenth century. The curve and a remaining lake are quite evident on MRC map 10. It was later known as Bowling Green Bend. Coues (HLC), 1:22 n. 48.One of those was probably later Palmer Creek. Ibid.; MRC map 10.The Missouris, or Missourias, called after the river, when first noticed in 1673 were situated at the mouth of the Grand River (see below, n. 6) in Missouri, about where Clark places the village here. They are said to have been a large and important tribe before they were almost annihilated during the latter half of the eighteenth century by Mississippi River tribes, particularly the Sauks and the Fox. Their earliest known village was near Miami Landing, now called the Utz site. Eventually they moved to the southwestern tip of Saline County, to a spot known as the Gumbo Point site. See also notes for June 15. By about 1798 they were forced to move up the Missouri River into Nebraska, to join the culturally related Otos; both tribes spoke the Siouan language of the Chiwere group and had economies based on hunting and horticulture. Henceforward the two tribes acted together and were treated by the United States as one. The last full-blooded Missouri is said to have died in Oklahoma in 1907. Chapman (OM); Hodge 1:911–12; Irving (IS); Bray (MIT).Grand River, one of the principal streams of northern Missouri, forms the boundary between Carroll and Chariton counties where it meets the Missouri River. It appears likely that the mouth of the Grand in 1804 was farther north above present Brunswick. It is not clear on which side of the Grand they camped. Nicollet (MMR), 361 ; MRC map 10.The headwaters of the Grand and its principal tributary, the Thompson River, are near the heads of the South and Middle Des Moines in southern Iowa. Petersen, 301–5.This may be an abbreviation for "fires," that is, families. Thwaites (LC), 1:47.Clark probably refers again to a bature, a sandy beach on the inside curve in a river. See June 4, 1804.This entry and the next are Lewis's observations from Codex O. Proceeding this date is the symbol for the planet Mercury.This may be the first of the "round bend Creeks." See Clark's and Floyd's entries of this day.Perhaps Palmer Creek, Chariton County, Missouri. Floyd's name, somewhat strange, is not used by others; Clark called it (with other streams at this point), "round bend Creeks."Sauk Indians."Missourie Indianes" and the passage of "village    at this place . . . in former times" was underlined in red by an unknown hand.This last sentence appears to be in the hand of No. 3."North" is written over "South."
