ClarkProbably Hanson Catlett. See above, January 31, 1804, n. 2.Aurora borealis.The first of the Detachment Orders in the Orderly Book (see Appendix C). The captains selected the men for their "Permanent Detachment," which would go with them to the Pacific, and Corporal Warfington's detachment, which would be sent back with dispatches from some yet undetermined point on the Missouri. Changes were made in these assignments over the next year. It is uncertain what the marks next to the names represent.Peter Wiser (Weiser) is mentioned later in the list. Possibly the name refers to Pierre (Peter) Cruzatte, the French boatman who may have joined at St. Charles in May and who went to the Pacific; his name could have been inserted later.These letters are in the upper right-hand corner of the second page and may have no relevance to this entry.Newman was tried and convicted of "mutinous expression" and expelled from the party. See below, October 13, 1804.Reed deserted and, after apprehension and trial, was expelled from the party. See below, August 18, 1804.These are the persons selected to be the returning party (see Appendix A). Warfington was in charge of that group, but changes were made from this list. Frazure (Frazer) was added to the permanent party, apparently in place of Reed (see below, October 8, 1804). April 1 is the last time Robertson's name appears. When he left the party is uncertain, but he may have been the man of Captain Stoddard's company mentioned by Whitehouse as being sent back on June 12, 1804. Biddle apparently added Reed's name here because Reed, after his expulsion, was sent with the return party. He did not add Newman, who also went back with that party.Someone crossed out the names of Newman and Reed on this list, no doubt after their expulsion from the party. The mark by the name of  Richard Worthington (Warfington) may refer to his being a corporal, not a private.Clark evidently signed for Lewis here.
