Part 1: Estimated Distances from Fort Mandan to the Pacific CoastClark prepared this extensive list of estimated distances for the route from Fort Mandan to the Pacific Coast as an apparent supplement to his route maps. This document is found in Codex I, pp. 2–12, apparently wholly in Clark's hand. Two other versions of this table exist. One is in the little field book with Clark's draft of his trip to the coast, January 6–10, 1806, and the other is in Voorhis No. 4. The one in the draft notebook is labeled, "Distances of the Mouthes of Rivers Creeks and the Most remarkable places from Fort Mandan & Lattiduds in 1805." It does not have the remarks that are found in the final column of the Codex I and Voorhis versions. The title for the Voorhis table is quite similar to the codex piece, with only some spelling differences and minor word changes. The tables in the draft and Voorhis notebooks have been compared to the one printed below. From the start the mileage figures from point-to-point and the accumulated mileage are in disagreement. The draft version appears at first to have been just that for Codex I, but later it digresses while the codex and Voorhis items more regularly agree with one another, eventually the draft version exceeds the other tables by four miles in the accumulated mileage column and remains so to the end. The codex and Voorhis notebooks vary by up to nine miles in early entries. There are few dissimilarities for the latitudes between the three versions, while the column of remarks in the codex and Voorhis documents differ only slightly in wording. Another partial version of a similar table exists in microform and photostatic copies at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and the National Archives, Washington, D.C. (see Appendix C). That table lists geographic points from the mouth of the Missouri River to the Great Falls of the Missouri, together with mileage figures and occasional latitude readings. Here again there are discrepancies with other tables but mainly in terms of minor mileage differences. All of this material was eventually gathered with similar tables from Codex C and other documents (see Chapter 10) including information from the return journey and made into one comprehensive table for the entire trip and placed in Codex N and Voorhis No. 4. That table will appear in volume 8 of this edition. Clark had, of course, kept all these distances and other data carefully in his journals, and at Fort Clatsop he apparently brought them together in several versions. Unlike the record of streams and distances prepared at Fort Mandan (see Chapter 10), this compendium covers territory almost entirely unexplored previously by whites, which made it all the more significant. It also includes the names of the Indian tribes the party encountered and some explanations of names they bestowed on streams. The Indians are covered more fully in the next part of this chapter.

A red vertical line runs through the two distance columns on pp. 2–3. Book number 14 is Codex N in Biddle's numbering system (see Appendix B and Appendix C).At the top of this page in Codex I (p. 4) in red ink and apparently in Clark's hand, are the following words: "S Book No. 14. Nearest rout and acssess."Clark reverses this item with the next in his draft field book.Called "flathead River" in the field book. In Codex I and Voorhis No. 4, "Clark's" appears to have been added to a blank space."Labrich [Labiche] Creek" in the field book. In Codex I, "Horse Vally" appears to have been substituted for an erased word.Next to this heading are these words by Clark in red ink: "See Book No. 14 or last Book."Next to this heading are these words by Clark in red ink: "See in the last Book No. 14." The subtotals "56" above, and "97" below, are also written in red. Voorhis No. 4 adds cumulaive mileages for each entry.Called "portage rapid" in the field book. In Codex I the word appears to be a later entry.This line in Codex I appears to have been substituted for some erasures. It does not appear in Voorhis No. 4.This word in Codex I appears to have been added to a blank space.Again perhaps an addition to a blank space in Codex I.Another apparent addition in Codex I."Clark's River" in the field book. In Codex I and Voorhis No. 4 the word appears to have been substituted for some erasures. See note at October 22, 1805. The number "180" appears to be an addition to a blank space in Codex I.The words appear to have replaced erasures in Codex I.Much of this entry appears to replace erasures in Codex I.Here and in the next entry of Codex I the name appears to replace erasures.In Voorhis No. 4 this entry has it: "To the enterance of Chah wah na hiook river on the Stard Side." The mileage "4025" appears to be crossed out.Following this entry Voorhis No. 4 adds: "To the Narrows of the Mountain and lower part of the Columbia Vally."In Voorhis No. 4 Clark adds the "Cla-mor-to-micks" and "Potoash" tribes.After this entry in Voorhis No. 4 Clark adds: "Qui eet to, Chil lâte hackle, Qui ne chart, and Pailsh" tribes.This entry is missing from Voorhis No. 4.Many of the place-names in this section appear to have been added to blank spaces or substituted for erasures in Codex I.Here on the right margin of p. 11 of Codex I appears a small sketch of Point William, today's Tongue Point, Oregon (fig. 51).Cumulative mileages are given for the following entries in Voorhis No. 4.Following this entry in Voorhis No. 4 there appears some enumeration of Indian tribes as are given in part 2 of this chapter. There are some small differences in numbers.After this section Clark adds the following in the field book. He is apparently estimating courses and distances for the return trip over the Rocky Mountains. See also some similar notes in part 3 of this chapter.
