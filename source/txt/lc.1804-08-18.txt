The sentence between parentheses is an interjection in the main narrative.The official record of this trial does not appear in the Orderly Book or elsewhere. See n. 5, below.August 18 was Lewis's thirtieth birthday.Various miscellaneous undated material, much of it crossed out, is written in the middle of the August 18 entry at the top of the sheet of the Field Notes (document 43). The course and description are in Lewis's hand, the remaining material is in Clark's. Some of the material seems to be tentative beginnings for speeches, made to or by the Indian chiefs. Material dealing with this council on document 43 is written in different directions on the sheet and has been sorted out as well as can be done.In this Codex B entry the sentences relating to Reed's trial and punishment are crossed out. No account of the episode appears in the narrative of the day in Biddle's History, although he notes Reed's apprehension among the events of August 17. Coues (HLC), 1:77–78.This interlineation is at the top of a page in Codex B, probably inserted there because space was available.Lewis's observation from Codex O.Actually, Big Horse was a Missouri Indian, and Little Thief ("petevaliar" for the French petit voleur, "little thief"), an Oto. Also in the group was apparently the Frenchman the party had met on August 2; see Clark's entry for that day and for the next.This is the last daily entry in Floyd's journal; two days later he was dead. See the Introduction in volume 9. Following this entry are eighteen blank pages, then a single page with the following:
