The dates follow Clark's in Codex C.Clark's remark ends here.Clark has no remarks for this date.In Clark's Codex C these remarks are placed, undated, after his remarks for March 19. The root is the purple coneflower which Clark mentioned in his regular entries as having collected on March 21, that date probably being correct.Clark's undated version of this remark reads "The Indians raise a kind of artechokes which they Say is common in the praries. well tasted."
