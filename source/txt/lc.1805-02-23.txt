All hands employed in Cutting the Perogus Loose from the ice, which was nearly even with their top; we found great difficuelty in effecting this work owing to the Different devisions of Ice & water    after Cutting as much as we Could with axes, we had all the Iron we Could get & Some axes put on long poles and picked throught the ice, under the first water, which was not more the 6 or 8 inches deep—    we disengaged one Perogue, and nearly disingaged the 2nd in Course of this day which has been warm & pleasent    vised by a no of Indians, Jessomme & familey went to the Shoes Indians Villag to day

OrdwaySaturday 23nd Feby. 1805.    a pleasant morning.    all the party employed cutting the Ice away from round the 2 perogues.    towards evening by hard cutting with the water up within an Inch of filling it. Started it loose with pryzes and pulled it out on the Ice & turned on its Side.    loosed the Ice from round the other.

GassSaturday 23rd.    We had fine pleasant weather, and all hands were engaged in cutting away the ice from the boat and the other periogue. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon we had the good fortune to get both free from the ice; and in the three following days succeeded in getting them all safe upon the bank. On the 27th we made preparations for making periogues to pursue our voyage in.

The white pirogue; see Weather Diary remarks for this date.Lewis's astronomical observation from Codex O.This collection of astronomical data is on document 35 of the Field Notes and is placed here according to the date given. Note the references to Andrew Ellicott and Robert Patterson, from whom Lewis learned navigation.This material is on document 35 of the Field Notes, upside-down to the preceding astronomical data, and is placed according to the date on that material. Most of it appears to be a list of data to be noted about rivers, similar to Jefferson's instructions to Lewis and similar to the captain's survey of rivers and creeks. The last line appears to be a note about a map correction. There are also a number of other wordings, jottings, and doodles on this sheet which are not transcribed here.
