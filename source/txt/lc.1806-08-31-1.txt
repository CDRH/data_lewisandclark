The rains which have fallen in this month is most Commonly
from flying Clouds which pass in different directions, those
Clouds are always accompanied with hard winds and Some-
times accompanied with thunder and lightning—    The river
has been falling moderately Since the third of the month.    the
rains which has fallen has no impression on the river than
Causing it to be more muddy and probably prevents its falling

some rain to day.Lewis's weather table for August 1806 is in Codex L, p. 145. He apparently ceased keeping it after his reunion with Clark on August 12, as with his other journal-keeping, due to the wound he received on the eleventh. Clark's weather table appears separately.These remarks are found only in the margin of Lewis's weather table.Clark's weather table for August 1806 appears in Codex M, pp. 146–47 reading backwards).Clark has a number of remarks in the margin of his weather table for this month. There is only one separate remark for the month, on the twenty-second. See note for that date.See botanical notes for August 9, 1806.Pin cherry. The "read Heart" cherry is probably the black cherry; see Lewis's entry of August 12, 1806.Aurora borealis.Clark's only separate remark for the month begins here with "The rains."
