This material is separated from the November 16 entry by a blank half page. It may not have been written on the sixteenth but surely was completed during the time the party was at the juncture of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. It and the next entry are placed here because of this entry's position in the Eastern Journal.The sextant used by the expedition was purchased from Thomas Whitney of Philadelphia, as were many of the other scientific instruments. It was "a brass sextant of 10 Inches radius." Lewis's List and Supplies [June 30, 1803], Jackson (LLC), 1:69, 82, 96; Lewis's description of astronomical instruments, July 22, 1804; Bedini (TT), 337–39, 483; Bedini (SILC), 55, 62–63.Lewis purchased the "Arnold's" chronometer, of "the most improved construction," from Philadelphia watchmaker Thomas Parker, and carried it in a special case. It was of English construction; the maker is not known, but it was commonly referred to as "Arnold's" because John Arnold of London was then one of the best-known makers of chronometers. See November 15, n. 1, above, and Lewis's description of astronomical instruments, July 22, 1804.

Courses other than due north, south, east, or west were expressed by the number of degrees the course varied from either due north or due south. Thus, "N. 30 ½ d E" would be thirty and one-half degrees east of due north, fifty-nine  and one-half degrees short of due east. The bearing may have been taken with a pocket compass, such as one of three purchased by Lewis from Whitney, or with the plain surveying compass. It is not clear whether Lewis and Clark took a bearing at the beginning of a particular course, sighting on the point for which they were headed, or whether they sighted back at the end of a course toward the point at which it began. Distances were apparently estimates. Greenwood, 57–59, 66–67.The pole, or rod, is a unit of measurement commonly given as 16 ½ feet. The link, mentioned below, is the standardized link, 7.92 inches, of the surveyor's chain made of wrought iron or steel. One chain of one hundred links measures 66 feet, or four poles, and eighty chains measures a mile. Lewis purchased a "two pole Chain" (33 feet) in Philadelphia in May 1803. Clark had some basic knowledge of surveying, and Lewis had been instructed by Ellicott and Patterson. Ibid., 53, 272; Lewis's List and Supplies [June 30, 1803], Jackson (LLC), 1:69, 82, 96.
