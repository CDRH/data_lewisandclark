Ordway says, "the people gathred on the Shore and Huzzared three cheers."William Christy, born in Pennsylvania, moved to Kentucky as a boy, where he was a neighbor of Clark's family, and served in the campaigns against the Indians north of the Ohio under Generals Arthur St. Clair and Anthony Wayne. He received a license to keep a tavern in St. Louis in 1806. Later he was secretary of the land claims commission (see September 20, 1806), fought Indians again in the War of 1812, and was the first auditor of public accounts of the new state of Missouri. He died in 1837.

"Estimated Distance" (reading back to front) across four pages, another blank page, and a final list of memoranda of two pages (also reading back to front), thus ending Ordway's third and final notebook of his journal of the expedition. The table of distances is similar to another one by Ordway found with his entry of October 10, 1804 (see also Clark's tables at the end of vols. 3 and 8 of this edition). The table reads as follows:

Due to wear and fading the material is barely legible. The following are words and phrases that are readable:
