GassTuesday 29th.    Seven men were sent out to hunt; six of whom returned. We waited here until 5 o'clock P. M. for the man, who had not come in, and then proceeded three miles, passed Deer creek on the south side, and encamped a short distance above it on the same side. A periogue and eight men had been left for the hunter who had not returned.

This second entry for May 29 is at right angles to the first on document 15. Under it is a sketch map of the Missouri River from Bonhomme Creek to above Tavern Creek, in St. Louis , Franklin, and St. Charles counties, Missouri. See fig. 9. Wood; MRC map 3.Joseph Whitehouse, who had been exploring a cave. The red pirogue, manned by the French engagés, stayed behind him.Probably Bailey Creek, entering the Missouri in Gasconade County, Missouri, near the Osage County line. MRC map 5; MRM map 14.Just above Bailey Creek, very near the Osage-Gasconade county line. MRC map 5; MRM map 14.This and the following paragraph are in pencil, written in the angle between the two May 29 entries on document 15. They are nearly illegible. Apparently they belong to the period when the party camped at the mouth of the Gasconade.These measurements, which Clark took at the mouth of the Gasconade on May 28, are written in ink below the previous penciled paragraphs.The swivel gun was a small cannon widely used by armies, navies, and fur traders in this period. As the name implies, it was placed on a Y-shaped mount that swiveled, giving it great flexibility. It could fire a solid shot or a number of smaller projectiles and was therefore a useful antipersonnel weapon. During the expedition's tense encounter with the TetonSioux (September 25, 1804), the swivel was loaded with sixteen musket balls, each of which would probably have gone through more than one victim. The gun probably had a bore of less than two inches and fired a ball weighing about one pound. The expedition also had two blunderbusses, likewise mounted on swivels; these were large, bell-mouthed shoulder arms, used with buckshot like heavy shotguns. All of these weapons were probably mounted on the walls of Fort Mandan during the winter of 1804–5. The Corps cached all three at the Great Falls of the Missouri  in June 1805, and recovered them in August of the following year. They gave the little cannon as a gift to the Hidatsa chief Le Borgne (One Eye) during the return trip in order to win his good will; the blunderbusses were brought back to St. Louis. Russell (GEF), 251–65; Russell (FTT), 45–48, 77–84.Lewis's observation from Codex O.Otherwise called the red pirogue.This is the fair copy entry; the original version of Whitehouse's journal has no entry for this date.According to John Ordway and Patrick Gass, they encamped on the south side, in Gasconade County, Missouri.
