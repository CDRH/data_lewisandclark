This undated material is on the reverse of document 4 of the Field Notes on which the December 31–January 3 entries are written. On half of this side is a map by Clark (see fig. 6)."Sandy C" on fig. 6, the map on the reverse of document 4 of the Field Notes. Present Sandy Creek enters the Mississippi in Lincoln County, Missouri.Fort Don Carlos, erected by the Spanish in 1768. Clark has apparently confused it with Fort Orleans, established in 1723 in Carroll County, Missouri, by Etienne de Bourgmont (see below, July 5, 1804). The sources for Clark's information on these places is not known. Osgood (FN), 12 n. 7.Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, founded Fort Crèvecoeur in January 1680 on the Illinois River near the village of the Peoria Indians. It was near present East Peoria, Tazewell County, Illinois Guide, 23, 273.Perhaps referring to six men left at the Arkansas (Quapaw) Indian villages a few miles up the Arkansas River from the Mississippi by La Salle's lieutenant Henri de Tonti in 1686. Osgood (FN), 12 n. 9.Fort Prudhomme was established at the third Chickasaw Bluff, near modern Natchez, Mississippi, in 1682. Osgood (FN), 12 n. 1.There are lead and zinc deposits near the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in Kentucky. Cumberland Island, a large island about ten miles up the Ohio from the mouth of the Tennessee is opposite the mouth of present Caney Creek, on which galena ore was discovered. Fifteen miles northeast is the Sheridan mining area. Osgood (FN), 12–13 n. 3. The primary lead ore is galena, which is dark gray, but secondary ores near the surface include the white minerals cerussite and anglesite, which are products of weathering. The principal primary ore of zinc is sphalerite, sometimes also called blackjack, but an important secondary (weathering) ore is smithsonite (ZnCO₃), known also as white ore or bone ore. Brobst & Pratt, 317–18, 701–2.These lists, scattered in various places, apparently represent an attempt by Clark to evaluate the men and determine who should be retained. The numbers following may be calculations of how many men would be needed and how they should be placed on the different vessels. The dots, dashes, zeros, checks, and plus signs beside the names may have had some relevance that is not understood now.
