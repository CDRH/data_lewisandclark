Among them were Corporal Richard Warfington and Privates Hugh Hall, Thomas P. Howard, and John Potts. The other four, whose names are unknown, were rejected. Clark's comment suggests that Campbell had sent some of his less desirable men. See Appendix A. Appleman (LC), 62, 366 n. 54.See Lewis to Clark, December 17, 1803, Jackson (LLC), 1:144.Born in Switzerland, Charles Gratiot came to Montreal in 1769 and engaged in the fur trade, establishing a store at Cahokia in 1777. During the Revolution he was of assistance to George Rogers Clark, and so was probably known to William Clark. In 1781 he moved to St. Louis, married into the prominent Chouteau family, and became himself a leading fur trader and citizen. The formal transfer of Upper Louisiana on March 10, 1804, took place on the portico of his home. He helped Lewis and Clark considerably in the months before the start of the expedition.
