OrdwayTuesday 14th    we Set out at light, & walked along down the hills past the
Graves.    we Saw also a nomber of large holes in the Ground where they used to hide their peltry &C. in, when they went out hunting and when they returned they would dig it out again, I put up a paper on a pole Stuck in a round hill, as a Signal for G. Drewyer &.C—    then we crossed the Small run which came in to the bottom from behind the hills, we then crossed this bottom prarie which is high & verry rich & formed a handsom vallie for a long distance back between the hills which is nearly half a mile wide across    
above the village the Mahar Creek makes down along the South Side next to the hills, we crossed the creek about 10 yds. wide, and ascended the hill    below the creek we See a nomber of beaten pathes leading in different directtions, but no Signs of any being their lately.    we walked along the ridge which is high prarie all back as far as my [eye?] could behold.    we expected to have found Some corn or Something growing Some where in the bottom but we could not see any appearence of anythig being planted this year, we walked along the Ridge about 1½ miles then decended the hill & passed along, Round S. S. of a long pond which lay between the hills & the Missouri, we crossed the out let of the pond which is verry mirry along the edge of the pond.    we came to the Missouri and went up.    crossed the mouth of the Mahar creek, & Returned to the Boats about 10 oClock A.

The following address in Clark's hand is under the entries (August 13, 14, and 15) on this sheet of the Field Notes (document 42), at right angles to the rest of the writing. The last sentence is upside-down to the address. Presumably Clark used this sheet as an envelope to send a letter to Lewis at St. Louis during the winter at River Dubois: "Capt. Meriwether Lewis, S. Louis, pr. Mons Vansee Gutaru, I will thank you to send the letter directed to [prukhon? prudhom?] and Smiley to the post office to go by the next mail." Considering Clark's usual difficulty with French names, the bearer of the letter may have been Vincent Guitard, a resident and landowner in the St. Louis area for some years. Houck, 2:55, 101.The Omahas were at one time closely related to the Poncas; both spoke dialects of the same language of the Dhegiha group of the Siouan linguistic family, and both were horticulturists and hunters. The Omahas may have settled in Nebraska by 1700 or even a little earlier. By 1750 they were generally in Nebraska, although they hunted and camped on both sides of the Missouri River in the region. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, they made much trouble for the French traders who wished to ascend the Missouri River beyond the Omaha village to trade with the Arikaras and Mandans. During the winter of 1799–1800 they experienced a catastrophic smallpox epidemic that is supposed to have reduced their numbers to about 900–1500 people, which would be close to Clark's estimate of "300 men," counting three to five persons per adult male. (Personal communication of John Ludwickson.) Thereafter they did not apear as an obstacle to white expansion. Clark's statement that they had no corn is hard to understand, for they regarded corn as one of their most important food sources. He may mean that they planted corn but then went buffalo hunting and so did not stay home to tend their crop, which would be consistent with Plains Indian horticultural practices. His statement in Codex A that they had no houses may be explained by the remark here that the village was in ruins; ordinarily at least the more industrious families had permanent earth lodges. The condition of the place may have resulted from the burning of the village during the smallpox epidemic, which may have left their society in disarray for some time, delaying their efforts to rebuild. Ordway says that they had about three hundred "cabins," meaning perhaps that he saw their burned remains. If the wooden frame of an earth lodge was burned, the lodge would collapse. Hodge, 2:119–21; Fletcher & La Flesche, 1:96–98, 261–70, passim; Smith (OI); Nasatir (BLC), 1:28off.Here ends the notebooks journal Codex A, except for an astronomical observation of June 23, 1804, placed with that date. The words "Cho car tooch or Brarow" are on a page by themselves, and were probably jotted down as a note when Clark first heard the information. See entries at February 6 and July 30, 1804.Lewis's observation from Codex O.The pond appears on Atlas map 16.
