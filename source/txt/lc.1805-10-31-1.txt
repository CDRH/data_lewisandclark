Clark wrote a combined weather table for October, November, and December in Codex I, which we have separated by month. In the margin of the combined table were notes on their travels and weather remarks which we have placed after the October table.Clark's remarks are in Codex I and Voorhis No. 4; the former is followed here.In Vorrhis No. 4 substantially the same remark appears under October 8.In Voorhis No. 4 Clark writes, "first Vulture of the Columbia Seen to day," under October 28. This is the California condor. For October 29 he says, "I shot at a vulture"; the daily journals date the shooting of the first condor on October 30.In Voorhis No. 4 Clark here adds "to any I have ever seen."
