John Donegan (or Denegan) and Joseph Donegany (Donegani) were making thermometers in Philadelphia in 1785. Although thermometers are among Lewis's list of requirements for the trip, there is no direct evidence that any were purchased. Lewis kept temperature readings on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and Clark continued the practice at Camp Dubois, thus providing strong indirect evidence that thermometers were purchased in Philadelphia. This reference helps to confirm that supposition and to dispel the idea that the St. Louis physician Antoine Saugrain made thermometers for Lewis and Clark. Bedini (TT), 302–3; Jackson (LLC), 69, 75 n. 1.The phrase "Say (10)" at the bottom of the obverse of document 4 is repeated at the top of document 5; it was apparently a device for keeping the loose pages in order. This is the first sheet to use such a device, and it does not appear to be part of a larger system. On later sheets Clark used "O, ancore" and "say on." Because there is no indication of missing material, we should not suppose that nine sheets preceded this one, leaving us to discover six missing sheets to add to the three that we now have in advance of this one.
