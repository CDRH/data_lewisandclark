Appleman (LC), 351–52; Atlas map 23; MRC maps 40, 41.The narrative continues on document 59 of the Field Notes. At the top of the page Biddle has "Sept 27," badly smudged, "Sept. 27 1804," and "& 28."The offer of women was a combination of hospitality and diplomacy—a custom repeated by later tribes which the party met. See Ronda (LCAI), 36–37, 62–64.Apios americana Medic., Indian potato, groundnut, or potato-bean, described more extensively by Lewis in an undated entry. Fernald, 936. Cf. Criswell, cx, 67; Cutright (LCPN), 91. The reference to hominy indicates the approximate size of the small starch tubers which when cooked together resemble hominy. Present sources do not show the plant this far north along the Missouri River. Barkley, 159.Their first mention of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, which they would not see alive until the following spring. A description had been published in Great Britain this same year (1804), based on a specimen obtained in the Canadian Rockies.

They are placed here as indicated. His insertions are in red for the most part, faint and difficult to read.Pemmican was meat dried and pulverized, mixed with melted fat and stored in sealed leather satchels; various kinds of berries might be added to improve the flavor. Other kinds of meat than buffalo might be used. Best results were obtained in a sunny, dry climate like that of the Great Plains. Pemmican was a basic travel ration with Indians and fur traders. The North West and Hudson's Bay companies carried on a considerable trade with the northern Plains tribes to obtain pemmican for their employees in the subarctic. Pemmican comes from the Cree word pĭmĭkân, "manufactured grease." Wentworth; Hodge, 2:223–24; Secoy, 49–50, 60.Biddle is comparing the argali (Ovis ammon), a big-horned sheep of Asia, with the North American bighorn, either thinking them the same species or finding the argali the only known comparable animal.Probably tipis.Prairie turnip (and other common names), Psoralea esculenta Pursh.The word "Savages" is written over "Indians."
