"Viele Pauchr" is Clark's version of the French "Vide Poche" (empty pocket), a derisive name for the town of Carondelet, perhaps descriptive of its declining fortunes in comparison to neighboring St. Louis. Carondelet (after bearing various earlier names) was named for François Luis Hector, Baron de Carondelet, Spanish governor of Louisiana from 1791 to 1797. By Clark's time it may have numbered 250 residents. The town has now been absorbed by St. Louis. Houck, 2:63–64; Thwaites (EWT), 22:215 and n. 1224.Cahokia, in St. Clair County, is the oldest town in Illinois (although Fort Crèvecoeur has also been claimed to be the first permanent village. See Alvord, 100). Today it has been virtually absorbed by East St. Louis. The name comes from a small band of the Illinois confederacy. By 1800 the population was over 700, but with the rise of St. Louis, and East. St. Louis, the town declined. McDermott (OC); Hodge, 1:185–86; Illinois Guide, 492–93.
