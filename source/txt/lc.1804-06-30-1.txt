These are observations of natural phenomena related to seasonal change and climate, such as plant ripening and animal migrations, rather than weather data as such. Those given follow Lewis, but the comments of both men are virtually identical. They are placed at the end of the appropriate month, as before.Whip-poor-will. See June 4, 1804.
