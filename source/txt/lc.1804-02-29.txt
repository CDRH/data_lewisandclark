Significant variations from Clark's Codex C are noted. Lewis's ditto marks in the river column do not seem to mean a repeat of the item above; they appear to be spacers.Clark, in Codex C, has river rise 1½ inches for February 2.In the first column of weather "f" is written over "N W."Codex C gives the river rise as 1½ inches for February 21.The second column of thermometer readings gives 28 in Codex C.The first column of thermometer reading in Lewis's Weather Diary could be either 21 or 4. It is clearly 4 in Codex C.These remarks follow Lewis's Weather Diary, kept by Clark from February 19. Variations from Codex C are noted below.Numbers (1, 4, 2, 3) whose purpose is unclear were inserted at the end of remarks for February 3, 4, 5, and 8.Clark, in Codex C, also says, "a quantity of Soft ice running" and "Swans passing."Probably the great blue heron, Ardea herodias [AOU, 194], which is still often called a crane.Clark, in Codex C, adds here "Sugar trees run."In Clark's Codex C the last word appears to be "mars," presumably meaning "marsh."There are no remarks for February 28 and 29 in the Weather Diary. Those given are from Codex C. On the flyleaf of Codex P are remarks on the weather by Lewis for February 28 and 29 and the month of March, in Lewis's hand. Those for February are substantially the same as those given here; in the February 29 entry, "I" is substituted for "Cap Lewis," which is struck out. Lewis left River Dubois sometime after February 20 and before February 29.
