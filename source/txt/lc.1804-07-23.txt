Our people were all busily engaged in hunting, making oars, dressing skins, and airing our stores, provisions, and baggage. We killed two deer and caught two beaver. Beaver appear plenty in this part of the country.
We continued here to the 27th. On the 24th there were some showers; but during the remainder of the time there was clear weather. Our people were generally employed as before. The hunters killed five more deer; and the two men returned from the Indian village, without finding any of the natives.

There are no extant Clark route maps of the Missouri to Camp White Catfish, except for a few sketch maps in the Field Notes (figs. 6, 9, 10, 14, and 15). It seems likely that there were twelve maps of the river that are now lost. See Atlas, 7. The map Clark was working on was not sent back at this time, since a return party was not dispatched. The soldiers for the intended return party were of Corporal Richard Warfington's squad, consisting at this time of Frazer, Boley, Dame, Tuttle, and White (see above, May 26, 1804). They were "from Illinois" in the sense that their unit, Captain Amos Stoddard's artillery company, was stationed in the "Illinois country." See Appendix A.A boil or abscess.Lewis's observation from Codex O.Whitehouse also uses this designation for Cruzatte.Cruzatte.Drouillard and Pierre Cruzatte.To the Oto village east of Yutan, Saunders County, Nebraska.Apparently Cruzatte, with terminology used also by Ordway.Whitehouse's spelling of Oto and Pawnee.
