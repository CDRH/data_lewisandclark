The columns are printed correctly here to avoid confusion.Clark has "0 <a>."Clark has "45 b" here in Codex C and "43 b" in Voorhis No. 4.There are several discrepancies between Lewis and Clark on this date; in Codex C Clark's sunrise weather is "f"; his 4 p. m. temperature is "22 a"; his 4 p. m. weather is "C"; his 4 p. m. wind is "W"; his river rise is 2 inches. His table in Voorhis No. 4 agrees with Lewis.These remarks follow Lewis's in his Weather Diary; the dates are taken from Clark's Codex C. Clark has remarks for December 1 and 2 in Voorhis No. 4 that are not found in the other two notebooks.Clark appears to have crossed out this remark in his Codex C.From here Clark writes "opposit Fort Mandan." The remainder of the information in this remark is in Clark's remark for December 8. Lewis has no remarks for that date.Clark's remarks in Codex C; Lewis has no remarks for this date. In Voorhis No. 4 Clark writes "I hunt    3 men frosted."Clark notes this hunting trip in Voorhis No. 4 (and not in Codex C) and adds "no blanket" after referring to Lewis's remaining out all night.Clark's Codex C remarks end at this point.Clark has no Codex C remarks for this date; in Voorhis No. 4 he writes "W C. huntig" for December 16 and 17.Clark's remarks in Codex C for December 24 and 25 agree with Lewis's; in Voorhis No. 4, however, he has "Snow very much" and "do" for the two dates. In that notebook he places "Complete the Fort" under December 23.One of the few indications of how they passed their time at Fort Mandan. It is unclear whether they brought a backgammon board and dice along or improvised them on the spot. The letters may have some reference to the game, but they do not resemble the modern system of scoring. Clark has nothing on this date.
