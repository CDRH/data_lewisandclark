Thursday October 3d    This morning was very pleasant.    The Men employed working on the Canoes went on, with much better spirit than they had done for several days past, being refreshed by the Horse meat that they had eat.—    The Canoes are now in great forwardness, & will be in readiness to receive their loading on board in a few days—    Our Men that had been sick for some time past recovered fast, & we are in hopes that they will be 
fully recovered by the time we are ready to proceed on down the River—
