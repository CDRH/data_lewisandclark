to praries are now laying their eggs and seting, their nests are in
great abundance.    the large batt, or night hawk appears.    the

rappid and placed in the shade of a tree.24thslight rain last night & a heavy shower this evening.27that 1 P M a black cloud which arose in the S W. came on accom-
panyed with a high wind and violent Thunder and Lightning;
a great quantity of hail also fell during this storm which lasted
about 2½ hours    the hail which was generally about the size of a
pigion's egg and not unlike them in form covered the ground to
the debth of 1½ inches.—    for about 20 minutes during this
storm hail fell of an innomus size driven with violence almost in-
credible, when they struck the ground they would bound to the
hight of ten to 12 feet and pass 20 or thirty before they touched
again.    after the rain I measured and weighed many of these
hail stones and found several weighing 3 ozs. and measuring
7 Inches in cirumference; they were generally round and per-
fectly sollid. I am convinced if one of those had struck a man on
the neaked head it would have knocked him down, if not frac-
tured his skull.—    Young blackbirds which are abundant in these
Islands are now beginning to fly28thCat fish no higher29thheavy gust of rain the morning and eveningLewis's tabled observations appear in Codex Fe and Clark's in Codex I. A few discrepancies and other points are noted below. The headings follow Lewis.Clark has "52 a."The dates for June 12–15 appear to be in Clark's hand in Codex Fe.Clark has only "f a r H."The captains have remarks both in the margin of their tabled observations and separately. These are combined for the fullest coverage without duplication or noting minor discrepancies of wording. Significant differences are noted below. Lewis's separate remarks are in Codex D (see Appendix C) and Clark's in Codex I.This remark is found only in Clark's Codex I.The sparrows could be any of a number of small brown birds. The larks are similarly
unidentifiable, as are the "Curloos" which could be any shorebird with a long bill. Holmgren, 29, 33. The "large batt, or night hawk" is again the common nighthawk.The turkey vulture, Cathartes aura [AOU, 325], already known to science. Holmgren, 28; Burroughs, 203–4.This remark in Codex Fe is in Clark's hand, as are those for June 14.In Codex I Clark has the marginal remark "returned from above the portage make
it 18 miles."Lewis dates this latter remark June 22 in Codex D and a slightly different version June 23 in Codex Fe.At this point in his remarks in Codex I Clark adds "during this emence Storm I was with the gereater part of the men on the portage    the men Saved themselves, Some by
getting under a Canoe others by putting Sundery articles on their heads    two was kocked down & Seven with their legs & thighs much brused." In his marginal remarks he has only "Falls of Missouri."This is Clark's marginal note in Codex I; the extent of the channel catfish at that time corresponds to distribution maps by present authorities.
