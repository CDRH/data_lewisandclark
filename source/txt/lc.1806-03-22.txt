See Thwaites (LC), 4:196 n. 1, on Lewis and Clark's relations with local chiefs.Perhaps mountain huckleberry, noted on February 7, 1806, but red huckleberry Vaccinium parvifolium Sm., or oval-leafed blueberry, V. ovalifolium Sm., are probably better candidates for Lewis's huckleberry than mountain huckleberry, a montane species.Drouillard and the Field brothers, according to the captains.Including Coboway.Colter stayed out.This entry appears near the end of Ordway's second book of his three-volume journal.
At least part of it must have been written after the return to St. Louis, since he counts the passage of time for the entire trip. It is placed here by date.
