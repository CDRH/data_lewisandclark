September 26, 1806ClarkFriday <25>th [EC: 26] of September 1806
a fine morning    we commenced wrighting &c.This is the last daily entry in Codex N and the last of the captains' daily journal entries for the expedition. Only a small portion of this page (p. 78) is taken up with text for September 25 and 26, the remainder is blank. The remainder of Codex N consists of blank pages (pp. 79–80, 86–121, 143), maps and notes on Bon Homme Island (pp. 81–85), and a number of miscellaneous notes (pp. 122–54, reading backwards), including Clark's weather diary for September 1806, Clark's summary of Lewis's journey from Travelers' Rest to the Great Falls of the Missouri, a map of that route, and several other items that are printed in Postexpeditionary Miscellany.The nature of this "wrighting" is not clear. Some of the letters they had begun a few days earlier may not yet have been finished; see September 24, 1806. It is likely that they were writing other letters in the next few days; see Lewis to an Unknown Correspondent, September 29, 1806. Jackson (LLC), 1:335–43. It is possible that Clark still had some of his journals to complete, although there are objections to this supposition. See the Introduction to the Journals.
