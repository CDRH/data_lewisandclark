Saturday 9th Feby. 1805. Some cloudy, the water which run over the Ice in the River has froze Smoth.    the Squaws from the 1st village are cutting their lodge timber on the opposite Side of the River from the Fort, So as to hale it up to the village on the Ice.—

Ordway records that Howard was tried the next day (February 10) for "Setting Such a pernicious example to the Savages." If any hostility developed with the local Indians, the knowledge that the walls were so easily scaled would be dangerous. Howard was found guilty and sentenced to fifty lashes, but the court recommended mercy and Lewis forgave him the punishment. For some reason the trial was not recorded in detachment orders. As far as the record goes, this was the last serious disciplinary problem of the expedition, or at least the last meriting trial by court-martial.
