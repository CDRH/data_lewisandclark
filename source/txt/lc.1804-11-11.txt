Sunday 11th Nov.    a clear and pleasant morning.    we commenced dobbing our huts & covering them &.C.    a frenchmans Squaw came to our camp who belonged to the Snake nation. She came with our Intreperters wife & brought with them 4 buffalow Robes and Gave them to our officers.    they Gave them out to the party. I Got one fine one myself.    chilly this evening &.c.


Lewis's astronomical observation from Codex O.Clark has both Shoshone Indian wives of Toussaint Charbonneau arriving, one of whom would be Sacagawea. It could be that two Indian women came, only one of whom 
was the wife of Charbonneau and not necessarily Sacagawea (see also Ordway's entry of November 20).
