Probably Matthew Lyon, who at this period was a resident of Kentucky and had a contract for army supplies. An Irish immigrant, Lyon gained fame in the 1790s as a Republican congressman and journalist from Vermont who stoutly opposed the Federalists, President John Adams, and the Alien and Sedition Acts, even to the point of going to jail. Jackson (LLC), 1:168 n. 1; Osgood (FN), 42 n. 3; Austin.Both Auguste and Pierre Chouteau were later reimbursed for expenditures of about this date. Lewis's Account [August 5, 1807], Jackson (LLC), 2:420.Apparently Lorimier had been on a mission to the Kickapoos for the United States. The wandering Kickapoos had various settlements in Missouri about this time, and the location of this one is hard to determine. See March 21, 1804. There was a village near Ste. Genevieve, but Lorimier would not have passed by St. Charles in returning from there to his home in Cape Girardeau; nor would he have passed a settlement on the Gasconnade River southwest of St. Louis. A location north of the Missouri River seems more likely. See May 22, 1804. Gibson, 22–23, 32, 38, 46, 52; Houck, 1:362.Perhaps the channel catfish, but later on (see July 24, 1804) this fish is treated as if it were previously unknown. Lee et al., 439; Cutright (LCPN), 425.Since Lewis did not actually arrive at St. Charles until May 20, Clark probably made the observation, which Lewis later copied into this Codex O entry.
