Mackay established this post, named for the reigning king of Spain, Charles IV, in November 1795, and wintered there. From here his companion, Evans, made his journey up the Missouri to the Mandan villages. The site was in Dakota County, Nebraska, southeast of Homer and south of Omaha Creek, but has not been discovered by researchers. Nasatir (BLC), 1:98–108; Atlas maps 7 and 16; MRC map 27; MRR maps 74, 75.This is perhaps the best-known Omaha village. It was called "Big Village," or Tonwontonga. Fletcher & La Flesche, 86, 99; Champe; Steinacher & Carlson, 29–36. It is in Dakota County, about one mile north of present Homer and six and a half miles south of Dakota City, on or near U.S. Highway 77. Appleman (LC), 335; Atlas map 16; MRC map 27; MRR map 75.In either Dakota County, Nebraska, or Woodbury County, Iowa, and a few miles south of present Dakota City. Atlas map 16; MRC 27; MRR map 75.One of the few references to "Carrn.," who is otherwise "E. Cann" and "Cane" (see July 4 and August 25, 1804). Presumably he was one of the French engagés, although he is not mentioned under that name in the list of boatmen of May 26, 1804. See Appendix A.Lewis's observation from Codex O.Omaha Creek, north of the Dakota-Thurston county line, Nebraska.According to Clark the detachment consisted of Ordway, Cruzatte, George Shannon, William Werner, and the mysterious "Carrn," for whom see Clark's entry for this date and Appendix A.Ordway's route this day cannot be determined with great accuracy, but he seems to have gone up Omaha Creek and then crossed it to what he conceived to be forks of the creek,
perhaps Fiddlers, Wigle, and South Omaha creeks. He then apparently camped on a hill near the Omaha village for the night. The village he discusses in this entry is Tonwontonga (see Clark's entry for this day). The rest of his discussion about the village, its surroundings, and
the Omaha people is apparently taken from Clark's entry of August 14 (see notes there).Probaby the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., and an unknown thistle, Cirsium sp.An unidentified legume with pea-like characteristics.No information seems to be available to identify a chief of the Poncas buried here. The statement may be unreliable or inaccurate.
