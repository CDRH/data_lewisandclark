The following material, at right angles to the main body of writing on the page, represents Clark's attempt to figure the amount of time necessary for the expedition. In hoping for a return by the end of 1805, he seriously underestimated the actual length of the voyage.On these "totals going out" there is quite a bit of overwriting and alteration of figures.In this material, upside down to the main body of writing on the page, Clark again tries to figure the number of men needed and their assignments to the different boats. The "Big boat" is the keelboat.The following paragraph begins the reverse of document 7 (printed upside down in Osgood). It appears to have been copied from some other source, perhaps as an exercise in writing by Clark.Here follow two sketches of the keelboat, which are the most important sources of information about that vessel (see fig. 7). The accompanying numbers are Clark's calculation of the amount of lumber necessary to build lockers on the boat. Other modifications may have been carried out at Camp Dubois during the winter. For further information, see above, August 30, 1803, and sources cited there.A key to the keelboat diagram. Clark drew a figure of the "pins to row by" in place of numbers on the last line.These words and the following paragraph are upside down on this page. In the right-hand corner written diagonally in Clark's hand in different-colored ink from the other writing are two apparently irrelevant jottings: [17°?] 27' 15" [and] Puberty.
