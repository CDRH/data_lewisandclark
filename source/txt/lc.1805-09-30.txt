Opposite this entry in Clark's Elkskin-bound Journal is a sketch map. See note for September 20, 1805.Clark's astronomical observations are repeated at the end of this entry (Codex G, p. 129) as apparently copied from the Elkskin-bound Journal. No differences in the figures between the two sets were found and the table is not printed here. Following that table is a course and distance table (Codex G, pp. 130–34) labeled: "Course & Distance from Clark's river to the Forks of Flat head river." The word "Clark's" appears to have been substituted for an erased word. "Flat head" also may have been added later. This covers the period September 11–25, 1805, with some days missing when the party was not on the move. We retain this table because of some differences with the Elkskin-bound Journal.The word appears to have been added to a blank space.Again, the word seems to have been added to a blank space, as does the word "Chopunnish" in the next course.This is the last daily entry in Ordway's first notebook journal (see Ordway's entry for
May 14, 1804). Then follows a table of "Computed distance" (next) from the party's Camp Fortunate, below the forks of the Beaverhead River, to the Pacific Coast.This table postdates the entries in this notebook. Ordway could have entered the material any time after the party arrived at the Pacific Coast. The notes may have been added to
blank pages in the notebook during the extended stay at Fort Clatsop. The table is placed here to indicate its placement in the original.The word "two" is written over "one."
