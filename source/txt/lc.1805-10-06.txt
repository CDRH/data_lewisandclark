Clark's astronomical observation here in Codex G, pp. 138–39, repeats the table found in the Elkskin-bound Journal; it is not printed here.The Clearwater River. Later the adopted the spelling "Kooskooskee." There are different explanations of the name; sources differ as to whether it is the Nez Perce name for the river. A common version is that koos keich keich means "clear water." Josephy (NP), 5; Space, 8. Or it may represent the Nez Perce term qu·sqú·s, "blue gray."
