Clark refers to the loup cervier, the French name for the Canada lynx. Alternatively, the pelt may have belonged to a northern bobcat, Lynx rufus. One skin of a "louservia," probably not the one Clark used in his gloves and cap, was sent to Jefferson in the spring of 1805. Reid, 102 n. 34; Burroughs, 92.Kóke is the Mandan word for pronghorn.Probably "constitutions."
