François Saucier was born near Fort de Chartres, in French Illinois, and moved across the Mississippi after the British occupation in 1765. In 1799 the Spanish authorities asked him to undertake the founding of a settlement at Portage des Sioux, of which he was appointed commandant—chief civil and military officer—serving until the United States took possession.
