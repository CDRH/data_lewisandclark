McLain, a prospective settler or a land speculator, is unidentified. Stewart (APN), 536.The "N C" may mean Natchez corn here and elsewhere. This is apparently what Clark has written on an undated list of articles for the trip. The list is on the reverse of Atlas map 3a and is placed here after the May 14 entry.From the list on reverse of Atlas map 3a it appears that Clark here means thirty half barrels rather than thirty and one-half barrels.These figures were inserted sideways in a blank space of this entry and go with a list of April 16. The number of 3115 was written over what appears to be 3366 in order to match some calculations that Clark did the next day. The "w" given here and elsewhere may stand for weight, but the letter or letters are very uncertain. Osgood interpreted it to be "lb." Osgood (FN), 36.
