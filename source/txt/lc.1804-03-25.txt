Sunday 25th    a fair morning    river rose 14 Inch last night, the men find numbers of Bee Trees, & take great quantities of honey, at 11 oClock 24 Sauckees Came pass from St Louis, and asked for Provisions    I ordered them 75 lb Beef, 25 lb flour, & 50 lb meal—     Guterge [Goodrich] returned with Eggs & [Toe?],Willard brought in 10 pr. Hinges    George Shannon Caught 3 large Cat fish—    The musquetors are verry bad this evening. Newman return with Letters & Papers from St Louis. (ancore)The Sauk (or Sac) and Fox Indians, so closely allied by this time that they appeared to outsiders to be virtually one tribe, lived on both sides of the Mississippi in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Callender (Fox); Callender (Sauk); Hagan.The first letter of this word could be "L." Possibly Clark means "roe" for fish eggs or  "tow," short fibers of flax, hemp, or jute; also known as oakum, it was often used for caulking seams or leaks in wooden boats and sometimes in treating wounds, all possible uses on the expedition. Both captains use "toe" for the verb "tow." However, "low" or "lowe" is an old Scottish or northern English word for a flame or candle.This word—presumably intended for "encore"—refers the reader to the next sheet of the Field Notes (document 10), where it is repeated before the March 26 entry.
