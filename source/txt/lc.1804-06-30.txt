Presumably a gray wolf, Canis lupus, which Lewis describes May 5, 1805. Hall 2:928–33.The Platte, or Little Platte, River in Platte County, Missouri, not to be confused with the stream of that name in Nebraska. In 1804, its mouth was probably several miles down the Missouri from its present position. "Platte" in French implies that the stream is relatively level, wide, and shallow. Clark's "Shole" is, of course, "shoal." Stewart (APN), 376; MRC map 15.Slaky means miry or muddy.Diamond Island was still on maps about 1890 but no longer is. The camp was in northeast Wyandotte County, Kansas, in the vicinity of the present village of Wolcott.
