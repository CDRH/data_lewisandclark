Reed and the 3 principal Chiefs of the Nations—    La Liberty they cought but he decived them and got away—    the object of those Chiefs comeing forward is to make a peace with the Mahars thro: us—.    as the Mahars are not at home this great object cannot be accomplished at this time    Set the Praries on fire to bring the Mahars & <Missouries> Soues if any were near, this being the usial Signal.

Friday August 17th    We remained still at same place, the men were employed repairing their Arms, and Cloathing; La'Beech <or> our Interpreter in the Evening came by himself to us and informed our Officers, that he had left the Zoto head chief, called the Pettit Wallow, & 12 of his Chiefs & Warriors with Read, who had deserted from us, 6 Miles from our Camp, and told our Captains, if any of the Mahaw Indians were with us, we should remain still, but if none of them were then among us, to fire off our <Cannon> Swivel, the Zoto Indians being at Warr with the Mahaws.—The "Fish Camp" was just north of 42° 21' N., so their calculated position is a little too far south. The longitude, more difficult to calculate to start with, is further off. The camp was near 96° 25' W. MRC map 27; MRR map 75.Reed canarygrass, see June 16, 1804. The other grasses Clark mentions may be specimens of Elymus sp. and Agropyron sp.From "LueBash" on, the writing appears to be in the hand of No. 3.Petit Voleur, or Little Thief; see Clark's entry for August 3, 1804.Whitehouse seems to imply that the Otos did not wish to meet the Omahas, which is 
contrary to Clark's implication in his note for this day.
