This is the last daily entry in the Field Notes (document 64). Since they intended to leave on April 4, Clark undoubtedly sealed up the Field Notes sheets to be sent back with the return party. Delays not mentioned in the journals kept them at Fort Mandan until April 7. During that time Clark did not add to the Field Notes but did add entries in Codex C through the seventh.A similar list of goods is found in an enclosure with Lewis to Jefferson, April 7, 1805, Jackson (LLC), 1:234–36. Someone, perhaps Biddle, has drawn red lines through the list.The tobacco seed is discussed in the botany section of Fort Mandan Miscellany. This line appears to be in Lewis's hand.Not a bird but the marten, a mammal of the weasel family. It is an inhabitant of evergreen forests, and some Mandan or Hidatsa had probably obtained the skin in trade. The journals do not indicate that the captains saw any live specimens on the expedition. Jones et al., 274–77; Burroughs, 73–74.On the possible fate of the buffalo hide, see Jackson (LLC), 1:241 n. 29, 2:734 n. 1.Lewis is probably confused here and means the mineralogical specimens that were sent back from Fort Mandan which are not noted as being packed anywhere else in this list. Cf. Jackson (LLC), 1:235. A further possible error is that the receiving list (the Donation Book at the American Philosophical Society, see Appendix C) numbers sixty-eight items. Hurried preparations for leaving in the final days at Fort Mandan could easily account for the errors. See Fort Mandan Miscellany for the list. Cutright (LCPN), 357 n. 21.Fragments of Mandan pottery said to be from the expedition are discussed in Wedel (PV).Perhaps the northern short-tailed shrew, Blarina brevicauda. If so, the species is another expedition discovery. Cutright (LCPN), 439; Jones et al., 53–56.Purple coneflower.Of the live animals shipped, only the prairie dog and one of the magpies reached Jefferson alive. Cutright (LCPN), 375–78.This list is crossed out in Codex C.
