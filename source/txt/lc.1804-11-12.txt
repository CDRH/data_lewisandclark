Probably venereal disease, about which they would be more frank in later entries. The passage has been crossed out in red, apparently by Biddle.Mandan creation accounts are found in Beckwith, 1–17. Clark later gave Biddle more information. See Nicholas Biddle Notes [ca. April 1810], Jackson (LLC), 2:520.The Mandan word for water is miniŋ; the Hidatsa term is mirí. The similarity of pronunciation would be striking to Lewis and Clark.Generally known as the Crows, from the French traders' term gens de corbeaux, they called themselves Absaroke, variously translated as crow, sparrowhawk, or bird people, or "anything that flies." They separated from the Hidatsas proper and the Awatixa in the eighteenth century, hence the similarity in language; their tongue was of the Siouan family. Although Clark here places them in the Black Hills, by the beginning of the nineteenth century they had been driven west from the hills of South Dakota by their enemies and were centered in the Yellowstone basin, including the valleys of the Powder, Tongue, and Bighorn rivers; Clark places them in the Yellowstone region in his "Estimate of Eastern Indians," prepared at Fort Mandan. Since they visited the Hidatsas regularly, white traders at that tribe's villages had seen them, and the Canadian Ménard (see above, October 25, 1804) claimed to have visited them on the Yellowstone before 1795; however, François-Antoine Larocque's account of his trip to the Yellowstone in 1805 is the earliest first-hand written account of them.
