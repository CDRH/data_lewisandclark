August 26, 1806ClarkTuesday 26th of August 1806
a heavy dew this morning    the hunters or Shannon & the 2 fields came up at Sunrise and we Set out, they had killed only 2 Small deer one of which they had eat    at 8 passed the place the Tetons were encamped at the time they attempted to Stop us in Septr. 1804, and at 9 A. M. passed the enterance of Teton River. Saw Several black tail or Mule deer and Sent out to kill them but they were wild and the hunters Could not get a Shot at either of them.    a fiew miles below the Teton river I observed a buffalow Skin Canoe lying on the S Shore and a Short distance lower a raft which induces me to Suspect that the Tetons are not on the Missouri at the big bend as we were informed by the Ricaras, but up the Teton river.    at Meridn. we halted on the N E. Side opposit a handsom leavel plain in which there is great quantities of plumbs which are not yet ripe.    we passed the enteranc of Smoke Creek and landed and Continued two hours to Stop a leak in the perogue and fix the Stearing oare, Saw great quantities of Grapes, they are black tho' not thurerly ripe.    at 5 P M. we landed a Louisells fort on Ceder Island, this fort is entire and every part appears to be in the Same state it was when we passed it in Septr. 1804. I observed the appearance of 3 fires in the houses which appeared to have been made 10 or 12 days past.    we proceeded on about 10 miles lower and encamped on the S. W. Side opposit our outward bound encampment of the 21st of Septr. 1804, a fiew miles above Tylors River.    we had a Stiff breeze from the S. E. which continued to blow the greater part of the night dry and pleasent.    as we were now in the Country where we were informed the Sceoux were assembled we were much on our guard deturmined to put up with no insults from those bands of Seioux, all the arms &. in perfect order. Capt. L. is Still on the mending hand    he walks a little. I have discontinued the tent in the hole where the ball entered, agreeable to his request.    he tells me that he is fully Convinced that the wound is sufficiently heeled for the tents to be discontinued.    we made 60 miles to day with the wind ahead greater part of the day—
