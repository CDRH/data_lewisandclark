Neither gives any explanation of the hiatus. Historian Doane Robinson has argued that the thermometer had been misplaced in packing and was found when the party dried and rearranged their baggage on September 16–17. Lewis's pre-expedition list of requirements includes three thermometers. This seems a small number for such an enterprise, but it appears unlikely that they could lose all three for four months, and the single August 25 reading disproves the theory. Robinson, 557; Lewis List of Requirements, Jackson (LLC), 1:69, 75 n. 1. The table and remarks here follow Lewis's observations in his Weather Diary, with a few variations in Clark Codex C remarks being noted. Neither recorded any information about the rise or fall of the river during the month, Lewis not even leaving a space for such observations in his table. See Weather Diary, January 1804, for further notes on the keeping of these weather tables.Lewis's remarks in his Weather Diary were placed beside his tabled daily entries; Clark's remarks in Codex C are on a separate page from his table. The two agree in substance, but a few variations by Clark are noted. The dates are Clark's, except on September 25; Clark repeats Lewis's note of that day on September 26.Perhaps the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica [AOU, 613]. Holmgren, 33.Perhaps the stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus [AOU, 233], or the pectoral sandpiper, C. melanotos [AOU, 239]. Ibid.There are only two species of gulls likely to be on the upper Missouri: the herring gull, Larus argentatus [AOU, 51], and the ring-billed gull, L. delawarensis [AOU, 54]; both have black wingtips. Ibid., 30.Clark, at the start of the entry, adds, "lost our Anchor last night."Clark says, "The 2d Cheif came and offered women." See his Field Notes entry for this date.Clark says, "Passed 60 Lodges of Tetons."Clark's September remarks in Codex C, from September 22 on, have been crossed out.
