He assisted the preparations for the Lewis and Clark expedition in various ways, and several men from his company were detailed to accompany the captains. He was promoted to major in 1807 and died of wounds received fighting the British at Fort Meigs, Ohio, in 1813. He was the author of Sketches, Historical and Descriptive, of Louisiana (Philadelphia, 1812). Heitman, 619; Osgood (FN), xxiv–xxvii.
