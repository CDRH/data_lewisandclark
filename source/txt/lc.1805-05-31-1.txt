trees which are now in leaf.—3rdhard frost last night.    at four P. M. the snow has not yet entirely
disappeared.—    the new horns of the Elk begin to appear.4ththe black martin makes it's appearance.    the snow has disap-

the Antelope and deer as yet have not.—    the small species of
Goatsucker or whiperwill begin to cry—    the blackbirds both
small and large have appeared.    we have had scarcely any thun-
der and lightning.    the clouds are generally white and accom-
panyed with wind only18tha good shower    saw the wild rose in blume.    the brown thrush
or mocking bird has appeared.—    had a good shower of rain
 today, it continued about 2 hours; this is the first shower that
deserves the appellation of rain, which we have seen since we leftFort Mandan.—    no thunder or lightning19thheavy fog this morning on the river22cdthe wind excessively hard all night—    saw some particles of snow

three of the bighorned antelopes.26thThe last night was much the warmest we have experienced, found
the covering of one blanket sufficient.    the air is extreemly dry
and pure.27thwind so hard we are unable to proceed in the early part of the
day28tha slight thundershower; the air was turbid in the forenoon and
appeared to be filled with smoke; we supposed it to proceed
from the burning of the plains, which we are informed are fre-
quently set on fire by the Snake Indians to compell the antelopes
to resort to the woody and mountanous country which they in-
habit.—    saw a small white and black woodpecker with a red
head; the same which is common to the Atlantic states.—29thrained but little, some dew this morning.30ththe rain commenced about 4 Oclock in the evening, and con-
tinued moderately through the course of the night; more rain
has now fallen than we have experienced since the 15th of Sep-
tember last.31stbut little rain    The Antelope now bring forth their young.    from
the size of the young of the bighorned Antelope I suppose they
bring forth their young as early at least as the Elk.This weather table follows Lewis's in his Codex Fe, with discrepancies between it and Clark's table in Codex I being noted. The tables are accompanied in each case by remarks in both the margins of the tables and separately.The remarks are found in the margins of the weather tables and in separate sections
following the tables of Lewis's Codex Fe and Clark's Codex I. We follow Lewis, with notes to significant differences with Clark's remarks.Perhaps Eritettix simplex.The English name for a similar Eurasian species was given to the mourning dove,
Zenaida macroura [AOU, 316], long before Lewis and Clark's time. Holmgren, 34; Burroughs, 234.The common poorwill, Phalaenoptilus nuttallii [AOU, 418], described by Lewis on October 16, 1804.The large blackbird is probably the common grackle, Quiscalus quiscula [AOU, 511], while the small blackbird could be the rusty blackbird, Euphagus carolinus [AOU, 509],
and/or Brewer's blackbird, E. cyanocephalus [AOU, 510]. If the latter, then Lewis was its discoverer. Holmgren, 28; Cutright (LCPN), 167–68.Brown thrush and brown mockingbird are old names for the brown thrasher, Toxostoma rufum [AOU, 705]. Holmgren, 34.Either Fragaria virginiana Duchn. var. glauca Wats., wild strawberry, or F. vesca L. var. americana Porter, woodland strawberry, although the former is more common in the area. Barkley, 140–41; Booth & Wright, 112.Perhaps the eastern kingbird, Tyrannus tyrannus [AOU, 444]. Holmgren, 28. See also June 10, 1805.The red-headed woodpecker, Malanerpes erythrocephalus [AOU, 406].
