The island of Mackinac, or Mackinaw, now part of Michigan and situated in the strait of the same name between Lakes Michigan and Huron, was long a center of the fur trade, and a French, British, and finally American military post. The original form of the name, Michilimackinac, meaning "place of the big wounded person," was derived from "Mishinimaki" (or "Mishinimakinagog"), the name of a supposed extinct Algonquian tribe. Hodge, 1:857.
