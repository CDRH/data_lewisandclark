an answer and some cornLewis's weather observations for this month are in his Weather Diary and are followed here; some significant variations in Clark's version in Codex C are noted. As in September, neither noted the rise or fall of the river.Clark gives the 4:00 p. m. wind direction for October 2 and 3 as "N."The remarks are from Lewis's Weather Diary, with substantial variations in Clark's Codex C noted.Clark says they came to at "a trading house of 3 french men."Probably the blue-winged teal, first mentioned on September 13, 1804; the mallard, which the captains frequently called the "duckinmallard," is Anas platyrhynchos [AOU, 132]. Holmgren, 30, 32, 33.Most of Clark's remarks for October 8 to 31 appear to have been crossed out, though it is not always clear which were intended to be marked out and which not.Clark placed these observations about plants under October 14. The "red burries" are the buffaloberry.Clark added, "& to be Discharged."The snow goose. Holmgren, 28, 30.Here again is a mistranslation of the name of the Cheyenne River.Viburnum lentago L., nannyberry. This more northerly species is different from the "black haws" found on the lower Missouri River (V. prunifolium L. and V. rufidulum Raf.). See June 19, 1804. All three species have similar leaves and black fruits. Barkley, 329–30; Fernald, 1340.Clark notes the depth of snow on October 21.Clark says the Sioux came "on the L. S. with their guns cocked."Lewis left out the word "camp," which Clark included.Clark adds, "maney of the Indians of different villages visit us."Clark's version reads, "Examoned the Country in advance for Several Leagues for a place for winter encampment without finding a Spot Calculated for one."
