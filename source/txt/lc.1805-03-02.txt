Simon McTavish came to America from Inverness-shire, Scotland, before 1772, and was a fur trader in Albany, New York, moving to Montreal in 1775. He was one of the original partners of the North West Company in 1779, becoming head of the company "in fact, if not in name," and perhaps the richest man in Montreal. The X Y, or New North West Company was founded in part by North West men who broke with the old company in 1798–1800, because of disagreement with McTavish's policies. His death in 1804 apparently made the merger of the two firms possible. Wallace, 15–17, 485–86; Davidson, 69–91, passim.Persimmon, Diospyros virginiana L.
