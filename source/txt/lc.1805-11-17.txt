a fair cool morning wind from the East. The tide rises at this place 8 feet 6 inches and comes in with great waves brakeing on the Sand beech on which we lay with great fury    Six hunters out this morning in serch of Deer & fowl.
At half past 1 oClock Capt Lewis returned haveing travesed Haleys Bay to Cape Disapointment and the Sea Coast to the North for Some distance. Several Chinnook Indians followed Capt L—    and a Canoe came up with roots mats &c. to Sell.    those Chinnooks made us a present of a rute boiled much resembling the common liquorice in taste and Size: [ML?: thy call cul-wha-mo]    in return for this root we gave more than double the value to Satisfy their craveing dispostn. It is a bad practice to receive a present from those Indians as they are never Satisfied for that they reive in return if ten time the value of the articles they gave. This Chin nook Nation is about 400 Souls inhabid the Countrey on the Small rivrs which run into the bay below us and on the Ponds to the N W of us, live principally on fish and roots, they are well armed with fusees and Sometimes kill Elk Deer and fowl.    our hunters killed to day 3 Deer, 4 brant and 2 Ducks, and inform me they Saw Some Elk Sign. I directed all the men who wished to See more of the main Ocian to prepare themselves to Set out with me early on tomorrow morning.

Sunday 17th Nov. 1805.    a clear morning    Several of the party went out a hunting, and Several more for meat.    in the after part of the day the hunters returned to Camp    had killed two Deer and Several geese and brants &C. Capt. Lewis and party returned to Camp also, and informed us that they had been about 30 miles down which took them on the Sea Shore and a verry bad road the most of the way.    they Saw the harbour where the vessells had lain but they were all gone.—


GassSunday 17th.    We had a fine pleasant clear morning, and 6 hunters went out. About noon they all came in; but the hunter who remained out last night, did not return. He had killed 2 deer, and the other men brought them 
in with some brants and a deer they had killed. About the same time Capt. Lewis, and his party returned. They had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer: but they had all sailed away.Captain Lewis and his party killed a deer and some brants. In the evening the remaining hunter came in and had killed another deer.
There are but few Indians settled down about the seashore; their dress is similar to that of some of those above. The women have a kind of fringe petticoats, made of filaments or tassels of the white cedar bark wrought with a string at the upper part, which tied round the waist. These tassels or fringe are of some use as a covering, while the ladies are standing erect and the weather calm; but in any other position, or when the wind blows, their charms have but a precarious defence.
A number of both sexes keep about our camp; some have robes made of muskrat skins sewed together, and I saw some of loon-skins. Their diet is chiefly fish and roots.MemorandumOf the computed distance in miles to the furthest point of

Sunday Novemr 17th    This morning we had clear pleasant weather.    several of our hunters went out to hunt, and took with them, some of the party to help bring in the Game that they might kill to our Camp.    In the afternoon the hunters all returned to Camp.    They had killed 2 Deer, and a number of Brants & Ducks, which they, & the Men that went with them brought to us.    In the Evening Captain Lewis, & the Men that was out with him also returned.    They informed us, that they had been about 30 Miles down on the Sea Coast, & that they had seen no white people or Vessells.    They learnt from the Indians along the Coast that some white people & Vessells had been lately there but that they were all gone.    Captain Clark concluded to go down with a party tomorrow to the Ocean in order to make his obsersvations of the Coast &ca.



Seashore lupine, Lupinus littoralis Dougl., whose underground rhizome was prepared for eating by Chinook Indians after roasting and pounding it. The common liquorice used for comparison is the cultivated Glycyrrhiza glabra L. Hitchcock et al., 3:319; Gunther (EWW), 38; Ray (LCEN), 119; Bailey, 561. It is the "cul-wha-mo" of the day's second entry, from Chinookanqalxwima for the lupine. Gibbs (AVC), 14. See Clark's entry of January 22, 1806 (apparently copied from Lewis's entry of January 24), for an extended discussion of the plant.Evidently Comcomly (Qanqḿli), a one-eyed chief of whom there is written mention from 1795. He was an important figure on the lower Columbia, a shrewd businessman and diplomat who eventually came to dominate the Chinooks. He was generally friendly with the whites, which enhanced his business and political interests. He was on good terms with the Astorians when they established their post in the area in 1811, and at first urged them to resist the British takeover in 1812, offering the assistance of his warriors. When the British seized the fort, however, he adroitly became their friend and ally. He remained the dominant figure of the Columbia mouth until his death in about 1829 or 1830, of a disease imported by the whites.

There is no known account of this reconnaissance.Lewis has left no known account of this reconnaissance, but his party clearly reached the Pacific Coast near Cape Disappointment and went up the coast some miles in Pacific County, Washington.The people immediately at the river mouth on the north side were Chinooks, who have given their name to the Chinookan language.Perhaps the robes, noted by the captains, of the skins of the mountain beaver, Aplodontia rufa, the captains' sewelel, a rodent but not a beaver. See Clark's entry of November 21, 1805. Otherwise, the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus.Perhaps the pacific loon, Gavia arctica pacifica, the western subspecies of the arctic loon, or the common loon, G. immer.McKeehan here offers a table of distances similar to, but much briefer than those the captains included at various places in their journals.
