A collection of miscellaneous material probably written at various time is squeezed in above the August 16, 1804, entry in the Field Notes (document 43). Some of it clearly belongs to the period at the "Fishing Camp."The "Wattesoons," a group of many names, were the Awaxawi, a division of the Minitari, or Hidatsa, people (see October 27, 1804).The spelling of the original is by no means clear, but the location of this tribe relative to the Mandans and "Wattesoons" leaves no doubt that Clark meant some variation of "Minitari" (Hidatsa).Gass may have been with this party, though his reference is unclear.The "Rock" may be the white or rock bass, Morone chrysops. It is difficult to identify Clark's "flat Back." Criswell suggests it was sometimes a synomym for a sucker (family Catostomidae), but this does not seem likely; perhaps Pylodictis olivaris, flathead catfish. The silverfish may the same as those mentioned on August 15 or they may be minnows. Lee et al., 574, 742; Criswell, 39, 83.The figures below come immediately after the August 16 entry in the Field Notes.In Codex B, the first two words of the interlined passage and the words "8 Salmon" were later crossed out, perhaps by Biddle in 1810.Northern pike, Esox lucius.
