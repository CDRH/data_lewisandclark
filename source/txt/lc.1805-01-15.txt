between 12 & 3 oClock this morning we had a total eclips of the moon, a part of the observations necessary for our purpose in this eclips we got which is at 12h 57m 54s    Total Darkness of the moon    @ 1 44 00    End of total Darkness of This moon    @ 2 39 10    End of the eclips—
This morning not So Cold as yesterday    wind from the S. E.    wind choped around to the N W.    Still temperate    four Considerate men of the Minetarre Came to See us    we Smoked in the pipe, maney mands. [Mandans] present also, we Showed [NB: attentions] to those men who had been impressed with an unfavourable oppinion of us. [NB: which satisfied them]

Observed equal Altitudes of the ☉ with sextant and Glass artifical horizon adjusted with a sperit level hms  hmsA. M.82632     P. M.——— "2914  ——— "32  1   14946
Altitude given by the sextant at the time of obtn.    26° 6' 15" hm  sChronomerter too slow on mean time—1157.7
Chronometer's daily rate of going, as deduced from this observation, and that of the 22nd of December 1804 is too slow on mean time    s 55.8☞ I do not place much confidence in this observation in consequence of loosing the observation of the Altitude of the ☉'s L. L. and center P. M. and that his U. L. was somewhat obscured by a cloud.    the weather was so could that I could not use water as the reflecting surface, and I was obliged to remove my glass horizon from it's first adjustment lest the savages should pilfer it.

The captains discussed their observations with Larocque on January 30. As he recalled it, they asserted that David Thompson had placed the Mandan and Hidatsa villages much too far west on his 1798 map, and that they had now corrected this by their observations of the eclipse. In fact, Thompson's longitude for the villages (101° 14' 24" W. for Matootonha) is relatively close to the actual position (101° 27' W.). The captains' observation from the eclipse gave a position about two degrees east of the true one (99° 26' 45" W.). However, Lewis actually did not place too much confidence in some of these observations, because of the slowness of the chronometer and meteorological difficulties. On Clark'sFort Mandan map (Atlas maps 32a, 32b, and 32c), the villages appear west of 101° W. longitude. Since the captains had a version of Thompson's map, they may have abandoned their own observations, in which they had less confidence than Larocque suggests, and followed Thompson. Larocque may have misunderstood what he was told. Wood & Thiessen, 151–52; Allen, 87–93, 117 n. 19, 142, 162; Thompson, 179; Nicholas Biddle to John Vaughn, [ca.
