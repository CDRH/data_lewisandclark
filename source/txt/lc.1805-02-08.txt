February 8, 1805Lewis8th February Friday 1805.
This morning was fair wind S. E.    the weather still warm and pleasent—    visited by the black-Cat the principal chief of the Roop-tar-he, or upper mandane vilage.    this man possesses more integrety, firmness, inteligence and perspicuety of mind than any indian I have met with in this quarter, and I think with a little management he may be made a usefull agent in furthering the views of our government. The black Cat presented me with a bow and apologized for not having completed the shield he had promised alledging that the weather had been too could to permit his making it, I gave him som small shot 6 fishing-hooks and 2 yards of ribbon    his squaw also presented me with 2 pair of mockersons for which in return I gave a small lookingglass and a couples of nedles.    the chief dined with me and left me in the evening.    he informed me that his people suffered very much for the article of meat, and that he had not himself tasted any for several days.—
