Among the <em class="hi">Grasses</em> of this Country I observe a large Species which grows in moist Situations; it rises to the hight of Eight or ten feet, the Culm is jointed, hollow, Smooth, as large as a goose quill, and more firm than ordinary grass; the leaf is linner broad and rough; it has much the appearance of the Meadin Cain as it is Called in the Southern parts of the U' States, and retains it's virdue untill late in the fall.    this grass propegates principally by the Root which is horozontal and perennial.—.    a Second Species grows in tussucks and rises to the hight of Six or Eight feet; it Seams to delight in the Soil of the river bottoms which possess agreater mixture of Sand than the hills in this neighbourhood.    this is also a harsh Course grass; it appears to be the Same which is Called the Corn grass in the Southern States, and the Foxtail in <a class="regularization" title="Virginia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Virginia">Virginia</a>.    a third Species resembles the cheet, tho' the horses feed on it very freely.    a fouth and most prevalent Species is a grass which appears to be the Same Called the blue Grass common to maney parts of the United States; it is common to the bottoms as well as the uplands, is now Seeding and is from 9 inches to 2 feet high; it affords an excellent paterage for horses and appears to bear the frost and Snow better than any grass in our Country; I therefore regrete very much that the Seed will not be ripe before our probable departure.    this is a fine Soft grass and would no doubt make excellent hay if cultivated. I do not find the Green Sword here which we met with on the lower part of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>. There are also Several Species of the wild Rye to be met with in the praries.    among the plants and Shrubs common to our Country I observe here the Seven bark, Wild rose, vineing honey suckle, Sweet willow, red willow, long leafed pine, Cattail or Coopers Flag. Lambs quarter, Strawberries, Raspberries, Goose berries, tongue grass, Mustard, tanzy, Sinquefield, horse mint, water penerial, <a href="#n35060518" id="ln35060518" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> elder, Coalts foot, Green Plantin, canser weed, Shoemate, 〈red black &amp; yellow Currents〉 and Several of the pea blume flowering plants.—. <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazier</a> who had permission to visit the <a class="regularization" title="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29">Twisted Hairs</a> Lodge at the distance of ten or twelve miles did not return this evening—.

Thursday 5th June 1806.    a fair morning.
