This morning early we dispatched <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Sergt.

Pryar</a> returned in the evening and reported that he had ascended the river six miles; that above the point at which it divides itself into two channels it is about 300 yds wide tho' the channel is not more than 50 yds and only 6 ft deep.    this is a large vollume of water to collect in so short a distance; I therefore think it probable that there are some large creeks falling into it from the S. W. the bed of this stream is formed entirely of quicksand; it's banks are low and at preasent overflows.    the water is turbid and current rapid.— the following are the courses taken by <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Sergt. Pryor</a>. S. 10° W. 1 M. to a point on the Lard. side passing a large Island on Stard. S. 24° E. 2 m. to the head of an Island near the Lard. shore S 33° E. 4 m. to a stard. point passing several islands on the Lard. side and a creek 50 yds. wide on Stard at 1 ½ miles.    the river from hence appeared to bend to the East.    he heard falls of water.    several different tribes informed us that it heads at <a class="regularization" title="Mount Hood (Timm, Falls Mountain)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mount%20Hood%20%28Timm%2C%20Falls%20Mountain%29">Mount Hood</a>. We were visited by several canoes of natives in the course of the day; most of whom were decending the river with their women and children.    they informed us that they resided at the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29">great rapids</a> and that their relations at that place were much streightened at that place for the want of food; that they had consumed their winter store of dryed fish and that those of the present season had not yet arrived. I could not learn wheather they took the Sturgeon but presume if they do it is in but small quantities as they complained much of the scarcity of food among them.    they informed us that the nations above them were in the same situation &amp; that they did not expect the Salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon which happens on the 2d of May. <a href="#n31040104" id="ln31040104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>    we did not doubt the varacity of these people who seemed to be on their way with their families and effects in surch of subsistence which they find it easy to procure in this fertile valley.—    This information gave us much uneasiness with rispect to our future means of subsistence.    above falls or through plains from thence to the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> there are no deer Antelope <a href="#n31040105" id="ln31040105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> nor Elk on which we can depend for subsistence; their horses are very poor most probably at this season, and if they have no fish their dogs must be in the same situation.    under these circumstances there seems to be but a gloomy prospect for subsistence on any terms; we therefore took it into serious consideration what measures we were to pursue on this occasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to wait the arrival of the salmon as that would detain us so large a portion of the season that it is probable we should not reach the United States before the ice would close the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>; or at all events would hazard our horses which we lelft in charge of the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a>

M. the hunters who were sent over the river returned having killed 4 Elk and two deer; the Elk were in good order but the deer extreemly poor.    they informed us that game is very plenty in that quarter.    the hunters on this side of the river also returned but had killed nothing; they saw a few Elk and deer.    there was also much sign of the black bear <a href="#n31040108" id="ln31040108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> seen on the other side of the river.    we sent a party to bring in the flesh of the Elk and deer that were killed.    they did not return this evening.
