One of our hunters had remained out all night, at noon we halted and they all came in, having killed an elk and a deer. At 2 we proceeded on again, and had a cold, wet and disagreeable afternoon, but our road or way was level along the valley.

places appear to lay thick.    one of our hunters found &amp; caught 2 horses and a handsom Colt.    we take them along with us though the horses are lame.    we expect that to be the reason that the natives left them in these bottoms.    we travveled 20 odd miles this day and Camped at the Creek and Smooth bottom where was fine feed for our horses.    our hunters all joined us    one of them had killed a Deer.    crossed Several branches in course of the day.—</p>

Sunday Septemr. 8th    A cold chilly Cloudy morning.    We set out early and proceeded on our Journey.—    We went down this large Creek or small River, we passed over smooth dry plains, but no timber to be seen excepting what grew along the Creek, which were large Pitch Pine trees.—    The bottom land along this large Creek were wide &amp; the Soil very rich.—    We crossed several small Creeks, which made into the large Creek which we left this morning.—    We saw Snow lying on Mountains, which lay to the South of us, &amp; high Barren hills, which lay to the North likewise of us.—    About 11 o'Clock A. M. we halted to dine at a Creek.—    Our hunters all joined us here, they had killed an Elk &amp; one Deer, which they brought to us.    The 
Wind has been from the N West during this day &amp; the Air chilly &amp; Cold.—    The Snow still continues on the Mountains, a small distance to the South of us.    We delayed about 2 hours to let our horses feed, we then proceeded on down the Valley &amp; had several small showers of rain accompanied with hail.—    We passed over level smooth plains in this Valley, the Mountains on each side of which, are rough, and are cover'd with Pine Trees, the Tops of which are Covered with Snow &amp; the snow appears to lay thick in many places on these Mountains.—    One of our hunters came across 2 Strange horses &amp; a Colt, which he caught.—    We took those horses &amp; Colt along with us, the horses were lame &amp; we expected that the Natives had left them in this Valley, on that account.    We came 25 Miles this day as near as we can guess, and encamped at a Creek, on a smooth bottom of land.    We found here fine food for our horses.    Our hunters joined us in the Evening.    They had killed only one deer which they brought to us.—
