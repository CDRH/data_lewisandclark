Two of our perogues have been lately injured very much in consequence of the tide leaving them partially on shore.    they split by this means with their own weight.    we had them drawn out on shore.    our convalessents are slowly on the recovery. <a class="regularization" title="Lepage, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lepage%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Lapage</a> is taken sick, gave him a doze of <a class="regularization" title="Scott, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Scott%2C%20Hugh">Scots</a> pills which did not operate.    no movement of the party today worthy of notice.    every thing moves on in the old way and we are counting the days which seperate us from the 1st of April and which bind us to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">fort Clatsop</a>.— The large black and white pheasant <a href="#n28030301" id="ln28030301" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is peculiar to that portion of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountain</a> watered by the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia river</a>.    at least we did not see them in these mountains until I we reached the waters of that river nor since we have left those mountains.    they are about the size of a well grown hen.    the contour of the bird is much that of the redish brown pheasant common to our country.    the tail is proportionably as long and is composed of eighteen feathers of equal length, of an uniform dark brown tiped with black.    the feathers of the body are of a dark brown black and white.    the black is that which most predominates, and wh[i]te feathers are irregularly intermixed with those of the black and dark brown on every part, but in greater proportion about the neck breast and belley.    this mixture gives it very much the appearance of that kind of dunghill fowl which the hen-wives of our country call <span class="italic">dommanicker.</span>    in the brest of some of these birds the white predominates most.    they are not furnished with tufts of long feathers on the neck as our pheasants are, but have a space on each side of the neck about 2½ inches long and 1 In. in width on which no feathers grow, tho' tis concealed by the feathers which are inserted on the hinder and front part of the neck; this space seems to surve them to dilate or contract the feathers of the neck with more ease.    the eye is dark, the beak black, curved somewhat pointed and upper exceeds the under chap.    they have a narrow stripe of vermillion colour above each eye which consists of a fleshy substance not protuberant but uneven with a number of minute rounded dots.    it has four toes on each foot of which three are in front. it is booted to the toes.    it feeds on wild fruits, particularly the berry of the sac-a-commis, and much also on the seed of the pine and fir.—</p>
