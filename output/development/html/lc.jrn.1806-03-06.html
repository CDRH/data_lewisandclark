Thursday 6th—    Our stock of provisions being nearly exhuasted, six men were sent out in different directions to hunt, and three more were sent to endeavour to procure some fish, as the natives take a great number of the small fish about 20 miles distant from the fort by water. Some men were also employed in repairing the canoes, that we may be able to set out on our return immediately, should our hunters be unsuccessful. The elk, almost the only game in this part of the country, are chiefly gone to the mountains. This day continued fair throughout.
