There are black elder and bore-tree, <a href="#n22091414" id="ln22091414" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> pitch and spruce pine all growing together on these mountains.

Saturday Septemr 14th    A Cloudy Morning, &amp; we did not set out till we had breakfasted, at which we eat the last of our Meat; we then proceeded on our Journey, and ascended a Mountain which was cover'd with Pine timber, and was about 4 Miles from where it began to ascend to the top; we descended this mountain; &amp; came down to a Creek on a fork of it; at this place the Water run rapid, &amp; it was very full of Rocks.—    We ascended then, another Mountain; which was about 4 Miles from the fork we left to the top of it.—</p>
               <p>
We continued on our way on the top of this mountain where we had a most delightful prospect of the Hills &amp; Vallies which lay below us, &amp; then descended this Mountain about 6 Miles, which in some places, we found very steep, and came down on another fork of the Creek, which we last left, which was considerable larger, the Natives had here made places across this fork of the Creek, in the form of Weirs to catch fish in, which we found in 2 different parts of this fork, it was worked in with willows very ingeniously &amp; strong, the current running very rapid at where these Weirs were set.—    We crossed below this place at where the Creek forked, and proceeded on down the creek and passed several Indian encampments, which the Natives had lately left.    Our guide informed us, that the Natives catch great Quantities of Salmon at this place, We went down this Creek about 4 Miles &amp; encamped.    the Men here eat a little portable Soup, but still are all very hungry.—    Our officers concluded on having a fine Colt that we had along with us killed, 
which was done, &amp; hunger made us all think that it eat delecious, We had towards Evening several small Showers of rain, some hail &amp; several severe Claps of thunder, The hunters that went after <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis's</a> horse &amp; the Colt, joined us in the Evening; they had found the horse only, We saw in the
