Wednesday 23d January    We had a continuation of Snow the greater part of this day, on its leaving off, it continued Cold to the 30th Instant, all hands during this time were employed at work on the boat &amp; Pettyaugers to get them free from the Ice, and hawled Stones on a Sled which they made warm in a fire, in order to thaw the Ice from about the said Crafts, when the Stones were put into the fire, they would not stand the heat of the fire but all of them broke, so that their labour was lost.
