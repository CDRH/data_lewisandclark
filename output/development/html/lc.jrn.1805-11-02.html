               <p>
We proceeded on about 4 Miles when the River that had been running rapid this day &amp; rough, became quite smooth &amp; gentle.    The River at this place is wide &amp; strait, &amp; remained so during the whole of this day.    We passed a creek which lay on the So. side of the River, &amp; a great number of springs &amp; Spring runs flowing from the Clifts &amp; mountains which lay high &amp; fell from off these Clifts &amp; Mountains upwards of 100 feet into the River.    The high Clifts &amp; rocks lies on both sides of the River.    The Indians that we had left at the 〈east〉 first fall (or rapid) overtook us with their Canoes, which they had carried below the big rapid.    We saw on board those Indians Canoes 2 of the Indian Men, who were dressed in Scarlet &amp; one of them dressed in blue Cloth all of which appeared to be new.    Those Indians had a Musket which the Stock was made of Brass &amp; Copper &amp; a Powder flask.—    Towards evening the River got rather wide, &amp; we could scarcely perceive any current running in the River.    The Clifts and mountains continued back a small distance from the River all this day.    We passed in the afternoon an Indian Village which lay on the South side of the River.    We also passed some high towers of Rocks &amp; Narrow bottoms of land which lay along the River on both sides of it.    The Country this day is Timbered land, the growth Spruce, Pine &amp; some Oaks; &amp; the soil very poor.    We saw this day in the River, Geese, Swans, Brants &amp; ducks.—    Some of our party shot 16 Geese, which we got.    We came 21 Miles this day, &amp; encamped under a shelving rock lying on the South side of the River, Our course Continuing West.—
