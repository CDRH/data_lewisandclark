Osgood argues that the notes on this large sheet could not have been made in the field, but were copied from earlier notes now lost, which he believes true of the Field Notes after <a href="lc.jrn.1804-09-23">September 23, 1804</a>. The notation at the top of the page, given here, appears to be in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> hand, and he could have added it at any time. The words "as first taken" could be interpreted as meaning that this document constitutes the original notes or that the sheet is an exact copy of the originals. Another notation, "to 24 Octo." (probably by <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a>) is just above the words "Set out" in the first entry.
