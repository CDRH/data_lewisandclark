Set out very early this morning and steered S. E. by E. about 4 Miles when we passed a bould runing creek about 12 yards wide the water could and remarkably clear, we then changed our course to S. E. passing obliquely across a valley which boar nearly E leaving the valley which we had pursued for the 2 precedeing days.    at the distance of 3 miles we passed a handsome little river which passes through this valley; it is about 30 yards wide affords a considerable quantity of water and I believe it may be navigated some miles.    I then changed my rout to S. W. passed a high plain which lyes between the vallies and returned to the S. valley, in passing which I fell in with a river about 45 yards wide which I waideg and then continued my rout down to it's junction with the river just mentioned, and from thence to the entrance of the creek which falls in about 2 miles below; still continuing my rout down this stream about three miles further and about 2 M. below our encampment of the last evening    this river forms a junction with a river 50 yards wide which comes from the N. W. and falling into the S. valley runs parrallel with the <a class="regularization" title="Madison River (Middle Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29">middle fork</a> about 12 miles.    this is a bould rappid &amp; clear stream it's bed so broken and obstructed by gravel bars and Islands that it appeared to me impossible to navigate it with safety.    the <a class="regularization" title="Madison River (Middle Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29">middle fork</a> is gentle and possesses about ⅔ds as much water as this rappid stream, it's cours so far as I can observe it is about S. W. and it appears to be navigable; its water is much warmer than that of the rappid fork and somewhat turbid, from which I concluded that it had it's source at a greater distance in the mountains and passed through an opener country than the other. <a href="#n18080401" id="ln18080401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    under this impression I wrote a note to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

Set out very early this morning and Steered S. E. by E. 4 M. when we pased a bold runing Creek 12 yds. wide, the water of which was clear and very cold.    it appears to be formed by four dranes from the snowey mountains to our left.    after passing this creek we changed our direction to S. E. passing obliquely across a valley which boar E leaving the valley we had pursued for the two peceeding days.    at the distance of 3 Ms. we passed a handsome little river which meanders through this valley; it is about 30 yds wide, affords a considerable quantity of water and appears as if it might be navigated some miles.    the currant is not rapid nor the water very clear; the banks are low and the bed formed of stone and gravel. <a href="#n18080403" id="ln18080403" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    I now changed my rout to S. W.    passed a high plain which lies betwen the valleies and returned to the South valley, in passing which I fell in with a river about 45 yds. wide gravley bottom gentle currant waist deep and water of a whitish blue tinge.    this stream we waded and continued our rout down it to the entrance of the river just mentioned about ¾ of a mile.    still continuing down we passed the entrance of the creek about 2 miles lower down; and at the distance of three miles further arrived at it's junction with a river 50 yds. wide which Comes from the S. W. and falling into the South valley runs parallel with the <a class="regularization" title="Madison River (Middle Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29">middle fork</a> about 12 miles before it forms a junction. I now found that our encampment of the last evening was about 1½ miles above the entrance of this large river on Stard.    this is a bold rappid and Clear Stream, it's bed so much broken and obstructed by gravley bars and it's waters so much subdivided by Islands that it appears to me utterly impossible to navigate it with safety. the <a class="regularization" title="Madison River (Middle Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29">middle fork</a> is gentle and possesses about ⅔rds as much water as this stream.    it's course so far as I can observe it is about S. W., and from the opening of the valley I beleive it still bears more to the West above    it may be safely navigated.    it's water is much warmer then the rapid fork and it's water more turbid; from which I conjecture that it has it's sources at a greater distance in the mountains and passes through an opener country than the other.    under this impression I wrote a note to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a>, recommending his taking the <a class="regularization" title="Madison River (Middle Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29">middle fork</a> povided he should arrive at this place before my return, which I expect will be the day after tomorrow.    this note I left on a pole at <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">the forks</a> of the river, and having refreshed ourselves and eat heartily of some venison which we killed this morning we continued our rout up the rapid fork on the Stard side, resolving to pursue this stream untill noon tomorrow and then pass over to the <a class="regularization" title="Madison River (Middle Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Madison%20River%20%28Middle%20Fork%29">middle fork</a> and come down it to their junction or untill I meet <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a>.
