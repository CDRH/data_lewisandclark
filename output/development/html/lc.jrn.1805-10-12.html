Saturday October 12th    We had a clear pleasant morning, &amp; we set out early &amp; proceeded on our Voyage down the River.    The Country has the same appearance as it had Yesterday.    we passed a number of old fishing 
Camps, lying along the Shores on both sides of the River, and found the current of the River run very swift in many places.    About 12 o'Clock A.
