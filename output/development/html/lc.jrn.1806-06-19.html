Our hunters were out very early this morning, they returned before noon with one deer only.    the Fishermen had been more unsuccessfull, they returned without a single fish and reported they could find but few and those they had tryed to take in vain.    they had broke both their giggs which were of indian fabrication made of bone. I happened to have a pointed peice of iron in my pouch which answered by cuting in two peices to renew boath giggs.    they took one fish this evening which proved to be a salmon trout much to our mortification, for we had hoped that they were the salmon of this spring arrival and of course fat and fine.    these trout are of the red kind they remain all winter in the upper parts of the rivers and creeks and are generally poor at this season.
