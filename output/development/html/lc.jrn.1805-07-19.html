The Musquetoes are very troublesome to us as usual.    this morning we set out early and proceeded on very well tho' the water appears to encrease in volocity as we advance.    the current has been strong all day and obstructed with some rapids, tho' these are but little broken by rocks and are perfectly safe.    the river deep and from 100 to 150 yds. wide. I walked along shore today and killed an Antelope.    whever we get a view of the lofty summits of the mountains the snow presents itself, altho' we are almost suffocated in this confined vally with heat.    the pine cedar and balsum fir <a href="#n17071901" id="ln17071901" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> grow on the mountains in irregular assemleages or spots mostly high up on their sides and summits.    this evening we entered much the most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen.    these clifts rise from the waters edge on either side perpendicularly to the hight of [<em class="hi">NB: about</em>] 1200 feet.    every object here wears a dark and gloomy aspect.    the tow[er]ing and projecting rocks in many places seem ready to tumble on us.    the river appears to have forced it's way through this immence body of solid rock for the distance of 5¾ miles and where it makes it's exit below has thrown on either side vast collumns of rocks mountains high.    the river appears to have woarn a passage just the width of it's channel or 150 yds.    it is deep from side to side nor is ther in the 1st 3 miles of this distance a spot except one of a few yards in extent on which a man could rest the soal of his foot.    several fine springs burst out at the waters edge from the interstices of the rocks.    it happens fortunately that altho' the current is strong it is not so much so but what it may be overcome with the oars for there is hear no possibility of using either the cord or Setting pole.    it was late in the evening before I entered this place and was obliged to continue my rout untill sometime after dark before I found a place sufficiently large to encamp my small party; at length such an one occurred on the lard. side where we found plenty of lightwood <a href="#n17071902" id="ln17071902" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and pichpine. this rock is a black grannite below and appears to be of a much lighter colour above and from the fragments I take it to be flint of a yelloish brown and light creemcolourd yellow.— <a href="#n17071903" id="ln17071903" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    from the singular appeaerance of this place I called it the <em class="hi">

M. which continued about an hour and was attended with som hail.    we have seen no buffaloe since we enterd the mounts.    this morning early <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

About 1 o'clock we had thunder, lightening and rain, which continued an hour or two, and then the weather became clear. This afternoon we passed parts of the mountains, that were very high, and mostly of solid rock of a light colour. The mountains are so close on the river on both sides that we scarcely could find room to encamp. We went 20 miles and 
encamped <a href="#n17071912" id="ln17071912" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> on the south side. After night some rain fell.

Friday July 19th    A Clear pleasant morning, We set out as usual, and proceeded on, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> &amp; one of the hunters walked along Shore, &amp; shortly killed a large Antelope.    We stopped, and took the Antelope on board of one of the Canoes.    We found that the current still run very strong 
against us, The Mountains appear'd very high as we passed them, and had Pine &amp; Balsam Fir trees growing on them, &amp; in some places they were very thick, We proceeded on 'till about 11 o'Clock, without breaking our fast, expecting to overtake <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> and the hunter, who were on shore, &amp; as we expected before us, but it not being the case, we are fearful of some accident having befel them—    We found the Otter plenty in the River, one of our party killed one of them with the Socket of his setting pole.—    We found beaver also tolerably plenty in the narrow bottoms of the River—    We proceeded on our way; at 12 o'Clock A.

               <p>
The bottoms on the points of land that lay along the River shore, is very narrow, The current of the River, run very strong the whole of this day, and the Water very Clear, we encamped in the Evening on the South side of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a>, having 19 Miles this day, shortly after we had encamped we had a light shower of Rain—
