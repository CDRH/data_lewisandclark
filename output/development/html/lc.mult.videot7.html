It's simply a good story it appeals to people because of its success. Lewis and Clark did the job set before them. They have this phrase in the journals: 'we proceeded on', and that reverberates through their journals. I think it means more than forward motion, 'we got from here to there each day.' I think it also has a sense about it that 'we went on in spite of whatever difficulties were in front of us.'
