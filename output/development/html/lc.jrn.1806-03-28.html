This morning we set out very early and at 9 A. M. arrived at the old Indian Village on Lard side of <a class="regularization" title="Deer (E-lal-lar) Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deer%20%28E-lal-lar%29%20Island">Deer Island</a>

M. it became fair, and we had the canoes which wanted repairing halled out and with the assistance of fires which we had kindled for the purpose dryed them sufficiently to receive the pitch which was immediately put on them; at 3 in the evening we had them compleat and again launched and reloaded.    we should have set out, but as some of the party whom we had permitted to hunt since we arrived have not yet returned we determined to remain this evening and dry our beding baggage &amp;c. the weather being fair.

                  <em class="hi">Friday 28th.</em>    The morning was cloudy. We set out early, and at 10 o'clock 
came to <a class="regularization" title="Deer (E-lal-lar) Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deer%20%28E-lal-lar%29%20Island">Deer island</a>; where those who had gone ahead in the small canoes had encamped, and all gone out to hunt except one. In a short time a hunter returned with a large deer, and we concluded to stay here all day and repair two of our canoes, that leaked. It rained at intervals during the day. Our hunters came in and had killed 7 deer in all. Some of the men went to bring in the meat, and others went out and killed some geese and ducks. At the last village we passed I took notice of a difference in the dress of the females, from that of those below, about the coast and <a class="regularization" title="Baker (Haley's) Bay" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Baker%20%28Haley%27s%29%20Bay">Hailey's Bay</a>. Instead of the short petticoat, they have a piece of thin dressed skin tied tight round their loins, with a narrow slip coming up between their thighs. On this island there are a greater number of snakes, than I had ever seen in any other place; they appeared almost as numerous as the blades of grass; and are a species of Garter snake. When our men went for the deer, they found that the fowls had devoured four of the carcases entirely, except the bones. So they brought in the other two; and we finished our canoes and put them in the water. The <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia river</a> is now very high, which makes it more difficult to ascend.
