We sent out several hunters early this morning with instructions to meet us at the lodge of the <a class="regularization" title="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29">Twisted hair</a>.

I have no doubt but this tract of country if cultivated would produce in great abundance every article essentially necessary to the comfort and subsistence of civillized man.    to it's present inhabitants nature seems to have dealt with a liberal hand, for she has distributed a great variety of esculent plants over the face of the country which furnish them a plentifull store of provision; these are acquired with but little toil, and when prepared after the method of the natives afford not only a nutricious but an agreeable food.    among other roots those called by them the Quawmash and Cows are esteemed the most agreeable and valuable as they are also the most abundant.    the cows is a knobbed root of an irregularly rounded form not unlike the Gensang <a href="#n34050905" id="ln34050905" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> in form and consistence.    this root they collect, rub of a thin black rhind which covers it and pounding it expose it in cakes to the sun.    these cakes ate about an inch and ¼ thick and 6 by 18 in width, when dryed they either eat this bread alone without any further preperation, or boil it and make a thick muselage; the latter is most common and much the most agreeable.    the flavor of this root is not very unlike the gensang.—    this root they collect as early as the snows disappear in the spring and continue to collect it untill the quawmash supplys it's place which happens about the latter end of June.    the quawmash is also collected for a few weaks after it first makes it's appearance in the spring, but when the scape <a href="#n34050906" id="ln34050906" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> appears it is no longer fit for use untill the seed are ripe which happens about the time just mentioned, and then the cows declines.    the latter is also frequently dryed in the sun and pounded afterwards and then used in making soope.—    I observed a few trees of the larch and a few small bushes of the balsam fir near the lodge of the <a class="regularization" title="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29">Twisted hair</a>.    at 2 P.
