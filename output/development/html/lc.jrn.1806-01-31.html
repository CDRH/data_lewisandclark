The beak is smoth, black, convex and cultrated; one and ⅛ inches from the point to the opening of the chaps and ¾ only uncovered with feathers; the upper chap exceeds the other a little in length.    a few small black hairs garnish the sides of the base of the upper chap.    the eye is of a uniform deep sea green or black, moderately large.    it's legs feet and tallons are white; the legs are an inch and a ¼ in length and smoth; four toes on each foot, of which that in front is the same length with the leg including the length of the tallon, which is 4 lines; <a href="#n28013103" id="ln28013103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the three remaining toes are ¾ of an inch, each armed with proportionably long tallons.    the toes are slightly imbricated.    the tallons are curved and sharply pointed.
