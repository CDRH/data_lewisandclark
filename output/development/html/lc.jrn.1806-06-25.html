last evening the indians entertained us with seting the fir trees on fire.    they have a great number of dry lims near their bodies which when set on fire creates a very suddon and immence blaze from bottom to top of those tall trees.    they are a beatifull object in this situation at night. this exhibition reminded me of a display of fireworks.    the natives told us that their object in seting those trees on fire was to bring fair weather for our journey.— We collected our horses readily and set out at an early hour this morning.    one of our guides complained of being unwell, a symptom which I did not much like as such complaints with an indian is generally the prelude to his abandoning any enterprize with which he is not well pleased.    we left them at our encampment and they promised to pursue us in a few hours.    at 11 A.
