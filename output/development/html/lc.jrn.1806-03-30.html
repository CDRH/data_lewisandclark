Sunday March 30th    We set out early this morning, &amp; proceeded on.    The River still continuing rising, and is so high, that the tide has no Effect, as high up the River as where we now are.    A number of the Indians accompanied us in their small Canoes.    We saw a considerable quantity of drift wood floating down the River.    We passed two large Indian Villages which were on a large island.    This island was very long and is called <a class="regularization" title="Sauvie (Wapato) Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Sauvie%20%28Wapato%29%20Island">Waptoe island</a>, it is about 25 Miles long, &amp; is partly Wood land &amp; the remainder Priari land, &amp; is very rich Soil.    A number of the Indians who resided on this Island, came out in their Canoes to see us.    We saw this day <a class="regularization" title="Mount Rainier" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mount%20Rainier">Mount Rainey</a>
