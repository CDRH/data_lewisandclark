         <p>New evidence reveals that the author of the 1797 Indian Office Map was <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span>, leader of the third Missouri Company expedition up the Missouri River. It probably was transmitted to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> when <span class="tei_name">MacKay </span>accepted a covert invitation by <span class="tei_name">Private Joseph Field</span> to visit Camp Dubois in 1804.</p>
         <p>Nueva evidencia revela que el autor del Mapa de la Officina de los Indios (Indian Office Map) de 1797 fue <span class="tei_name">James McKay</span>, lider de la tercera expedicion de la Comania de Missouri (Missouri Company) por el Rio de Missouri. Este mapa fue probablemente transmitido a <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> y <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> cuando<span class="tei_name"> McKay</span> acepto una invitació n secreta para visitar el Campamento Dubois hecha por el Soldado <span class="tei_name">(Private) Joseph Field</span> en 1804.</p>
         <p>Maps, no less than narratives, are among our most basic documents, and when they are examined carefully they shed great light on the time line of history and reveal the growth of knowledge as well as the progress of human endeavors. A history without maps is inconceivable.</p>
         <p>Thus, a crucial aspect in the planning of the single most important exploration in American history, that of <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson's</span> Corps of Discovery, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition, was to obtain reliable maps to chart their route.</p>
         <p>How did <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> do this?</p>
         <p>The answer to the captains' success in finding a viable map of the Upper Missouri River is to be found in the story of cartographer <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span>, a Scotsman who, based on his extensive trading with the Indians in Canada, and on his proficiency in map—making and experience in surveying, had been hired to lead the Spanish expedition up to the Missouri in Louisiana territory.</p>
         <p>A superficial look at history would indicate that <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> was only one small player in the international intrigue of land and economic disputes in the late–eighteenth and early–nineteenth centuries. It would suggest that the handwriting on the map, in both French and English, proved that <span class="tei_name">John Evans </span>(<span class="tei_name">MacKay's</span> field assistant) and <span class="tei_name">Nicolas De Finiels</span> (a Frenchman who assisted <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> and others in various cartographic efforts) contributed to the actual drawing of the map–which is now known as the Indian Office Map.</p>
         <p>But, a cursory look at history, as always, can be misleading. It is true that it was <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span> who, on that 1795 expedition, traveled the Upper Missouri River to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>, while <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> remained in Fort Charles–795 miles above St. Louis–and it is logical to think, since it was <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> who explored the Upper Missouri, that he would have been the one to draw the map. Also, there did exist at the time an international aspect of cooperation: <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>, <span class="tei_name">Antoine Soulard</span> (surveyor general of Upper Louisiana) and <span class="tei_name">De Finiels</span> all assisted one another on cartographic efforts. It is perhaps because of this, combined with <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>'s explorations on the Upper Missouri that historians have denied <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s role as the primary draftsman of the Missouri River map. The truth is to be found in detailed detective work.</p>
         <p>The story begins in the 1790s. At that time, Louisiana encompassed a huge swath of country west of the Mississippi, and distant European powers lacked the means to populate it or patrol its borders. (See Figure 1.) When Spain took control of the region in 1762, British traders in Canada had already begun establishing alliances with the various Indian nations along Louisiana's northern boundary. These alliances enabled the British to make deep forays into Spanish territory without fear of reprisal. It proved very difficult for Spain to wrest control from the British. Beginning in 1789, a few hunters, including <span class="tei_name">Juan Munier</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Garreau</span>, were the first Spanish to explore the Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Jacques D'Eglise</span> followed a year later. These men reported that the British had been stealing the trade from the Spanish and were underselling them in their own territory. Something had to be done and quickly: the Spanish would have to ascend the Missouri, establish relations with the Indian tribes, and somehow win them over from the British. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0101" id="lnlc.danisi.0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In 1791, Spain appointed as governor general of Louisiana the <span class="tei_name">Baron de Carondelet</span>. One of <span class="tei_name">Carondelet</span>'s first decrees was to throw open the trade to all subjects of <span class="tei_name">His Catholic Majesty, Carlos IV</span>. In that year, Spain learned that the British had established a trading alliance with the river tribes on the Upper Missouri, and, if war broke out, the Spanish would lose control of that river. While <span class="tei_name">Carondelet</span>'s decree offered advantages, the Indians had already become allied with the British and thus discouraged Spanish traders from going upriver. This development demanded a strategic plan and, in 1793, a group of St. Louis traders formed the "Company of Explorers of the Upper Missouri," pooling their resources to finance well—equipped expeditions. While the financing appeared to come easily, finding suitable persons to lead the expedition proved challenging. The first two expeditions, led by <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Truteau </span>and a man named <span class="tei_name">Lecuyer</span>, made little progress on the Missouri. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0102" id="lnlc.danisi.0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>  However, in choosing <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span> to lead the third expedition in 1795, the traders found a well—prepared and uniquely talented man.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> arrived in Canada some time in 1776–1777, and for the next five years his whereabouts are unknown. In 1783, the British traders <span class="tei_name">Holmes</span> and <span class="tei_name">Grant</span> hired him. <span class="tei_name">Robert Grant</span>, an experienced trader from Montreal associated with the North West Company took him to Grand Portage, the rendezvous for Canadian traders on the north shore of Lake Superior. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0103" id="lnlc.danisi.0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Two years later <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> was released to go to the Saskatchewan River as a clerk, but he was back on the Assiniboine River for the winter 1786–1787. On returning to <span class="tei_name">Grant</span> in 1787, he was given an opportunity to travel overland to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages on the Missouri River. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0104" id="lnlc.danisi.0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> That overland journey was usually made during the winter using dog trains to haul small outfits and bring back peltry and foodstuffs, especially corn. When his contract ended in 1788, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> went back to Montreal with the returning canoes. Relations with the Canadian traders soured, however, and he left for the United States, where he renewed association with his brother, <span class="tei_name">John</span>, in New York City, and began trading in the United States. In June 1789, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> met with <span class="tei_name">Don Diego Gardoqui</span>, the Spanish chargé  in New York City and presented him with a map, "a su modo" of the British—Canadian trade. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0105" id="lnlc.danisi.0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> started a fur—trading partnership with depots in Cahokia, Cincinnati, and New York City. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0106" id="lnlc.danisi.0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> He had arrived in Cahokia by September 1791 and established a name by 1793. On 20 May 1793, <span class="tei_name">Zenon Trudeau</span>, lieutenant governor of Upper Louisiana, wrote to <span class="tei_name">Baron de Carondelet</span>, governor general of Louisiana, that he hoped "to see within a few days a well informed Canadian mozo [young man]" who had been trading with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> nation. He hoped to obtain from him information on the British among those Indians. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0107" id="lnlc.danisi.0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jacques Clamorgan</span>, director of the St. Louis—based fur—trading Missouri Company, were so impressed with <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s abilities––to make maps, to write and speak the French language, and to trade with a variety of Indian tribes–that they hired him to head an expedition up the Missouri for the company. <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> then left Spanish Louisiana to conclude his business in New York and Cincinnati. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0108" id="lnlc.danisi.0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Two other notable men arrived in Spanish Louisiana at about the same time as <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>: <span class="tei_name">John Thomas Evans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Antoine Pierre Soulard</span>. <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> had come to the United States looking for a tribe of<span class="tei_name"> Welsh</span> Indians he thought might be the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. On 10 October 1792 he arrived in Baltimore, where he stayed and worked for various Welshmen. In March 1794, he departed by boat and landed in New Madrid [present—day Missouri] about two months later. Upon entering Spanish domains, he took the oath of allegiance that the commandant, <span class="tei_name">Thomas Porten</span>, forced on all newcomers. It appears that <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> contracted malaria and stayed with a Welsh couple in New Madrid before he continued on toward St. Louis. On the way to St. Louis, <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> became lost and finally turned up at a Spanish post opposite Kaskaskia, deranged from the summer heat. Fortunately, he met another Welshman, the lawyer <span class="tei_name">John Rice Jones</span>, who took care of him on the Illinois side of the river. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0109" id="lnlc.danisi.0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> A month later, <span class="tei_name">Jones</span> introduced him to a Cahokia merchant and court clerk, <span class="tei_name">William Arundel</span>. <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> stayed at <span class="tei_name">Arundel</span>'s home until Christmas 1794, when he learned about <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span>'s forthcoming expedition up the Missouri River and left for St. Louis, hoping to join. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0110" id="lnlc.danisi.0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> It was an inopportune time for <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> to go to St. Louis. War with Britain was imminent and explaining to <span class="tei_name">Zenon Trudeau</span>, the lieutenant governor, that he was on a quest to find a tribe of <span class="tei_name">Welsh</span> Indians must have sounded preposterous to the highest ranking official in Upper Louisiana. Suspicious of British spies entering Spanish country, <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> had <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> "[i]mprisoned, loaded with iron and put in the Stoks . . . in the dead of winter." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0111" id="lnlc.danisi.0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>A few months after<span class="tei_name"> Evans</span> was thrown in jail, in February 1794, <span class="tei_name">Antoine Soulard</span> arrived at Ste. Genevieve. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0112" id="lnlc.danisi.0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The commandant of New Bourbon, <span class="tei_name">Pierre Delassus de Luzié res</span>, knew <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> because he had deserted the naval service at Martinique, France, with one of <span class="tei_name">De Luzié res</span>'s sons. This son had told <span class="tei_name">De Luzié res</span> that the two had not wished to recognize the French Republic as their home and had decided to join the family in America. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0113" id="lnlc.danisi.0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The commandant of Ste. Genevieve had fears that Kentuckians might attack Louisiana. With no defenses in the village, <span class="tei_name">Soulard </span>volunteered to help and began "directing the works on the fort" according to the "plans and sketches" of a Flemish engineer, <span class="tei_name">Louis Vandenbenden</span>. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0114" id="lnlc.danisi.0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>The work was completed quickly, and <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> summoned <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> to St. Louis, who arrived there by 20 March. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0115" id="lnlc.danisi.0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>In August of that same year, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had gone to Cincinnati to conclude his partnership in his eastern business interests with <span class="tei_name">John Robertson</span>. While in Cincinnati, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> met with <span class="tei_name">John Rees</span>, or Rhys, a native of Wales, who told him of <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>'s quest for <span class="tei_name">Welsh</span> Indians and gave him a small dictionary of <span class="tei_name">Welsh</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> vocabulary. <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had been among the <span class="tei_name">Mandans </span>in 1787 but "had heard nothing of a <span class="tei_name">Welch</span> tribe. . . ." When <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> arrived in St. Louis a few weeks later, he "sent for, &amp;  engaged for [his] assistant <span class="tei_name">Mr. Evans</span> who spoke and wrote the Welch language with facility...." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0116" id="lnlc.danisi.0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, realizing that <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> could be an asset to the expedition, decided to employ him as his lieutenant and field operator.</p>
         <p>The story of the <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> map of the Missouri River begins when the first expedition for the Missouri Company, headed by <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Truteau</span>, a schoolmaster, left St. Louis on 7 June 1794. <span class="tei_name">Clamorgan</span> had provided <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> with a plan or idea so "that he may know his whereabouts." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0117" id="lnlc.danisi.0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The north half of this plan, taken directly from <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s travels in Canada in 1784 through 1788, was the first of its kind and gave a tactical view of where the British traders had encroached upon Spanish soil. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0118" id="lnlc.danisi.0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> When <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> first met <span class="tei_name">Zenon Trudeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jacques Clamorgan</span> in May 1793, he had shown them this "topographical idea of the Upper Mississippi and Missouri." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0119" id="lnlc.danisi.0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had met with <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> to help produce a map for <span class="tei_name">Carondelet</span>. <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> wrote to <span class="tei_name">Carondelet</span> on 24 November 1794, stating that he was remitting some maps drawn by <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> "among which was a map of the Missouri river." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0120" id="lnlc.danisi.0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span>'s admission of a <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> map is interesting; <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> could not have completed it by himself, because during the summer and autumn months that year he suffered bouts of "most violent fever" and "would have succumbed," except that <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> and his wife took care of him. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0121" id="lnlc.danisi.0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> In other words, being so ill, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span>, who had not been on the Upper Missouri River, could only have completed a map of the river with <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s assistance, because <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had visited the Upper Missouri River. Nonetheless, <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> recommended that <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> serve as the surveyor of Upper Louisiana, and in December, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> made a voyage to New Orleans where he was appointed surveyor general on 3 February 1795. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0122" id="lnlc.danisi.0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Between January and August 1795, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> began to survey land grants in St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, as well as drafting a large–scale map, "Ydea Topografica," of the Missouri River Basin. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0123" id="lnlc.danisi.0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> The original Spanish map is titled "A Topographical idea of the Upper Mississippi &amp;  Missouri that shows the progress of the Spanish Discovery of the Missouri river &amp;  the encroachments [or usurpations] of the English companies over the Spanish possessions." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0124" id="lnlc.danisi.0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The French copy attributes its drawing to <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> who completed it in August 1795, though <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> revised "Ydea Topografica" when he returned from his expedition in 1797. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0125" id="lnlc.danisi.0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> wrote on 15 December of that year that the map was "corrected by one of the voyagers of the company of discovery," and that he would soon present a map of the Missouri to <span class="tei_name">Gayoso de Lemos</span>, the new governor general of Louisiana, "much more correct than what I gave you earlier." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0126" id="lnlc.danisi.0126" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Charting a river requires at least two people: the surveyor and the draftsman. The surveyor takes measurements and sketches landmarks like islands, bends in the river, and large trees, recording the field notes in a book, while the draftsman draws a grid and translates the measurements from the field notes into a diagram that represents the river. In 1795, charting a river required taking detailed astronomical observations to determine longitude and latitude, the critical east and west directions. <span class="tei_name">William Dunbar</span>, who lived in Spanish Louisiana in the 1790s, had been hired by the Spanish as their astronomer. <span class="tei_name">Dunbar</span> had advanced the science of astronomical observation further than any of the prominent group of Philadelphian astronomers had during this period by "requiring neither assistant nor time–piece." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0127" id="lnlc.danisi.0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Dunbar</span> was able to reduce the complexity yet raise the bar for accuracy; however in 1795, <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span> knew only one method and, by hiring <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>, it presupposed that an assistant was mandatory. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0128" id="lnlc.danisi.0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Near the end of August 1795, the third expedition for the Missouri Company left St. Louis with a number of objectives: to make a map ascertaining the northern boundary of the province, since no chart had been drawn nor evidence collected that verified the northern extent of Louisiana; to establish forts along the Missouri River; to reach the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> in North Dakota; and to find a water route to the Pacific Ocean. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0129" id="lnlc.danisi.0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Governor Carondelet</span> was so pleased with the possibility of finding a water route that he offered a cash prize of 3000 piastres to the first Spanish subject who could penetrate to the Pacific Ocean via the Missouri River. He also promised to pay the salaries of one hundred men to guard the forts that <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> would build along the route of that river. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0130" id="lnlc.danisi.0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> How such a complex expedition with so few resources was to achieve its goal is a mystery, but<span class="tei_name"> MacKay</span>, having been assured that the Missouri Company was well financed, embarked upon the exploration.</p>
         <p>The expedition arrived at the <span class="tei_name">Omaha village</span> in Nebraska in mid—October and built Fort Charles, approximately twenty miles south of present—day Sioux City, Iowa. The <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> chief, <span class="tei_name">Blackbird</span>, had the reputation of being both difficult and tyrannical. He demanded daily communication with <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>. This meant that <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had to remain at the fort when<span class="tei_name"> Evans</span> left for the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> at the end of November. <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> realized that <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> would have to continue the survey of the river on his own, and so <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> taught <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> with precision and gave him a comprehensive list of instructions:</p>
         <p>You will keep a journal of each day and month of the year to avoid any error in the observations of the important journey which you are undertaking. In your journal you will place all that will be remarkable in the country that you will traverse; likewise the route, distance, latitude and longitude, when you observe it, also the winds and weather. You will also keep another journal in which you will make note of all the ... territory . . . lakes; rivers; mountains; portages, with their extent and location. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0131" id="lnlc.danisi.0131" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> also wrote about the accuracy of the observations:</p>
         <p>In your route from here to the home of the <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span>, trace out as exactly as possible a general route and distance from the Missouri as well as the rivers which fall into it; and although you cannot take the direction of each turn and current of the Missouri, since you go by land, you can mark the general course of the mountains which will be parallel to each bank. You will observe the same thing for every other river (landmark) which you may see during your journey, whether river, lake, ocean, or chain of mountains which may effect your observations. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0132" id="lnlc.danisi.0132" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, in effect, instructed <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> on how to take a detailed set of field notes so that when he received them, he could continue updating the map of the Missouri River. <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> also reminded <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> that if he ran out of ink to "use the powder, and for want of powder, in the summer you will surely find some fruit whose juice can replace both." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0133" id="lnlc.danisi.0133" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> Clearly, the man who needed such orders written down could not have been the author of the map.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> also gave <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> a supplemental set of instructions to ensure that <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>'s observations, regardless of the distance between them, remain accurate. He wrote, "As I mean to make Sunday (being a remarkable day) the day for observing the distance of the moon from the sun I wish you to do the same when convenient so that we may be the better able to compare them when you return." He treated <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> as a novice and his student. His instructions continued: "I will always make my observations when the sun is on the meridian which will of course give the just time of day. You may draw a meridian line by the north star if you should be a couple of days in one place &amp;  if the sky be clear at night if this cannot be you may take it by the compass if you know exactly the variation."

            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had sent a message to the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> before <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> left to notify them that an expedition was en route. A few weeks after <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> left Fort Charles, his party came upon a band of <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> who chased him for an entire day and were about to overtake him when night fell. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0135" id="lnlc.danisi.0135" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> returned to Fort Charles on 6 January 1796, although he left again on the twenty-eighth. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0136" id="lnlc.danisi.0136" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a> It took him two months to reach the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> village–traveling seven hundred miles by water and then spending an additional six weeks to talk the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> into letting him journey onward. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0137" id="lnlc.danisi.0137" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a> On 23 September, <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> arrived at the lower <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village, in present—day North Dakota, and found a fort built by the merchants of Montreal, that he named Fort Makay [<span class="tei_name">Evans</span>'s spelling]. Carrying a formal notice written by <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> ordered several British traders on 8 October to leave Spanish soil.

         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay </span>had suggested to <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> that he would make another map of the Missouri more detailed than the one being sent with <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span>. <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> wrote to <span class="tei_name">Gayoso</span> speaking about <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> and the maps, "He also has the intention [literally: ambition] of continuing to make another complete one, but the expenses will be too considerable to propose them to you.” <a href="#nlc.danisi.0144" id="lnlc.danisi.0144" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a> As <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> noted, the expenses would certainly have been prohibitive since the Missouri Company had expended all of its resources on the three expeditions. <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> departed in late March 1798 to meet <span class="tei_name">Gayoso</span> and talk with him about the success of the expedition. <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span>, after completing his work as a deputy surveyor, departed for New Orleans in the beginning of July.</p>
         <p>More evidence disputes that either <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> or <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> drafted the Missouri River map. In 1908, <span class="tei_name">Frederick Teggart</span> discussed an <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> map that came into the possession of <span class="tei_name">John Hay</span> and <span class="tei_name">William Henry Harrison</span>. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0145" id="lnlc.danisi.0145" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a> In late October 1797, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> had appointed <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> the deputy surveyor of Cape Girardeau and on 7 November, <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> had departed for the district with surveying instructions. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0146" id="lnlc.danisi.0146" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a> Sometime in May 1798, a flood devastated the district and <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> lost most of his belongings.

Events that were to thrust the map into the limelight began to converge: in January 1801, <span class="tei_name">Jones</span> was appointed attorney general of the Indiana Territory and moved to Vincennes, the capitol. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0149" id="lnlc.danisi.0149" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a> When <span class="tei_name">William Henry Harrison</span>, governor of the territory, was apprised of the expedition in 1803, <span class="tei_name">Jones</span> delivered the map to him. <span class="tei_name">Harrison</span> wrote to <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> on 13 November 1803, informing him that he had the map copied and "now send it to you by Post rider." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0150" id="lnlc.danisi.0150" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>

         <p>Before<span class="tei_name"> MacKay</span> went to New Orleans, <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> drafted a map for him. In fact, he and <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> assisted each other, which has not been fully understood because the dates of their map–making overlap. They both produced maps during 1797 and 1798:
<span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, from May to December 1797; <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>, from August 1797 to June 1798. <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> arrived in St. Louis on 3 June 1797. He had been hired in Philadelphia to oversee the building of defenses at St. Louis. But <span class="tei_name">Carlos Howard</span>, the military commandant, refused to employ him. <span class="tei_name">Howard</span> had no explicit order from <span class="tei_name">Carondelet</span> and believed that <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>, an artillerist engineer, was not as competent as <span class="tei_name">Louis Vandenbenden</span>, a fortifications engineer. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0153" id="lnlc.danisi.0153" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> decided to embark upon a private mapping project during 1797–1798.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> refers to a map completed in mid–1798. "La carte de cette Riviere que j'ai dressé e en 1798 sur les memoirs ds/des <span class="tei_name">Mess./Messieurs MacKay</span> et <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> donnera une notion tré s exacte de la partie de son tours que Pont peut regarder comme la mieux connue jusques apresant" ("The map of this river that I drew up in 1798 [based] upon the accounts of <span class="tei_name">Messieurs MacKay</span> and <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> will give a very exact notion/idea of its [the river's] course which one can regard as the best known up to the present"). <a href="#nlc.danisi.0154" id="lnlc.danisi.0154" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> map, which measures ten feet long and a yard wide, shows the Missouri River for more than eighty miles west of its mouth.</p>
         <p>This map is <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>'s greatest achievement, a colossal, unauthorized, and personal project: mapping the central Mississippi valley. His idea for it was likely due to <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s arrival from the Upper Missouri, replete with fresh data regarding the expedition and <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span>'s "Ydea Topografica," as well as the fact that <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> possessed the surveying measurements for many of the villages. In terms of artistry and accuracy of detail, <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>'s map of the central Mississippi valley stands apart from any other produced in the history of North America. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0155" id="lnlc.danisi.0155" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Even now, <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>'s hand translates an ancient time into a living one. The map details St. Louis, Carondelet, Prairie du Pont ("Prairie of the Bridge," now Dupo), Cahokia, River Des Peres, <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span>'s Pond, the Commonfields, Cape Girardeau, Ste. Genevieve, and New Madrid. Tiny red squares represent houses, and he depicts each field under cultivation, the hills, and the green—tinted Mississippi River. The breadth and majesty of this map argue for the amount of time and concentration <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> took to complete it.</p>
         <p>The time necessary to complete this map precludes the idea that <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> could have also drafted a Missouri River map laden with all the complexities of a course of 1510 miles. But surprisingly, <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> describes another map that he drafted in 1797 near the Bon Homme Creek on the Missouri River. From the French manuscript of "Notice sur la Louisiane Supé rieure" ("An Account of Upper Louisiana"), <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> states that he made a map for <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>–not the Missouri Company: "C'est sur ses memoires et sur ses relevé s que j'ai dressé  pour lui en 1797 la derniere carte du Missouri." ("It is upon his written statement &amp; upon his account that I drew up for him in 1797 the latest map of the Missouri.") <a href="#nlc.danisi.0156" id="lnlc.danisi.0156" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name"> Finiels</span> attempts to make a distinction between <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s Missouri River map (a version of the Indian Office map) and the one that he drafted for <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> that was of an unnamed district; thus the appellation "latest map of the Missouri." The map is titled "Plan ideal de las habitaciones del riachuelo bon homme cuyos tierras no se hallan aun apeadas," or "An ideal map of the habitations of the Bon Homme creek whose lands have not been delineated [up until now]." (See Figure 3.) <a href="#nlc.danisi.0157" id="lnlc.danisi.0157" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a> It was a proposed plan of the district subject to approval by the governor and soon to be given the name St. André . <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> forwarded the map to <span class="tei_name">Gayoso</span> on 28 February 1798, adding his description of the progress of the new settlement:</p>
         <p>I am sending you a small ideal map of the American's habitations, situated on the shores of the Missouri and the Bonhomme creek. Part of these are already established and in all of them they made the corn harvest last year; currently we are working to construct a mill over that which belongs to <span class="tei_name">Lorenzo Long</span>, who has brought in (for this) black stones and very intelligent workers, such that I have no doubt that this place will be prosperous before two years, for a distance from seven to ten leagues from St. Louis, and that each day's experience has shown me the necessity of appointing there a trustworthy person as Commander and who can correspond with me at least in the French language. I propose to you <span class="tei_name">Mr. James (Don Juan) MacKay</span> who has already held from your predecessor the title of Commander of the forts which are to be constructed in the Upper Missouri, he is well known as an intelligent and prudent man and the only one who speaks the French language among those who hold lands in the said place and that you can have confidence in his fidelity and it is equally well that the above—mentioned <span class="tei_name">Mr. MacKay</span> be named captain of the militia company that needs to be formed out of the said inhabitants. And as I have expressed to you, the commanders of the town of Ste. Genevieve, New Bourbon and Cape Girardeau have a compensation of 800 pesos yearly, the others equally deserve it and among them <span class="tei_name">Mr. MacKay</span>. I find that it is appropriate that you appoint him to that which I propose to you. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0158" id="lnlc.danisi.0158" class="ref_link"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s interest in the area of this plan came naturally. Once he had completed the chart for <span class="tei_name">Clamorgan</span> in October, he began looking for a place to live. The Bon Homme settlement attracted him probably because it was in need of a commandant. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0159" id="lnlc.danisi.0159" class="ref_link"><sup>[59]</sup></a> Therefore, he set himself to making a plan of the district with <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>'s assistance. Like <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span>, in 1795, when <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> proposed him as surveyor general, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> also demonstrated his abilities to the lieutenant governor. Evidently the idea worked. <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> had already chosen the location for the tract he was asking <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> to grant him. <span class="tei_name">Trudeau</span> agreed, granting<span class="tei_name"> MacKay</span> about 3700 acres near the Bon Homme Creek on 23 December 1797. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0160" id="lnlc.danisi.0160" class="ref_link"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s plan of the Bon Homme district is a small—scale map, illustrating houses, rivers, islands, hills, lot sizes, and the names of the owners of lots. This map is unique to <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s heritage; however, when comparing it to <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>'s Mississippi Valley map, a recognizable feature stands out: the manner in which the rivers are drawn. The shape and contours of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and the rendering of their sandbars, are so similar that they appear to be made by the same hand. To the untrained eye, the technical skills between <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> and <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> would have been difficult to ascertain, but it was their artistic treatment that helped solve who drafted which map. Unaware of the Bon Homme plan, historians have mistakenly credited <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> with the drafting of <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s Missouri River map. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0161" id="lnlc.danisi.0161" class="ref_link"><sup>[61]</sup></a> But an identifiable design element exists on <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s Missouri River map and on the Bon Homme plan that does not appear on <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span>'s map: it is the fleur—des—lis drawn by <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> on the north arrow. (See Figure 3.) This element, an unconventional map symbol, assisted in the recognition of his maps.</p>
         <p>When <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> began as commandant at St. André  in November 1798, he continued surveying while handling all civil and criminal matters in the district. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0162" id="lnlc.danisi.0162" class="ref_link"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Five months earlier, when <span class="tei_name">Gayoso</span> appointed <span class="tei_name">Charles De Lassus</span> as lieutenant governor, he told him that <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> merited his special attention. <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> was instructed to help <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> fulfill his duties and to pay particular attention in "obtaining the most rapid and exact information concerning the intentions of the traders from Canada in Spanish territory." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0163" id="lnlc.danisi.0163" class="ref_link"><sup>[63]</sup></a> In 1802, <span class="tei_name">Francois Perrin du Lac</span> allegedly made a voyage up the Missouri and produced a map that he ambiguously credited to "un ancien traiteur de la rivié re des Illinois...." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0164" id="lnlc.danisi.0164" class="ref_link"><sup>[64]</sup></a> Historian <span class="tei_name">Annie Abel</span>'s claim that <span class="tei_name">Perrin du Lac</span> was referring to <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Trudeau</span> as the ancient trader gave rise to an arduous debate over <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s expertise in the ensuing decades. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0165" id="lnlc.danisi.0165" class="ref_link"><sup>[65]</sup></a>

         <p>One of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>'s primary goals when planning the expedition was to find the most up—to—date maps of the Missouri River, and he had obtained several of them before arriving in St. Louis, including one by <span class="tei_name">Aaron Arrowsmith</span> and another by <span class="tei_name">David Thompson</span>. On 8 December 1803, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> arrived in St. Louis without <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> but accompanied by two interpreters from Cahokia, <span class="tei_name">John Hay</span> and <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Jarrot</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> met with <span class="tei_name">Charles De Lassus</span>, the lieutenant governor, who had become suspicious about the expedition because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> presented a French passport instead of a Spanish one. <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that if the papers had been in the name of the Spanish king, there would have been no difficulty granting the expedition access to the Missouri. <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> needed time to write to his superiors in New Orleans and ask permission; he told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> he would have an answer by the spring of 1804. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> "agreed to wait" and said that he would spend the winter on the east side of the Mississippi. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0166" id="lnlc.danisi.0166" class="ref_link"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>A day later, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the remainder of the Corps made their formal entrance in St. Louis. "Under Sales &amp;  Cullers," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted, they put ashore where "hundreds Came to the bank to view us." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was surprised to see some of his old friends from Vincennes and Kaskaskia.

            <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had asked <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> if he could meet with individuals in St. Louis who might be able to help him with the geographic information of the country. Although <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> granted permission, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote that, while the inhabitants were eager to help, "every thing must be obtained by stealth." Furthermore, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> stated that everything underwent his examination and "you may readily conceive the restraint which exists on many points." For example, when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> met with some merchants, he reported that they were all afraid of <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span>, especially the inhabitants who moved more "as tho' the fear of the Commandant, than that of god, was before their eyes. . . ." Even some of the wealthiest had been jailed for slight offenses, which "has produced a general dread of <span class="tei_name">him [De Lassus</span>] among all classes of the people." <span class="tei_name">Antoine Soulard</span>, surveyor general of Upper Louisiana, had agreed to let<span class="tei_name"> Lewis</span> copy government information from the 1800 census, but when he realized that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was going to copy the whole document, he expressed extreme fear. <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> became so agitated that <span class="tei_name">Lewis </span>desisted and wrote "if it were known that he had given me permission to copy an official paper . . . it would injure him with his government." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0168" id="lnlc.danisi.0168" class="ref_link"><sup>[68]</sup></a> Although full of trepidation, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> did help <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, but he failed to obtain the genuine map of the Missouri River. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were to depend on <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>'s map for the first part of their journey, it was absolutely urgent to meet with him.</p>
         <p>But <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> had only granted the Americans access to St. Louis, and <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, commandant of St. André, wrote that his district was a "long journey" from there. <span class="tei_name">Finiels</span> believed that a trip to St. Charles by water took about two days and St. André  was almost nine miles further west. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0169" id="lnlc.danisi.0169" class="ref_link"><sup>[69]</sup></a> Delays continued to hamper <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, and now, the most important person in Upper Louisiana lay out of reach. If the Scotsman was truly an expert, then they probably would meet often to strategize and make maps, yet it could be the height of summer before they departed.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> believed that the transfer of the country would take place at the end of December and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had relied on that information. <span class="tei_name">Henry Dearborn</span>, the secretary of war, had approved a journey up the Missouri in July 1803, and when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> on 3 October from Cincinnati, he confirmed that he would "make a tour this winter on horseback of some hundred miles ... on the South side of the Missouri." He also thought that he could prevail on <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> "to undertake a similar excurtion through some other portion of the country." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had hoped that when he arrived in St. Louis, Louisiana would have been transferred to American soil, so that by February or 1 March, he would have procured additional information about the country that would further attest "to the utility" of the expedition. In a letter dated 16 November, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> cautioned <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to revise his plans because he believed by the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> arrived in St. Louis, the Missouri River would begin to freeze. He thought that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> should remain at Cahokia or Kaskaskia for the winter and gain the necessary information he had requested months earlier instead of taking an ambiguous trip that may incur Spanish opposition, and be "exposed to risques," that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wanted to avoid at all cost. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0170" id="lnlc.danisi.0170" class="ref_link"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>In the meantime, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found an excellent site for the military encampment opposite the mouth of the Missouri River and named it Camp Dubois. Apparently, the site was well—known to the local population too and after <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had landed at the bank, several canoes of drunken Indians managed to camp near him. In the following days, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted Indians paddling up and down the Mississippi who undoubtedly alerted villagers at Portage des Sioux of the American encampment. Portage des Sioux, located on the west bank of Mississippi, was the closest Spanish settlement to Camp Dubois, about five miles up the Mississippi. <span class="tei_name">Samuel Griffith</span>, an American farmer from Portage des Sioux, visited <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on December 16, 23, and 24. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ordered <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> to accompany <span class="tei_name">Griffith</span> to purchase dairy items and <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> returned on Christmas Day with "a cheese and 4 lb butter." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0171" id="lnlc.danisi.0171" class="ref_link"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had sent another letter repeating his orders to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that he should not enter the Missouri until spring, to which <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had already indicated his compliance in his 28 December letter. Still, the most essential part of the expedition, examining an accurate map, was out of their grasp. Deciding not to wait any longer, they implemented a plan that has remained hidden for two centuries. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dispatched <span class="tei_name">Private Joseph Field </span>up the Missouri to locate<span class="tei_name"> James MacKay</span> and invite him to Camp Dubois. <span class="tei_name">Field</span> traveled "30 miles up" river to St. André  where <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> was commandant. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0172" id="lnlc.danisi.0172" class="ref_link"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>The journal entry on 10 January 1804 reveals that the historic meeting between <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> was kept secret. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ordered <span class="tei_name">Field </span>up the Missouri regardless of the subtle illegality. While <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> had granted access to St. Louis where he could monitor their activities, he certainly did not intend for <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> to reveal government information. Yet, would the St. André  commandant accept the invitation? If he did, he would have to evade telling <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span>. And, if he brought the official map of the Missouri River, a classified government document, that too would be illegal. But <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> took the risk because he needed a job. He learned in September 1803 that the United States had bought Louisiana, and he had informed a Kentucky congressman that becoming an American citizen would deprive him of his office and salary. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0173" id="lnlc.danisi.0173" class="ref_link"><sup>[73]</sup></a> By handing over the genuine map to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> updated with an additional five years of river information, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> would demonstrate his allegiance to the new American government.</p>
         <p>The journal entries preceding 10 January were brief, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> does not mention when he sent <span class="tei_name">Private Field</span> to locate <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>. <span class="tei_name">Field</span> probably left on 7 January, the same day that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> began drawing a map of the Missouri River "for the purpose of correcting from the information which I may get of the countrey to the NW." <a href="#nlc.danisi.0174" id="lnlc.danisi.0174" class="ref_link"><sup>[74]</sup></a> It may have taken <span class="tei_name">Field</span> until the morning of 9 January to find <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, who had witnessed the signing of a warranty deed at St. André. Later in the day, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> went to Marais des Lairds (Bridgeton, Missouri) to witness and authorize other documents and then went to Portage des Sioux. The portage was a thin strip of land, a peninsula between the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers north of Camp Dubois.  <a href="#nlc.danisi.0175" id="lnlc.danisi.0175" class="ref_link"><sup>[75]</sup></a> After surveying some lots at Portage des Sioux on 10 January, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> made his way to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> headquarters at Wood River. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0176" id="lnlc.danisi.0176" class="ref_link"><sup>[76]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>As <span class="tei_name">Field</span> returned to Camp Dubois, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> watched the private cross the Mississippi "between the Sheets of floating Ice with Some risque. . . ." Suspicious that <span class="tei_name">Field</span> took too long to return, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> questioned him about the trip and was told that it had been impossible for <span class="tei_name">Field</span> to cross, for "the Ice run so thick in the Missourie." That took time. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also didn't like the fact that <span class="tei_name">Field</span> had remained "so long" on the Missouri where he likely was recognized by the inhabitants. <span class="tei_name">Field</span> allayed <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> fears by saying "that the people is greatly in favour of the Americans." <span class="tei_name">Field</span> returned at 1:00 p.m., and <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> arrived at camp some time thereafter. <a href="#nlc.danisi.0177" id="lnlc.danisi.0177" class="ref_link"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>The meeting probably was long. Due to the winter weather, the afternoon hour when <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> arrived, and the fact they needed much time to discuss the intricacies of a river map written in French, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> stayed overnight and possibly longer. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> journal entries for the next two days were short; he continued to complain of being ill due to the severe "Ducking" on 9 January, and indicated that Lewis may have left the camp late on 12 January. By 21 January, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> began making detailed calculations based on the distances from Camp Dubois to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>, from the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> to the Rocky Mountains, and from the mountains to the Pacific.78 <a href="#nlc.danisi.0178" id="lnlc.danisi.0178" class="ref_link"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Finally, <span class="tei_name">De Lassus</span> received official word that Louisiana had indeed been sold to the United States. On 21 February, he wrote to <span class="tei_name">Captain Amos Stoddard</span>, the American military official who was to oversee the transfer of the country, and informed him that they should meet. They agreed to the dates to transfer ownership: on 9 March, Spain would transfer the country to France and on 10 March, France would transfer it to the United States. By 21 March, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had traveled up the Missouri with <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gratiot</span>. Sometime in the spring of 1804, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> drafted a new map based on previous maps made by <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span>, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span>, and on information gleaned from traders. That map was sent to <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span> with <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span>, who accompanied an <span class="tei_name">Osage Indian</span> delegation to Washington.  <a href="#nlc.danisi.0179" id="lnlc.danisi.0179" class="ref_link"><sup>[79]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>The convoluted history of the map of the Missouri River as high as the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages is an important but overlooked detail of the march of the Corps of Discovery. The background of <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span> and the contribution of his invaluable map shows a curious international progression to what is usually regarded as a strictly national enterprise. It was a transplanted Scot with a history of British service who, at personal risk, provided the link between the preceding Spanish and fleeting French regime to the United States' assumption of authority in Louisiana. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> predecessors had already carefully laid out a third of the landmarks that the expedition's members would note in their journals–landmarks that had been named by French voyageurs nearly a century earlier, and that, indeed, persist as toponyms (though often in English translation) to this day.</p>
