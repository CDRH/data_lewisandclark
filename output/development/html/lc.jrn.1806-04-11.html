As the tents and skins which covered both our men and baggage were wet with the rain which fell last evening, and as it continued still raining this morning we concluded to take our canoes first to the head of the rapids, hoping that by evening the rain would cease and afford us a fair afternoon to take our baggage over the portage.    this portage is two thousand eight hundred yards along a narrow rough and slipery road.    the duty of getting the canoes above the rapid was by mutual consent confided to my friend <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. C.</a> who took with him for that purpose all the party except <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton</a> who is yet so weak he is unable to work, three others who were lamed by various accedents and one other to cook for the party.    a few men were absolutely necessary at any rate to guard our baggage from the <a class="regularization" title="Watlala Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Watlala%20Indians">War-clel-lars</a> who crouded about our camp in considerable numbers.    these are the greates theives and scoundrels we have met with.    by the evening <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. C.</a> took 4 of our canoes above the rapids tho' with much difficulty and labour.    the canoes were much damaged by being driven against the rocks in dispite of every precaution which could be taken to prevent it.    the men complained of being so much fatiegued in the evening that we posponed taking up our 5th canoe untill tomorrow.    these rapids are much worse than they were fall when we passed them, at that time there were only three difficult points within seven miles, at present the whole distance is extreemly difficult of ascent, and it would be impracticable to decend except by leting down the empty vessels by a cord and then even the wrisk would be greater than in taking them up by the same means.    the water appears to be [<em class="hi">NB: considerably</em>] <a href="#n31041101" id="ln31041101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> upwards of 20 feet higher than when we decended the river.    the distance by way of the river between the points of the portage is 3 Ms— many of the natives crouded abot the bank of the river where the men were engaged in taking up the canoes; one of them had the insolence to cast stones down the bank at two of the men who happened to be a little detatched from the party at the time.    on the return of the party in the evening from the head of the rapids they met with many of the natives on the road, who seemed but illy disposed; two of these fellows met with <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">John Sheilds</a> who had delayed some time in purchasing a dog and was a considerable distance behind the party on their return with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. C.</a> they attempted to take the dog from him and pushed him out of the road.    he had nothing to defend himself with except a large knife which he drew with an intention of puting one or both of them to death before they could get themselves in readiness to use their arrows, but discovering his design they declined the combat and instantly fled through the woods.    three of this same tribe of villains the <a class="regularization" title="Watlala Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Watlala%20Indians">Wah-clel-lars</a>, stole my dog this evening, and took him towards their village; I was shortly afterwards informed of this transaction by an indian who spoke the Clatsop language, [<em class="hi">NB: some of which we had learnt from them during the winter</em>] and sent three men in pursuit of the theives with orders if they made the least resistence or difficulty in surrendering the dog to fire on them; they overtook these fellows or reather came within sight of them at the distance of about 2 miles; the indians discovering the party in pursuit of them left the dog and fled.    they also stole an ax from us, but scarcely had it in their possession before <a class="regularization" title="Thompson, John B." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Thompson%2C%20John%20B.">Thompson</a> detected them and wrest it from them.    we ordered the centinel to keep them out of camp, and informed them by signs that if they made any further attempts to steal our property or insulted our men we should put them to instant death.    a cheif of the <a class="regularization" title="Clahclellar Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clahclellar%20Indians">Clah-clel-lah tribe</a> informed us that there were two very bad men among the <a class="regularization" title="Watlala Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Watlala%20Indians">Wah-clel-lahs</a> who had been the principal actors in these seenes of outradge of which we complained, and that it was not the wish of the nation by any means to displease us.    we told him that we hoped it might be the case, but we should certainly be as good as our words if they presisted in their insolence. I am convinced that no other consideration but our number at this moment protects us. The Cheif appeared mortified at the conduct of his people, and seemed friendly disposed towards us.    as he appeared to be a man of consideration and we had reason to beleive much rispected by the neighbouring tribes we thought it well to bestoe a medal of small size upon him.    he appeared much gratifyed with this mark of distinction, and some little attention which we shewed him. <a href="#n31041102" id="ln31041102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    he had in his possession a very good pipe tomahawk which he informed us he had received as a present from a trader who visited him last winter over land pointing to the N.

I presume the former are their spring and Summer dwellings and the latter those of the fall and winter.    these houses are most generally built with boards and covered with bark.    some of an inferior ore more temperary cast are built entirely of cedar bark, which is kept smooth and extended by inserting small splinters of wood through the bark crosswise at the distance of 12 or 14 inches assunder.    several families inhabit the same appartment.    their women as well as those of the 3 villages next below us pierce the cartelage of the nose and insert various ornaments.    they very seldom imprint any figures on their skins; a few I observed had one or two longitudinal lines of dots on the front of the leg, reaching from the ankle upwards about midleg.    most of their women braid their hair in two tresses as before mentioned.    the men usually cew their hair in two parsels which like the braded tresses of the female hang over each ear in front of the sholder, and gives an additional <em class="hi">width</em> to the head and face so much admired by them.    these cews are usually formed with throngs of dressed Otterskin crossing each other and not roled in our manner arrond the hair.    in all other rispects I observe no difference in their dress habits manners &amp;c. from those in the Neighbourhood of the <a class="regularization" title="Government (Diamond, White Goose, Swan) Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Government%20%28Diamond%2C%20White%20Goose%2C%20Swan%29%20Island">diamond Island</a>.    today we recognized a man of the <a class="regularization" title="Wishram-Wasco Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Wishram-Wasco%20Indians">Elute</a> nation who reside at the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, The Dalles of the (Great Narrows)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20The%20Dalles%20of%20the%20%28Great%20Narrows%29">long narrows</a> of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>, he was on his return from a trading voyage to the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbean</a> valley with 10 or 12 others of his nation.    many other natives from the villages above were employed in taking [<em class="hi">one word erased</em>] their roots &amp;c over the portage on their return. I observed that the men equally with the women engage in the labour of carrying.    they all left their canoes below the rapids and took others above which they had left as they decended.    those which were left below were taken down the river by the persons from whom they had been hired or borrowed.    the natives from above behaved themselves in a very orderly manner.

rained the greater part of the last night and continued to rain this morning, as the Skins and the Covering of both the mend and loading were wet we determined to take the Canoes over first in hopes that by the evening the rain would Sease and afford us a fair afternoon to Carry our baggage over the portage which is 2 miles by land and a Slipery road. I therefore took all the men except three who had Sore feet and two to cook, and who were with the baggage; and with great dificuelty and much fatigue we drew up 4 of our canoes above the Rapids 3 miles in extent.    the men became So fatigued that we deturmined to puspone takeing the 5th Canoe untill tomorrow.
