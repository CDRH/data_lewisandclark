Thursday Novemr. 7th <a href="#n25110714" id="ln25110714" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>    A cool foggy morning.    We set out early, &amp; proceeded on 'till about 10 o'Clock A. M. when we arrived at an Indian Village, consisting of 4 cabbins which were inhabited by the Natives.    We halted at this place a short timber; &amp; purchased from the Indians, some fish, roots, &amp; a number of dogs.    We continued on our Voyage, and passed a number of Islands, which lay low.    These Islands were Marshy &amp; were covered with Grass, &amp; had Water laying in different parts of them.    Towards evening, we passed another Indian Village, which lay on the North side of the River, where we stopped a short time, &amp; purchased from the Natives some fresh fish, Roots &amp;ca.    The Indians who lived in this small village, where from their appearance a dirty, indolent sett of beings.    They had among them Elk meat &amp; Venison; pounded fish, roots &amp;ca.    The Indians both at this, &amp; the other Indian village that we passed this day, made signs to us that there were vessells lying at the Mouth of this River.    Some of them signed to us that the Vessells were gone away from it.    We saw among these Savages, long planks or puncheons; which they used to cover their Cabbins with.    The Men among these Indians go entirely naked, &amp; the Women have pettycoats made out of a sort of grass &amp; platted, which they wear; the other part of their body, being entirely naked.    We continued on, &amp; saw some high rough hills, which was covered with pine Trees, high clifts of rocks &amp; some Springs of water.—</p>
               <p>
We went about 35 Miles this day, &amp; encamped at a Springs run, which lay on the South side of the River, opposite to which lay in the River a high round Rock, which had very much the resemlance of a Tower; Our hunters killed this day several Geese &amp; Swans, which they brought to our Camp.—
