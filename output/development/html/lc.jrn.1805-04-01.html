From April 1 his dates appear to be correct, but he still has the days of the week wrong up through the April 7 entry in Codex C. <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> has corrected them in red, but we do not carry his emendations.
