shifting, the river is now some three miles east of the bluff summit, and
because of timber growth is no longer visible from the bluff.) This was <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>
and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> first formal meeting with any tribe of Native Americans. The <span class="tei_name">Otoe</span>-
<span class="tei_name">Missourias</span> were initially assigned a reservation area of 160,000 acres along the
present-day <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>-<span class="tei_name">Kansas</span> border but in 1881 were relocated to Indian Territory
(now parts of <span class="tei_name">Noble</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pawnee</span> Counties in Oklahoma). It was the <span class="tei_name">Otoe</span>
(often spelled <span class="tei_name">Oto</span>) who were responsible for giving <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> its name, from
an <span class="tei_name">Otoe</span> word meaning "flat water," referring to the <span class="tei_name">Platte River</span>.</p>

were established in 1856 and 1866, respectively, the <span class="tei_name">Winnebagos</span> having been
moved here from <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> and, still earlier, from <span class="tei_name">Minnesota</span>. Standing on
the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> Indian Reservation is <span class="tei_name">Blackbird Hill</span>, the gravesite of the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>
chief <span class="tei_name">Blackbird</span>, which was visited by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on August 11, 1804. <span class="tei_name">Chief
Blackbird</span> had died of smallpox in 1800 and was buried sitting erect on a horse,
and a wooden pole decorated with all of the scalps he had taken was planted
in the soil above. His gravesite is situated on the highest of the river bluffs between
<span class="tei_name">Decatur</span> and <span class="tei_name">Macy</span> but is not readily accessible. The 300-foot and now
mostly tree-covered promontory can best be seen about one mile east of Blackbird
Scenic Overview at a site three miles north of <span class="tei_name">Decatur</span> (milepost 152 on U.S.
Highway 75).</p>
                     <p>The <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> had moved into the region from the <span class="tei_name">Ohio River</span> valley by the
1700s, and by 1775 the tribe had a large village in this immediate area. During the
smallpox epidemic of 1800 the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> population was reduced from about 700
to 300, and its previous reputation as a powerful warrior society disappeared.
During the later period of displacement of Native Americans to reservations in
the mid-1800s, the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> were allowed to remain on part (originally 300,000
acres) of their original homeland. The northern part of their ceded land was
later given to the <span class="tei_name">Winnebagos</span>, and some of the remainder was later sold to
white settlers. In spite of their peaceful nature the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> were not accepted
as U.S. citizens until 1887, and their full rights of citizenship were not attained
until 1924. Similarly, the <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span> of eastern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> (the <span class="tei_name">"Pani" or "Pania"</span>
of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>) were sent in the 1850s to a relatively tiny preserve of about
300 square miles along the <span class="tei_name">Loup River</span> (now part of <span class="tei_name">Nance County</span>), an area
representing less than 1 percent of their original vast homeland along the <span class="tei_name">Platte</span>
Valley. After this land was sold to settlers in 1872 they were relocated in 1874 to
a part of Indian Territory (<span class="tei_name">Oklahoma</span>), in an area between the <span class="tei_name">Arkansas</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Cimarron Rivers</span>. At the time of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span> were probably
second only to the <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span> in population size among Plains natives, numbering
perhaps 10,000 people. By comparison, the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> may have historically
numbered about 2,800 at maximum, the <span class="tei_name">Otoes</span> about 1,800, and the <span class="tei_name">Missourias</span>
about 500. By the late 1900s there were still nearly 3,000 Natives Americans living
on <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> reservations, including about 1,300 <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>, 1,100 <span class="tei_name">Winnebagos</span>,
and about 400 <span class="tei_name">Santees</span>. The annual powwow of the <span class="tei_name">Winnebago</span> tribe occurs

hills overlooking the confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Big Sioux</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Rivers. It has
a nature trail, a demonstration prairie, and an available list of local wildflowers.
Dorothy Pecaut Nature Center, with exhibits on the Loess Hills region, is

approach 400 feet in height and range up to ten miles wide, the loess caps themselves
adding as much as about 200 feet to the underlying sedimentary substrate.
The Loess Hills region of <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span> comprises the eastern edge of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley,
and it supports over 100 nesting species of birds, 54 mammals, 24 reptiles, and
10 amphibians, according to a summary by Cornelia Mutel. There are also at
least 39 native species of trees and larger shrubs in the Loess Hills, the botanical
diversity gradually increasing from north to south. These hills are the second highest
accumulations of windblown materials ("loess" is a German term for
"loose") in the world. The silt-sized particles that were deposited here originated much
farther west, and a layer of loess several feet thick covers all of <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span>
except for the north-central section. The hills still support up to 20,000 acres of
native tallgrass prairies, much of which exist in small, diminishing patches.

12. Consists of mature riverine hardwood forest at the lower end of the
Missouri National Recreational River system. There are 17 miles of hiking trails.
A new interpretive center, the Missouri National Recreational River Resource
and Educational Center, has been constructed in <span class="tei_name">Ponca State Park</span> and focuses
on the ecology and history of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, including the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
expedition. There is a park bird checklist of about 240 species. Located near
the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsite of August 22, 1804. Camping is permitted. The
park was named after the <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span> tribe, once part of the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> tribe, which
had settled on the west bank of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> in present-day <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>
during the early 1700s. At the time of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Poncas</span> numbered
perhaps 800 people. Their initial reservation (first established in 1858 and enlarged
to 96,000 acres in 1865) was taken over in 1868 by the federal government
without prior consultation and was made part of the Great Sioux Reservation.
The resulting conflicts with the <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span>, together with a government eviction
order in 1876, forced the <span class="tei_name">Poncas</span> to resettle in Indian Territory (now <span class="tei_name">Oklahoma</span>).
They were first assigned to the then-existing Quapaw Agency during the winter
of 1877-78. The return of Chief Standing Bear only a year later with about
30 of his followers to bury his eldest son in an ancestral graveyard led to the
entire group's arrest. It produced one of the most famous courtroom scenes
in American history and raised the remarkable legal question as to whether a
Native American was a "person" under the meaning of then-existing law. The
case against Standing Bear was eventually dismissed by the Supreme Court, and
a restoration of 26,236 acres of <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span> tribal land in the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara</span> Valley occurred
in 1881, after a presidential commission reviewed the tribe's sad history. In 1884
the <span class="tei_name">Oklahoma</span> (or "Hot Country") <span class="tei_name">Poncas</span> were moved to a new reservation in
the Salt Fork River area. This group is now located in <span class="tei_name">Kay</span> and <span class="tei_name">Noble</span> Counties
of <span class="tei_name">Oklahoma</span>. However, the <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span> reservation in <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> was dissolved in
1954, and for several decades the tribe was no longer recognized by the federal
government, until it was officially restored again in 1990.</p>

miles north of <span class="tei_name">Lynch</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, on privately owned land. The nearest public
road (unnumbered but easily traveled) passes within about a half mile and offers
an excellent view of the site and several miles of the nearby river valley,
which is still fairly pristine. At the base of this promontory a colony of blacktailed
prairie dogs was discovered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the first examples of this
keystone shortgrass plains species known to science. This colony is now gone,
but others occur in the general vicinity. Several prairie dogs that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had captured alive were sent back to <span class="tei_name">Washington DC</span> in April of 1805, one
of which survived the 4,000-mile trip. It and a black-billed magpie that had

                        <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> Museum (also known as Peale's Museum), which eventually received
nearly all the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> specimens at the end of the expedition.
It was housed in <span class="tei_name">Independence Hall</span> until 1838, when it was moved the first of
two times. Finally, in 1850 its contents were sold, in part to P. T. Barnum and
in part to the Boston Museum. Some of the materials from the latter eventually
were passed on to Harvard University, but most have disappeared, including
the prairie dog.</p>

<span class="tei_name">Crow Creek</span> Indian Reservation is 125,591 acres) border both sides of the impounded
<span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> (<span class="tei_name">Lake Sharpe</span>) in the region of the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend</span> for about
80 miles of shoreline distance. These reservations are home to the Lower <span class="tei_name">Brule</span>
and <span class="tei_name">Crow Creek</span> components of the <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span>. A Native American National Scenic
Byway (Bureau of Indian Affairs Highways 10 and 4) crosses both reservations,
linking <span class="tei_name">Chamberlain</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span>. This near-wilderness road passes scenic rolling
hills that are often capped with infertile blackish Pierre shales of Cretaceous age.
The soils support arid-adapted plants such as some of the sages that were discovered
by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The two reservations collectively encompass the
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> outward-bound campsites of September 19-22, 1804, and the
return campsites of August 26 and 27, 1806. There are summer powwows (in
August), and the reservation lands support large tribal bison herds. <span class="tei_name">Fort Kiowa</span>, built in 1822, was located just south of the Lower <span class="tei_name">Brule</span> Reservation, and <span class="tei_name">Fort

and near the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsite of September 25, 1804. It was at the
nearby mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Bad ("Teton") River</span>, along the west shore of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri
River</span> (now a Fort Pierre city park), that the Corps of Discovery met three <span class="tei_name">Lakota

that led to threats and near-bloodshed over gifts and trading procedures, probably
caused or at least exacerbated by translation problems. Also in <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span> is the
South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center, with such items as an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> bullboat,

                     <p>Located near the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsites of October 8-10, 1804. It was here
that the first <span class="tei_name">Arikara ("Rikara")</span> village was encountered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>,
at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>. A smallpox epidemic in 1780–81 had already
killed most of the population of perhaps originally as many as 30,000 people. By
1800 the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> consisted of about 3,800 persons. Like the <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>, they were
part of the Caddoan-language group. The quite different Siouan language group
comprised a large, multitribal assemblage, including the <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span> and <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span>,
<span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span>, <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>, <span class="tei_name">Missouria</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Kansa</span> tribes. A monument
to <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> is located on the west side of <span class="tei_name">Lake Oahe</span> near <span class="tei_name">Mobridge</span>. It is
on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation (see below), about six miles west of
<span class="tei_name">Mobridge</span> on U.S. Highway 12 and four miles south on <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> Highway
1806. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> evidently spent the last part of her relatively short life of
about 25 years in the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Fort Manuel</span>, a Missouri Fur Company post
that was located in what is now <span class="tei_name">Corson County</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, near the present
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> border. She died in December 1812, not long after giving birth to
a daughter, Lizette. Although her exact burial site is unknown, it has probably
been covered by <span class="tei_name">Lake Oahe</span>. After the death of his mother, <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste</span> spent
a few years with <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> but later traveled abroad, became a
mountain man and guide, and died of pneumonia at the age of 61 in <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>.
About a hundred yards away is a huge (seven-ton) granite bust of Sitting Bull,
the great <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span> chief of the Indian wars, who was reburied here in 1953 after an
initial interment at <span class="tei_name">Fort Yates</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. He had surrendered in 1881 and
been brought to <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, several years after fleeing to <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>
with the survivors of his <span class="tei_name">Hunkpapa</span> community. Sitting Bull spent most of the
period from 1883 to 1890 at the Standing Rock reservation. In 1890 he was shot
and killed there, together with his son and six policemen, while he was being detained
by American Indian police, having been falsely accused of fostering the
messianic Ghost Dance ritual then sweeping the western plains. This episode
happened a year after Dakota Territory was divided into the present states of
<span class="tei_name">North</span> and <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>.</p>

                     <p>The enormous <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span> Indian Reservation (1.4 million acres) borders
the west side of <span class="tei_name">Lake Oahe</span> for much of its length, and is home to four
bands of <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span>. This reservation encompasses the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsites
of October 10-12, 1804. The even larger Standing Rock Indian Reservation
(2,328,534 acres), current home to some of the <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span>- and <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span>-dialect
branches of the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> nation, continues along the west shoreline into southwestern
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, north to about 25 miles beyond <span class="tei_name">Fort Yates</span>. The reservation
was named for a rock that is sacred to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span> and whose
form resembles that of a seated woman. It is located across from the Agency
Headquarters at <span class="tei_name">Fort Yates</span>. The reservation encompasses the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
outward-bound campsites of October 14-17, 1804, and the return campsites of
August 20-21, 1806. There are annual summer powwows (held in July at Standing
Rock, in August at <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span>) and tribal bison herds. Before the Civil
War all of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> west of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> was made part of a vast <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
Indian reservation, but in the 1870s the federal government violated its own
treaty and subdivided it. Much of this region was then taken from the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>,
including their sacred <span class="tei_name">Black Hills</span>, where gold had been discovered during General
Custer's military survey in 1874. There are still nearly 5 million acres of
reservation lands in South Dakota, totaling nine reservations and supporting
about 57,000 residents, counting three reservations whose boundaries extend
into <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> or <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Pine Ridge</span> and Rosebud Reservations of
southwestern <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> support the state's largest number of reservation
members, the <span class="tei_name">Oglala</span> and <span class="tei_name">Brule</span>, both composing part of the <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span>. Other
groups live on the <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span>, Standing Rock, and the Wood Mountain
(in Canada) Reservations. The western <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span> group comprised seven major
subgroups or tribal bands, including such famous names as the <span class="tei_name">Oglala</span>, <span class="tei_name">Brule</span>,
and <span class="tei_name">Hunkpapa</span>. Under the leadership of chiefs like Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull,
the men of these bands took their long-awaited revenge on General Custer at the
Battle of Little Bighorn. The middle group included the <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Yanktonai</span>
subgroups. The major tribal subgroups of the eastern <span class="tei_name">Dakotas</span> included
the <span class="tei_name">Sisseton</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wahpeton</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wahpekute</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Mdewakantonwon</span>.</p>

The Interpretive Center has a cottonwood dugout canoe of the type used by
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, as well as other items similar to those used by the expedition. The original <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> was built a few miles southeast of present-day
<span class="tei_name">Stanton</span>, on the northeast side of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, and close to three <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa
(two Minitari, one Amahami)</span> and two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. The fort was largely
destroyed by a prairie fire before the expedition's return in 1806. When the expedition
returned in mid-August of 1806, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> (the preferred <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>
spelling is <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span>, based on the original <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>), her <span class="tei_name">son</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>
all remained behind, as did <span class="tei_name">John Coulter</span>. <span class="tei_name">Coulter</span> later became one of the
West's most famous mountain men. <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> remained with the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> for most of his long life, serving in part as an interpreter and also
acting as a guide to Prince Maximilian in the 1830s. There is a <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>
Overlook State Historic Site 11.5 miles west of <span class="tei_name">Washburn</span> on State Highway 200a
that provides a view of the actual fort's vicinity. A reconstruction of original <span class="tei_name">Fort
Mandan</span> has been erected on a 30-acre site about ten miles downstream from the
expedition's actual 1804-5 wintering site. The Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center
in <span class="tei_name">Washburn</span> emphasizes the winter of 1804–5 that the Corps spent at <span class="tei_name">Fort
Mandan</span> and features a complete set of Karl Bodmer prints depicting the Upper

provide habitat for a wide array of other high plains mammals and birds. A
checklist of 286 bird species occurring in southwestern <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> (including
the entire region southwest of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>) has been compiled by Terry
Rich. Several of these species were originally discovered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, including

life from a life-threatening illness. The <span class="tei_name">Giant Springs</span> were discovered
by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> on June 18, 1805, and still produce a vast output of nearly
400 million gallons of water daily. They also represent the downstream end of
the portage around <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, historically a nine-mile series of five separate
falls and intervening rapids, the falls representing a collective vertical height of
nearly 200 feet. At the upper end of this long (18-mile) portage around the falls
were several islands named the <span class="tei_name">White Bear Islands</span> by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> because
of the numerous grizzly bears they found there. During the outward-bound
phase of the expedition, 11 days (June 21 to July 2, 1804) were needed for the
overland route; on the return phase only eight days were needed, as horses were
then available for hauling. Also located at the state park is the Lewis and Clark
National Historic Trail Interpretive Center, operated by the U.S. Forest Service
and home to the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation.</p>

                     </strong>
                     <p>A 170-acre state park with a mile-long "piskun," a place where bison were
stampeded into confined corrals or forced to jump from steep cliffs. This is
probably the largest reported such site in the United States, and has a 30-foot
cliff-face. A captive bison herd is present. Located about five miles west of the
<span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> airport and in the general vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsites
of July 10-14, 1805.</p>

                     </strong>
                     <p>Includes a reservoir (Holter Lake) surrounded by the Gates of the Mountains
Wilderness and Beartooth State Game Range. The entire area collectively
covers about 18,000 acres. <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> gave this part of the river its present
evocative name, "<span class="tei_name">Gates of the Rocky Mountains</span>." Located near the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsites of July 18-20, 1805. Holter Dam has raised the river's water level
about 100 feet and is one of three dams in the region (the others are Hauser
and Canyon Ferry) that have collectively produced a nearly continuous 70-mile
impoundment. Nearby, along <span class="tei_name">Prickly Pear Creek</span>, is where Lewis first briefly
observed Lewis's woodpecker, which he later (May 27, 1806) described in detail
from a specimen shot in <span class="tei_name">Idaho</span>. Camping is permitted.</p>

                     <strong>Missouri Headwaters State Park, <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>
                     </strong>
                     <p>A 527-acre state park at the confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Gallatin</span>, <span class="tei_name">Madison</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>
Rivers. Located near the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsite of July 27-30, 1805.
The site was first recognized by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as representing the primary
origin of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, although the actual snowmelt headwaters derive
from many small sources high in the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> and his group
were the first members of the expedition to arrive at the headwaters on July 25
and were followed by the rest of the group on July 27. The entire expedition
remained there until July 30, when they began the ascent up the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Beaverhead</span> Rivers, followed by challenging the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span> themselves.
The same campsite was used by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> and his contingent during the
return trip on July 13, 1806. The state park has interpretive exhibits with information
on <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Camping is permitted. Also near <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> is

from I-94. This 200-foot sandstone promontory was named "<span class="tei_name">Pompy's Tower</span>"
by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> after <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> son, <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste (Pompy) Charbonneau</span>,
then about 18 months old. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> dated, carved signature is still visible in the
soft rock. Located between the <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> campsites of July 25 and 26, 1806. Nearby
is the Pompey's Pillar Visitor Center.</p>
