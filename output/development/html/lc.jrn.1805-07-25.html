Set out at an early hour and proceeded on tolerably well the water still strong and some riffles as yesterday.    the country continues much the same as the two preceeding days.    in the forenoon we saw a large brown bear on an island but he retreated immediately to the main shore and ran off before we could get in reach of him.    they appear to be more shy here than on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> below the mountains.    we saw some antelopes of which we killed one.    these anamals appear now to have collected again is small  herds several females with their young and one or two males compose the herd usually.    some males are yet soletary or two perhaps together scattered over the plains which they seen invariably to prefer to the woodlands.    if they happen accedentaly in the woodlands and are allarmed they run immediately to the plains, seeming to plaise a just confidence in their superior fleetness and bottom.    we killed a couple of young gees which are very abundant and fine; but as they are but small game to subsist a party on of our strength I have forbid the men shooting at them as it waists a considerably quantity of amunition and delays our progress.    we passed <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark's</a> encampment of the 23rd inst.    the face of the country &amp; anamal and vegatable productions were the same as yesterday, untill late in the evening, when the valley appeared to termineate and the river was again hemned in on both sides with high caiggy and rocky clifts. <a href="#n17072501" id="ln17072501" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    soon after entering these hills or low mountains we passed a number of fine bold springs which burst out underneath the Lard. clifts near the edge of the water; they wer very cold and freestone water.    we passed a large Crk. today in the plain country, 25 yds. wide, which discharges itself on the Stard. side; it is composed of five streams which unite in the plain at no great distance from the river and have their souces in the Mts.    this stream we called <a class="regularization" title="Crow (Gass's) Creek (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Crow%20%28Gass%27s%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29">Gass's Creek</a>. <a href="#n17072502" id="ln17072502" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    after <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Sergt.

                  <em class="hi">Thursday 25th.</em>    We embarked and proceeded on at the usual time, in a 
fine morning; we passed a beautiful plain on the north side, and at 2 o'clock 
we came to the entrance of another chain of mountains; <a href="#n17072512" id="ln17072512" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> where we took 
dinner and again went on. Passing through this chain we found some difficult rapids, but good water between them. This chain of mountains are not so high, nor so rocky as those we passed before. Six very fine springs rise on 
the southern shore, about four miles above the entrance of this range. We went 16 miles and encamped on the north side.

Thursday July 25th    This morning clear &amp; pleasant, we set out as usual, and proceeded on our Voyage, and on an Island saw a large White or brown bear, &amp; in the River numbers of Otters, and a flock of Antelopes on the Shore one of which our hunters killed.—    We passed by a Camp, where <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> had staid all night, We discover'd Mountains lying ahead of us, which has the appearance of Snow being on them, from their white Colour, we still found abundance of Red &amp; Yellow currants.    We did not find the Islands or timber so plenty, as it was Yesterday.    We found large extensive plains lying on both sides of the River, which had a pleasant appearance.    In 
the afternoon we 〈enter'd into〉 passed some rough rockey hills, which we expect from the account we have from the Indian Woman that is with us, to be the commencement of the Second chain of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rockey Mountains</a>; but they do not appear, to be so high, as the first chain of Mountains which we have passed, nor so solid a rock at the entrance of them.—    We found several bad rockey Rapids, which we had to pass through, and 〈are〉 the Water was so shallow that the Rocks appeared above the Water almost across the River, We double manned our Canoes, and with difficulty got over them, by hard towing; We saw several excellent springs, which came out from under the Clifts of Rocks, near the River, We came 16 Miles this day, &amp; encamped on the North side of the River.—</p>
               <p>
The men were very much fataigued towing the Canoes this day, and some of them had their feet Cut in passing over the Rocks.—    Our hunters only killed one Goose, which was all that was killed this day.—
