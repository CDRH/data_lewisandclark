This morning was very cold.    the ice ¼ of an inch thick on the water which stood in the vessels exposed to the air.    some wet deerskins that had been spread the grass last evening are stiffly frozen.    the ink feizes in my pen.    the bottoms are perfectly covered with frost insomuch that they appear to be covered with snow. This morning early I dispatched two hunters to kill some meat if possible before the Indians arrive; <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> I sent with the horse into the cove for that purpose. The party pursued their several occupations as yesterday.    by evening I had all the baggage, saddles, and harness completely ready for a march.    after dark, I made the men take the baggage to the cash and deposit it. I beleve we have been unperceived by the Indians in this movement.    notwithstanding the coldness of the last night the day has proved excessively warm.    neither of the hunters returned this evening and I was obliged to issue pork and corn. The mockersons of both sexes are usually the same and are made of deer Elk or buffaloe skin dressed without the hair.    sometimes in the winter they make them of buffaloe skin dressed with the hair on and turn the hair inwards as the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a>

Westerly direction. <a href="#n21082102" id="ln21082102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    these friends of theirs they say inhabit a good country abounding with Elk, deer, bear, and Antelope, and possess a much greater number of horses and mules than they do themselves; or using their own figure that their horses and mules are as numerous as the grass of the plains.    the warriors or such as esteem themselves brave men wear collars made of the claws of the brown bear which are also esteemed of great value and are preserved with great care.    these claws are ornamented with beads about the thick end near which they are peirced through their sides and strung on a throng of dressed leather and tyed about the neck commonly with the upper edge of the tallon next the breast or neck but sometimes are reversed.    it is esteemed by them an act of equal celebrity the killing one of these bear or an enimy, and with the means they have of killing this animal it must really be a serious undertaking.    the sweet sented grass <a href="#n21082103" id="ln21082103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which grows very abundant on this river is either twisted or plaited and woarn around the neck in ether sex, but most commonly by the men.    they have a collar also woarn by either sex.    it generally round and about the size of a man's finger; formed of leather or silk-grass twisted or firmly rolled and covered with the quills of the porcupine of different colours.    the tusks of the Elk are pierced strung on a throng and woarn as an orniment for the neck, and is most generally woarn by the women and children.    the men frequently wear the skin of a fox <a href="#n21082104" id="ln21082104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> or a broad strip of that of the otter around the forehead and head in form of a bando.    they are also fond of the feathers of the tail of the beautifull eagle or callumet bird <a href="#n21082105" id="ln21082105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> with which they ornament their own hair and the tails and mains of their horses.

This morning early <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
