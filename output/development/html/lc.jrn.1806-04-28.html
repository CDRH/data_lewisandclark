At 10 o'clock we began to take our horses over the river at this place, as we can lessen our journey considerably by crossing: We borrowed canoes from the natives, and swam the horses alongside, and at 2 o'clock in the afternoon had them all landed safe, after a good deal of trouble. From this place we can discover a range of mountains, <a href="#n32042809" id="ln32042809" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> covered with snow, in a southeast direction and about fifty miles distant. In the evening the weather was cloudy, and it thundered and threatened rain, a few drops of which fell.
