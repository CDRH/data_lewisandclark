He had a formidable, and largely bad, reputation. Traders' and travelers' accounts agree in describing him as ugly, brutal, lecherous, bad-tempered, and homicidal, while generally acknowledging his leadership ability and prowess in war. <a class="regularization" title="Henry, Alexander (younger)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Henry%2C%20Alexander%20%28younger%29">Alexander Henry the Younger</a> seems one of the few to have given a positive evaluation of him.

When he chose to accept someone as his guest, he protected that person with all the force of his character and reputation. The <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Hidatsas</a> finally threw him out of power in 1813, after which he withdrew and established a separate village of only a few lodges. Some time later he was reportedly killed by another <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Hidatsa</a> chief, <a class="regularization" title="Red Shield" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Red%20Shield">Red Shield</a>.
