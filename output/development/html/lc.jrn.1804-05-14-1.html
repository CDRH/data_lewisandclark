The expedition was embarked on board a batteau and two periogues. The day was showery and in the evening we encamped on the north bank six miles up the river. Here we had leisure to reflect on our situation, and the nature of our engagements: and, as we had all entered this service as volunteers, to consider how far we stood pledged for the success of an expedition, which the government had projected; and which had been undertaken for the benefit and at the expence of the Union: of course of much interest and high expectation.</p>
               <p>
The best authenticated accounts informed us, that we were to pass through a country possessed by numerous, powerful and warlike nations of savages, of gigantic stature, fierce, treacherous and cruel; and particularly hostile to white men.

contains handstitched sheets covered with loose boards, 322 pages (erratically paged) in length, divided into four parts, and of varying size, from about 8½ by 6½ inches to about 7¾ by 6¼ inches.

Of the various publications which unite amusement and information, few can be justly held in higher estimation than the Journals and Narratives of Travellers and Voyagers: and in our own highly favoured country, the diffusion of general knowledge, the enterprizing spirit of the people, their commercial pursuits and habits of emigration, render such works particularly valuable and interesting; while the vigorous and unrestrained mind of the free American, by amplifying and embellishing the scenes presented to its view, enjoys the choicest luxuries of the entertainment they are calculated to afford. If it is conceded that discoveries made in North America are more important to the people of the United States than those made elsewhere, it will not be difficult to shew 
that none could have been made of so much importance to them in any part of the world as in the large tracts of country through which the late expedition, under the command of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a>, passed. For if we take a view of the different discoveries and settlements previously made, we will find that those tracts through which the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia river</a>s, and their branches flow, commonly called <em class="hi">unknown regions,</em> were the only parts remaining unexplored, which could be considered valuable.</p>
               <p>
The first discovery of the Western World by Europeans of which we have any authentick accounts, being near the southern extremity of North America, drew, as might be expected, their attention to that quarter: and the rage which this grand discovery excited for other enterprizes of the same nature; the avidity, with which avarice was stimulated to seize the precious metals, known to exist in those parts; the means held out for gratifying ambition; and the prospects of a lucrative commerce, with many other objects and considerations tended largely to extend them; while the diminution of the Northern Continent to a narrow isthmus, and its large gulfphs, bays and rivers, furnished and facilitated the means of exploring it. The spirit of enterprize, however, was not confined to the southern extremity; but extending itself to the climates congenial with those which it had left, and connecting with its researches the planting of colonies, important discoveries were made along the <a class="regularization" title="Atlantic Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast. In the mean time the project of discovering a northwest passage to the <a class="regularization" title="East Indies" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=East%20Indies">East Indies</a> led the boldest naval commanders of Europe through the inland seas, bays and straights of the north; and at length produced surveys of the shores of <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">the Pacific</a>. To these discoveries, and those occasionally made during the settlement of the country within the limits of the United States, and in Canada, the <a class="regularization" title="Hudson's Bay" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hudson%27s%20Bay">Hudson's Bay</a> company, though not famed for enterprize added something to the stock of general information, and by their establishments aided others in their enterprizes. <a class="regularization" title="Hearne, Samuel" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hearne%2C%20Samuel">Mr. Hearne</a> under the direction of this company, in an expedition which lasted from the 7th of December 1770 to the 30th of June 1772, proceeded from Prince of Wales' Fort, on the Churchhill river in latitude 58d. 47½m. north, and longitude 94d 7½m. west of Greenwich, or 19d. west of <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>, to the mouth of the Coppermine river, which according to some accounts is in latitude 72d. north and longitude 119d. west from Greenwich, or 44d. west of <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>; but is laid down by others to be in latitude about 69d. north, and longitude 112d. west from Greenwich or 37d. west from <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>. Whatever the confined views and contracted policy of the Hudson's Bay Company may, however, have omitted in the way of discovery, the enterprize and perseverance of the Canadian traders, sometime since united under the name of the North West Company, have amply supplied. Prior to the year 1789 they had extended their discoveries and establishments along the numerous lakes and rivers situated north of that high tract of country which divides the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> waters from those which run towards the north and east, to within a short distance of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. In the summer of this year <a class="regularization" title="McKenzie, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKenzie%2C%20Charles">Mr. McKenzie</a> made a voyage from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Chepewyan (Canada)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Chepewyan%20%28Canada%29">Fort Chepewyan</a> on the lake of the Hills in latitude 58d. 40m. north, and longitude 110d. 30m. west from Greenwich or 35d. 22m. west from <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>, by the way of the <a class="regularization" title="Slave River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Slave%20River">Slave river</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Slave Lake" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Slave%20Lake">Slave lake</a>, and a river by which this lake discharges its waters (since called <a class="regularization" title="McKenzie, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKenzie%2C%20Charles">McKenzie's</a> river) to the mouth of that river, where it falls into the <a class="regularization" title="North Sea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=North%20Sea">North sea</a>, in latitude 69d. 14m. north and longitude 135d. west from Greenwich, or 59d. 52m. west from <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>.

               <p>
By the discoveries alluded to, and those occasionally made during the rapid settlement of the country and the progress of enterprize, the principal divisions of this Northern Continent has been explored and become known. The line separating these from the parts which remained unexplored and unknown, may be considered as commencing at <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">the Pacific</a> ocean in latitude about 38d. north, and running along the high lands and mountains between the waters which fall into the gulphs of <a class="regularization" title="California" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=California">California</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Mexico" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mexico">Mexico</a> and those which fall into the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri river</a>, and continuing in that direction to the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>; thence up that river to the source of its highest north western branch; thence along the high tract of country which divides the waters of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> from those which fall into <a class="regularization" title="Hudson's Bay" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hudson%27s%20Bay">Hudson's Bay</a> and the <a class="regularization" title="North Sea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=North%20Sea">North sea</a>; from whence it will continue across the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">the Pacific</a> ocean in latitude about 52d. north.

This tract from its situation may be supposed to contain the chief part of those lands in the great western division of the continent of North America fit for tillage: and this circumstance will therefore in a special manner claim the attention of an agricultural people, render more interesting a description of them, and attach additional value to the history of the country. It will not be forgotten that an immense sum of treasure has been expended in the purchase of this country, and that it is now considered as belonging to the United States. Here at no distant period settlements may be formed; and in a much shorter term than has elapsed since the first were made in America, from which hath arisen a great, powerful and independent nation, the posterity of the present inhabitants of the Union may unfurl the standard of independence on the plains of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>.</p>

With respect to the accuracy of the relations given in the following pages, it may be necessary to inform those readers not acquainted with the fact, that the principal object in sending out the expedition was to gain some correct account of the country: and that this might be done more effectually, and the information collected, preserved with more certainty, it was enjoined upon the several persons belonging to the corps, who were considered capable, to keep journals, and every necessary information and assistance given them for that purpose: these journals were also from time to time compared, corrected and any blanks, which had been left, filled up, and unavoidable omissions supplied. By thus multiplying the journals, revising and correcting them, the chances of securing to the country a true account of the progress of the expedition and of the discoveries which should be made, especially should the party be attacked and defeated by the savages or meet with any other disasters in their hazardous enterprize, were also multiplied.</p>

The following is an extract of a certificate delivered by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> to  <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Mr. Gass</a>, dated <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> 10th Oct. 1806.</p>
               <p>
"As a tribute justly due to the merits of the said <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a>, I with chearfulness declare, that the ample support, which he gave me, under every difficulty; the manly firmness, which he evinced on every necessary occasion; and the fortitude with which he bore the fatigues and painful sufferings incident to that long voyage, intitles him to my highest confidence and sincere thanks, while it eminently recommends him to the consideration and respect of his fellow citizens."</p>
               <p>
In determining the form in which the work should appear, the publisher had some difficulty. Two plans presented themselves. The one was to preserve the form of a daily journal (in which the original had been kept) and give a plain description of the country and a simple relation of occurrences equally intelligible to all readers; leaving to every person an opportunity of embellishing the scenes presented to him in his own way. The other plan was to more fully digest the subject, make the narrative more general, and assuming less of the journal form and style, describe and clothe the principal parts of it as his fancy might suggest. However far the latter might have been proper had a foreign country been the subject, and the principal object of the publication, mere amusement, many objections occurred to it in the present case; and rendered the former the most eligible, especially as by it the climate and face of the country will be more satisfactorily described. And <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Mr. Gass</a> having declared that the beauties and deformities of its grandest scenes were equally beyond the power of description, no attempts have been 
either by him or the publisher to give adequate representations of them.</p>
               <p>
The publisher hopes that the curiosity of the reader will be in some degree gratified; that the information furnished will not be uninteresting; and that some aid will be furnished those who wish to acquire a Geographical knowledge of their country. <em class="hi">26th March, 1807</em>

On presenting this Volume to my fellow Citizens, it is not necessary to enter into particular account of this Voyage; but I trust that the generous public, will make such allowances as they shall think fit, to one who has never before presented himself to them in the character of an Author; for which the course and occupations of my life; has by no means qualified me, being much better calculated to perform the Voyage (arduous as it might be) than to write an account of it; however it is now offered to the Public, with the submission that becomes me.    I was led at an early period of my life to enter into the Army of the United States, by views I had to acquire Military knowledge, &amp; to be acquainted with the Country in which I was born; and accordingly was somewhat gratified by being ordered (shortly after I joined the Service) to <a class="regularization" title="Kaskaskia, Ill." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kaskaskia%2C%20Ill.">Kaskaskias</a> Village, in the <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a> Country.—    I there, from frequent conversations, I had with Traders; whose traffic was with the Indians, residing on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a> River, contemplated that there might be a practibility of penetrating across the Continent of North America, to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> by way of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a> River, but found from the most perfect account that I could collect from any of them; did not extend beyond the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> Nation, who inhabited on the same River <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a>, which lays in 47° 24' 12 North Latitude; the Countries beyond that place, being utterly unknown to them, and even to the Indians inhabiting that Country.</p>
               <p>
I had been at <a class="regularization" title="Kaskaskia, Ill." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kaskaskia%2C%20Ill.">Kaskaskia</a> Village some time, when I was informed That His Excellency <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</a> Esquire, President of the United States, had appointed <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Meriweather Lewis</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain William Clark</a>, to take the command of a party of Continental Troops, and Volunteers; in order to explore the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a> River; and find out its source; and to find (if possible) by that rout a passage to <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">the Pacific</a> ocean.—    I was fortunate in being chosen one of the party of Continental Troops by them, which contributed much to quicken the execution of my favorite project, and of satisfying my own ambition.    The dangers I have encounter'd, and the toils I have suffered, have found their recompence, nor will the many and tedious days, or the gloomy and inclement nights that I have passed, have been passed in vain.—    This Voyage I hope has settled 
the dubious point respecting the Source of the great Rivers <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>; and I trust that it has set that long agitated question at rest, in regard to a passage being across the Continent of North America, to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, and the Northern boundary of Louisiana.—</p>

In this Voyage I furnished myself with books, and also got from Captains <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, every information that lay in their power, in order to compleat and make my Journal correct; and part of my Journals were kept by one of them when I was on a fataigue party.—    This was done by them, in case of any great accident happening to the party, so that if any of them should return to the United States, or their Journals fall into the hands of any civiliz'd Nation, that the grand object of our discovery's might not be defeated.    The object being accomplished, it lays with you to determine the practibility of a commercial communication across the continent of North America, between the <a class="regularization" title="Atlantic Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>s which is proved by my Journal.—    Nor do I hesitate to declare, my decided opinion, that very great, and essential advantages, may be derived; by extending our Trade, from one Sea, to the other.</p>
               <p>
The very great advantages of the fur trade, from that hitherto unknown Country, both by ascending the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a> River, and by way of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">the Pacific</a> ocean, will I trust prove Interesting to a Nation, whose general policy, is blended with, and whose prosperity is supported by the persuits of commerce.—    It will also qualify the reader, to pursue the succeeding Voyages, with superior intelligence and satisfaction.—    This Voyage will not I fear afford the variety, that may be expected from it; and that which it offers to the Eye, is not of a nature to be effectually transferred to the Page; Mountains and Valleys, the vast Priaries; the wide spreading forests, the lakes and Rivers, on both sides of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, succeed each other in general description;</p>
               <p>
The permanent Villages, both on the Rivers Missouri River, and <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>; and the Inhabitants in general, with bands of wandering Indians, are the only people, whom I shall introduce to the acquaintance of my readers.—    The Buffalo, the white Bear; the Elk, the Antelope, the mountain Goat, &amp; the Beaver; are mostly so familiar to the Naturalists, and are so frequently described, that a bare mention of them, as they enliven'd the landscapes, or were hunted for food; with a cursory account of the soil, the course of the Rivers, and their various produce, is all that can reasonably be expected from me.—    The toil of our Navigation to the source of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a>, was incessant; and often times extreme, and in our progress over the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, with the Burthens on our shoulders; which aggravated the Toils of our march, and added to the wearisomeness of our way, adding to which the extreme dangers we encounter'd in descending the River <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> at a season of the Year, that not even the Natives of the soil would attempt; I hope will convince my readers, that Manly fortitude and perseverance was our only guide.—</p>
               <p>
Though the events, which compose my Journal, may have little in itself to strike the imagination of those who love to be astonished; nevertheless, when it is consider'd, that we explored those Waters, which had never before borne any other Vessell, than the Canoe of the Savage; and traversed those Forests and plains, where no American Citizen, or European had ever before presented themselves, to the Eye of its swarthy natives; when to these considerations, are added, the Important objects which were pursued; with the dangers that were encounter'd, and the difficulties that were surmounted to attain them; this work will, I flatter myself, be found to excite an interest, and conciliate regard, in the minds of those who peruse it.—    I hope the generous public, will indulge me, by believing; that I have laid before them, only whatever I saw, (or were seen by Captains <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>) with the impression of the moment; that it was told by them, or presented itself to me, and have never allowed myself to wander into conjecture, but have given as full, and exact account of the Country, and other transactions, that occur'd in the Country, that we passed through, as my abilities would allow.    I cannot in justice to myself omit saying, that the manly, and soldier-like behaviour; and enterprizing abilities; of both <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clark</a>, claim my utmost gratitude:    and the humanity shown at all times by them, to those under their command, on this perilous and important Voyage of discovery; I hope will ever fill the breasts of Men who were under their command with the 〈will〉 same, and make their characters be esteem'd by the American people, and mankind in general; and convince the generous Public, that the President of the United States, did not misplace his judgment, when he appointed them to the command of this party on discovery; which is of so great a magnitude and utility, to the United States and mankind in general.—</p>
               <p>
I am not a candidate for literary fame, at the same time, I cannot but indulge the hope, that this volume, with all its imperfections, will not be thought unworthy the attention of the scientific Geographer; and that by unfolding Countries; hitherto unexplored, and which I presume, may be considered as a part belonging to the United States, it will be received as a faithful tribute to the prosperity of my Country.</p>
