                  <em class="hi">Thursday 5th.</em>    Again we had a wet stormy day, so that the men were unable to proceed with the canoes.

Lewis</a> and three of his party came back to camp; the other two were left to take care of some meat they had killed.

There is more wet weather on this coast, than I ever knew in any other place; during a month, we have had three fair days; and there is no prospect of a change.
