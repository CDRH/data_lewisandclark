〈<em class="hi">Friday</em>〉 Sunday 13th <em class="hi">Oct. 1805</em>.    a rainy wet morning.    we delayed untill about 10 oClock A. m. then took 2 of the canoes at a time down the rapids.    all the men which could not Swim went by land and carried Some rifles &amp; Instruments &amp;c.    we got Safe below the rapids by 12 oClock.    dined on Sammon and proceeded over Several more rapids    the wind hard a head.    cleard off about 2 oC. P. m.    we Saw Several Old camps where the natives fish in the Spring, but no timber except what they raft down a long distance, and they Scaffel it up verry carefully.    towards evening we came to 
a verry rockey place in the River &amp; rapid    the River all confined in a narrow channel only about 15 <a href="#n23101308" id="ln23101308" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> yds. wide for about 2 mile and ran as [s]wift as a mill tale    the canoes ran down this channel Swifter than any horse could run.    a great fishery below these rapids.    Saw 2 Indians Swim their horses across the River to the N. S. and follow down the River    they have to ride fast to keep up with us for the current mostly rapid.    the clifts &amp; hills high plains &amp; barrons continues on each Side of the River as usal.    we Came [<em class="hi">blank</em>] miles this day and Camped on the Stard Side.    passed a Creek on the Lard. Side this aftr. noon.</p>
               <p>
Sunday October 13th    This morning we had Rain &amp; delayed setting out till about 10 o'Clock A. M.    We took 2 of our Canoes at a time down the Rapids.    The Men that were among us, that could not swim, went by land, 
to go below these Rapids.    They carried with them some Rifle Guns &amp; Mathematical Instruments &amp;ca.    We were fortunate in getting all our Canoes safe over these Rapids, by 12 o'Clock A. M. when we halted to dine on Salmon.    We proceeded on our Voyage about 2 o'Clock P. M. &amp; passed several old fishing Camps, where the Natives come to catch Salmon in the spring of the Year.    We crossed several more Rapids which were not difficult to pass.    About 3 o'Clock P. M. the wind rose from the West &amp; the Weather became clear &amp; pleasant.    We saw no Timber this day, excepting what the Natives had rafted down the River a great distance, which they Scaffold up very carefully.    Towards evening we came to a very rockey place lying in the River, which run very rapid.    The River at this place was confined in a narrow channell, &amp; was only about 150 Yards wide for about 2 Miles &amp; ran as swift as Water from a Mill tail.—    Our Canoes descended the River at this place with much more swiftness than a common horse could run the same distance.    We found below these falls a great Indian fishery &amp; saw 2 Indians swim their horses across the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, to the North side of it.    They followed us down the River &amp; had to ride fast, to come up with us.    The current of the River run mostly very rapid, the Hills &amp; plains high, &amp; some 
Clifts of rocks.    The land is very Barren on both sides of the River as usual.    We came 35 Miles from the best computation we can make this day &amp; encamped on the North side of the River.    Our Course for these several days past has been West.    We passed by a Creek this afternoon lying on the South side of the River which was small.
