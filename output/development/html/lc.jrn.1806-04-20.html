This morning I was informed that the natives had pilfered six tomahawks and a knife from the party in the course of the last night. I spoke to the cheif on this subject.    he appeared angry with his people and addressed them but the property was not restored.    one horse which I had purchased and paid for yesterday and which could not be found when I ordered the horses into close confinement yesterday I was now informed had been gambled away by the rascal who had sold it to me and had been taken away by a man of another nation. I therefore took the goods back from this fellow. I purchased a gun from the cheif for which I gave him 2 Elkskins.    in the course of the day I obtained two other indifferent horses for which I gave an extravigant price. I found that I should get no more horses and therefore resolved to proceed tomorrow morning with those which I had and to convey the baggage in two small canoes that the horses could not carry.    for his purpose I had a load made up for seven horses, the eighth <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton</a> was compelled to ride as he was yet unable to walk.

These people have yet a large quantity of dryed fish on hand yet they will not let us have any but for an exorbitant price.    we purchased two dogs and some shappellel from them. I had the horses graized untill evening and then picquited and hubbled within the limited of our camp. I ordered the indians from our camp this evening and informed them that if I caught them attempting to perloin any article from us I would beat them severely.    they went off in reather a bad humour and I directed the party to examine their arms and be on their guard.    they stole two spoons from us in the course of the day.

I could not precure a Single horse of those people, dureing this day at any price, they offered me 2 for 2 kittles of which we Could not spear. I used every artifice decent &amp; even false Statements to enduce those pore devils to Sell me horses.    in the evening two different men offered to Sell me three horses which they informed me was a little distance off and they would bring them imediately.    those two persons as I found went imediately off up the river to their tribe without any intention to find or Sell their horses.    a little before Sunset 3 men arived from Some distance above and informed me that they Came to See me.    at Sunset finding no probability of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt Lewis</a> arival, packed up the articles and took them into the lodge in which I lay last night.

                  <em class="hi">Sunday 20th.</em>    This was a pleasant morning with some white frost. We got two more horses and lost one; remained here all day and had a great deal of trouble with our horses, as they are all studs, and break almost every rope we can raise. We had to tie them up at night, and one broke away notwithstanding all our care and attention. We have also much trouble with the Indians as they are disposed to steal whenever they have an opportunity. With all our care they stole 4 or 5 tomahawks.
