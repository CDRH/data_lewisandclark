The wind continued to blow tolerably hard this morning but by no means as violently as it did yesterday; we determined to set out and accordingly departed a little before seven. I walked on shore on the N. side of the river, and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> proceeded with the party.    the river bottoms through [<em class="hi">NB:</em> 〈<em class="hi">copy this for <a class="regularization" title="Barton, Benjamin Smith" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Barton%2C%20Benjamin%20Smith">Dr Barton</a>

The wind blew so hard that I concluded it was impossible fror the perogues and canoes to proceed and therefore returned and joined them about three in the evening. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
