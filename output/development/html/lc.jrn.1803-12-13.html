            <div class="footnote" id="n03121301">1. Here begin the Field Notes, kept by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> during the five months spent at the <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Wood River winter camp</a>. The <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Dubois</a> Journal consists of twelve loose sheets of different sizes, on which are found not only dated entries but other miscellaneous, undated material; the thrifty captains used the same sheets for a variety of purposes. In Osgood's edition of the Field Notes, each sheet was given a document number, and the material was arranged largely according to the document on which it occurs. The same document numbers are used here in reference to the sheets. In this edition, chronological order is followed wherever possible; thus, entries that bear a date before December 13, 1803, have been placed with the Eastern Journal material. Material that cannot be dated is placed according to the sheet on which it occurs. In determining order, the sheets are read from left to right and top to bottom insofar as possible, allowing for the fact that on many sheets the writing runs in several different directions. Obverse and reverse of each sheet are determined by the dates of the entries. Apparently the captains did not regard this journal as an official document because they were not traveling and the expedition had not actually begun; hence it is extremely sketchy and disorganized. On both sides of this first sheet are drawings of squares and rectangles, apparently representing plans for the <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">River Dubois camp</a> (see fig. 5). It is not clear which plan was eventually adopted. There are also many jottings on this sheet that are illegible or that seem unworthy of adding to this text, words like "Perogues" or "take off the Deed [dead?]." Doodles are also present. Facsimiles of these documents are accessible in Osgood's edition. (<a href="#ln03121301">back</a>)</div>
