                  <span class="italic">Saturday 16th.</span>    There was a fine cool day; and we yet remained here, waiting an answer from the natives. Some of these Indians are very kind and obliging; furnishing us with corn, beans and squashes; but there are others very troublesome, and steal whenever they have an opportunity. Yesterday and to-day, they stole several knives and spoons; and three powder-horns, and two pouches, filled with ammunition.</p>
               <p>
In the afternoon the chief, called the <a class="regularization" title="Big White (Sheheke)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Big%20White%20%28Sheheke%29">Big-White</a>, concluded to go down with us, and we agreed to stay until 12 o'clock to-morrow, that he might have an opportunity to get ready for his voyage and mission. The Commanding Officers gave discharges to the man who agreed to return with the hunters up the river, and the interpreter; <a href="#n39081606" id="ln39081606" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> who intends settling among these Indians, and to whom they gave the blacksmith's tools; supposing they might be useful to the nation.
