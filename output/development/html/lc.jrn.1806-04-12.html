It rained the greater part of last night and still continued to rain this morning.    I therefore determined to take up the remaining perogue this morning for which purpose I took with me every man that could be of any service.    a small distance above our camp there is one of the most difficult parts of the rapid.    at this place the current sets with great violence against a projecting rock.    in hawling the perogue arround this point the bow unfortunately took the current at too great a distance from the rock, she turned her side to the stream and the utmost exertions of all the party were unable to resist the forse with which she was driven by the current, they were compelled to let loose the cord and of course both perogue and cord went a drift with the stream.    the loss of this perogue will I fear compell us to purchase one or more canoes of the indians at an extravegant price.    after breakfast all hands were employed in taking our baggage over the portage.    we caused all the men who had short rifles to carry them, <a href="#n31041201" id="ln31041201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in order to be prepared for the natives should they make any attempts to rob or injure them.
