Readers of this book will undoubtedly wonder why the most famous Indian associated with the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition is mentioned so infrequently. Over the past century a powerful mythology has grown up, making extravagant claims for <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> as expedition guide and American heroine. Writers from Eva Emery Dye and Grace R. Hebard to Donald Culross Peattie and Anna Lee Waldo have fashioned narratives that go far beyond what can be known from reputable historical sources. When evidence runs thin, many writers have been all too willing to pass off fabrication for fact. Thus the claims still persist that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> single-handedly guided the expedition through unknown lands to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> and that she died an old woman at <span class="tei_name">Wind River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wyoming</span> in 1884. Such myths diminish <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and make a balanced evaluation of her genuine contributions more difficult. More important, they draw our attention away from those native men and women who made more fundamental contributions to the expedition's success.</p>
               <p>
What is reliably known about <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> makes for only a brief biographical sketch. Sometime in the fall of 1800, the young <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   girl, then perhaps twelve or thirteen years old, was camped at the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks of the Missouri</span> with others from her band. As so often happened to northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   who ventured out on the plains to hunt buffalo, the party at <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> was attacked by <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> raiders. In the fighting that followed, several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were killed. Among the prisoners taken were four boys and several women, including <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>. Sometime between 1800 and 1804, she and one other 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   captive were purchased by <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>, a trader with ties to the North West Company. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> met <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> on November 4, 1804, the trader and his family were living at the <span class="tei_name">Awatixa Hidatsa</span> village of <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span>. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was already pregnant and on February 11, 1805, she gave birth to a son named <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste</span>. When <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span> was finally hired by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as an interpreter, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and her chid became part of the Corps of Discovery.</p>
               <p>
Three questions about <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> have long fascinated <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> scholars. The name of the Indian woman—its meaning and proper spelling—continues to spark considerable debate. <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span> have all had their partisans. The concern about spelling is not just a quibble over orthography. If the woman's name was <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>, the word might be 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , meaning "boat launcher." However, if the spelling is more properly <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, the name would be <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> and translate as "Bird Woman." The journal evidence from <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> appears as to support a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> derivation. On May 20, 1805, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote: "<span class="tei_name">Sah cagah we ah</span> or <span class="tei_name">bird woman's River</span>" to name what is now <span class="tei_name">Crooked Creek</span> in north-central <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. The most effective arguments for a <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> spelling and a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> meaning are offered by Irving Anderson in his "<span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span>?" (<span class="italic">South Dakota History</span> 8 [1978]:303–11). Anderson summarizes the previous literature and finds that the <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> spelling best fits both the historical and linguistic evidence. However, it should be noted that an unpublished paper by Bob Saindon, "'<span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>': The Origin and Meaning of a Name," does raise important questions about the whole matter. Both Anderson and Saindon rely heavily on the findings of professional linguists, who in turn differ considerably in their conclusions. Along with the historian Donald Jackson, I have found the <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> spelling most acceptable.</p>
               <p>
Far more important than the spelling and meaning of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> name is the nature and scope of her contributions to the expedition. Perhaps the most persistent <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> myth is that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> "guided" the party to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. In countless statues, poems, paintings, and books she is depicted as a westward-pointing pathfinder providing invaluable direction for bewildered explorers. In the interest of correction, there has been a tendency to underestimate <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> genuine achievements as a member of the Corps of Discovery. Not as important as <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> or <span class="tei_name">John Ordway</span>, the young woman did make significant contributions to the expedition's success.</p>
               <p>
Those contributions can be discussed under four heads. When the expedition left <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> in April 1805, its most immediate need was to find the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   Indians and obtain horses for what was assumed would be an easy mountain portage to <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> waters. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> certainly believed that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> would be of considerable value in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   mission. They expected that she might recognize landmarks along the route and would provide general information about the location of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   camps. When <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> became ill at the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted, "This gave me some concern as well as for the poor object herself, than with the young child in her arms, as from the consideration of her being our only dependence for friendly negocition with the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span>." <a href="#n1101" id="ln1101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> But just what the captains expected from her in those talks is not plain. For reasons that are now unclear, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was not included in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> advance party that finally made contact with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   in August 1805. Good relations between the explorers and <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> depended far more on promises of guns and trades than on any intercessions made by <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was not an expedition guide in the usual sense of the word. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> needed to make a critical decision in early June 1805 about the true channel of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, she took no part in the process. Much later, when the expedition needed guides, men like <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span>, <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> were hired for that duty. Only twice did <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> provide what might be termed guide services. In late July and early August 1805, she recognized important geographical features on the way to find 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   camps. On the return journey in 1806, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> accompanied <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party and provided the explorer with valuable information on what has since been named <span class="tei_name">Bozeman Pass</span>. For most of the transcontinental journey, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was seeing country as new to her as it was to the captains. That she was not in the lead making trail decisions does not diminish the fact that when she did recognize a landmark, "this piece of information cheered the spirits of the party." <a href="#n1102" id="ln1102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Success in many of the expedition's Indian missions depended on reliable communication and translation. Both diplomacy and the collection of ethnographic information demanded the sort of communication that <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard's</span> signs could not always provide. One of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> most important roles in the expedition was that of translator, or as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> quaintly put it, "interpretress with the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span>." She often worked as part of a long and cumbersome translation chain that took each native word through many speakers before reaching the captains. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was able to continue those duties west of the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span> because of the presence of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   prisoners among groups that did not speak 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  . Talks with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   at <span class="tei_name">Ross's Hole</span> were conducted through such a prisoner, as were those on the return journey with the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  .</p>
               <p>
The expedition also benefited from the physical presence of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and her child. Indians who might have thought the explorers part of a war party were evidently reassured when they saw a woman and an infant in the group. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> said as much when he wrote, "The <span class="tei_name">Wife</span> of <span class="tei_name">Shabono</span> our interpreter We find reconsiles all the Indians, as to our friendly intentions. A woman with a party of men is a token of peace." <a href="#n1103" id="ln1103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> life and accomplishments have been hotly debated, controversy has also swirled around the date and place of her death. When Grace R. Hebard published her <span class="italic">
                     <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>
                  </span> in 1933, she claimed that the Indian woman had lived at <span class="tei_name">Wind River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wyoming</span>, under the name Porivo until her death in 1884. As Irving Anderson points out in his closely argued "Probing the Riddle of the Bird Woman" (<span class="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</span> 23 [1973]: 2–17), Hebard's book misinterpreted some evidence and neglected much more. Statements by <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> and trader John C. Luttig make it plain that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> died on December 20, 1812, at <span class="tei_name">Fort Manuel</span> in present-day <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. Most scholars now accept <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> note in his Cash Book that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was dead by the 1825–28 period and Luttig's note—"this Evening the wife of <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, a <span class="tei_name">Snake</span> Squaw, died of a putrid fever she was a good and the best woman in the fort, aged abt 25 years"—as substantial evidence for <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> early death.</p>
               <p>
From the time of the expedition itself, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> has prompted strong opinions. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> themselves wrote quite different evaluations of the woman and her place in expedition history. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, evidently unimpressed with her, declared, "If she has enough to eat and a few trinkets I beleive she would be perfectly content anywhere." <a href="#n1104" id="ln1104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not share what seems the ill-concealed contempt in those lines. He wrote to <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span> after the journey was over, "Your woman who accompanied you that long dangerous and fatigueing rout to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Ocian</span> and back diserved a greater reward for her attention and services on that rout than we had in our power to give her at the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  ." <a href="#n1105" id="ln1105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> care for the <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> children after the expedition is yet another measure of his esteem for their mother.</p>
               <p>
Readers in search of a balanced treatment of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> might begin with Irving Anderson, "Probing the Riddle of the Bird Woman," <span class="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</span> 23 (1973): 2–17, and E. G. Chuinard, "The Bird Woman: Purposeful Member of the Corps or Casual 'Tag-Along,'" <span class="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</span> 26 (1976): 18–29. Also of considerable value are Irving Anderson, "A <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> Family Portrait," <span class="italic">American West</span> 17 (1980): 4–13, 63–64; C. S. Kingston, "<span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span> as a Guide—The Evaluation of a Legend," <span class="italic">Pacific Northwest Quarterly</span> 35 (1944): 2–18; Blanche Schroer, "Boat-Pusher or Bird-Woman? <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> or <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>?" <span class="italic">Annals of Wyoming</span> 52 (1980): 46–54. The best book-length treatment is Harold P. Howard, <span class="italic">
                     <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>
                  </span> (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1971). Ella P. Clark and Margot Edmonds, <span class="italic">
                     <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>
                  </span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979) must be read with caution since it uncritically accepts the notion of a <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> who lived into the 1880s. Recent novels about <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, including Anna Lee Waldo, <span class="italic">
                     <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>
                  </span> (New York: Avon Books, 1979) must be read as fiction, not history. Their claims to historical accuracy are dubious at best and misleading at worst.
