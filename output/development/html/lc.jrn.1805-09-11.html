Saw one lodge made of Earth.    the pine trees pealed for some distance around.    the natives eat the enside bark.

At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the horse was found, and we proceeded on up the creek nearly a west course, through small bottoms. We went about 6 miles and encamped when our hunters came in but had killed nothing. The country is poor and mountainous.

Wednesday Septemr—. 11th    A Beautiful pleasant morning, and we all turned out to hunt up our horses, but they were so scattered, that we did not find them all untill 12 o'Clock A.

               <p>
We proceeded on up this large Creek nearly a West course, where we found the narrow bottoms along the Creek mostly covered with Pine timber; and passed by a Pine Tree on which a number of figures were painted 〈on it〉, &amp; a White Bearskin hanging on the same tree, the figures were painted by the Natives &amp; the White bear Skin, were placed there also by them.    We suppose this place to be a place of Worship among them.    We came about 7 Miles this evening, and encamped on a smooth plain, near the Creek that we had left &amp; where there had lately been an encampment (which was large) of Indians.    We saw one encampment here made out of Earth &amp; the Pine trees, pealed as high up as a Man could reach, which we suppose the Natives had done in order to get the inside bark, for to mix with their dried fruit to eat; it being the manner in which they prepare it—    We found the Wild or Choke Cherries plenty at this place.—
