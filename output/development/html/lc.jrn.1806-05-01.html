We collected our horses tolerably early this morning took and set out a little after 7 A. M.    we pursued the indian road which led us up the creek about nine miles, here the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> man wo was in front with me informed that an old unbeaten tract which he pointed out to the left was our nearest rout.    〈I〉 we halted the party and directed them to unload and let their horses graize untill our guide came up who was at some distance behind. I wished to obtain good information of this newly recommended tract before I could consent to leave the present road which seemed to lead us in the proper direction was level and furnished with wood and water.    when the guide arrived he seemed much displeased with the other, he assured us that the rout up the creek was the nearest, and much the best, that if we took the other we would be obliged to remain here untill tomorrow morning, and then travel a whole day before we could reach water, and that there was no wood; the other agreed that this was the case.    we therefore did not hesitate to pursue the rout recommended by the guide. <a href="#n32050101" id="ln32050101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    the creek, it's bottom lands, and the appearance of the plains were much as those of esterday only with this difference that the latter were not so sandy.    we had sent out four hunters this morning two on foot and 2 on horseback they joined us while we halted here. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> had killed a beaver.    at 1 P.

This morning we collected our horses and made an early Start, haveing preveously Sent a hed 4 hunters with derections to proceed up the Creek and kill every Species of game which they might meet with.    the Small portion of rain which fell last night Caused the road to be much furmer and better than yesterday.    the morning Cloudy and Cool.    we proceeded up the Creek on the N. E. Side through a Countrey of less sand and Some rich bottoms on the Creek which is partially Supplyed with Small Cotton trees, willow, red willow, choke Cherry, white thorn, birch, elder, <a href="#n32050104" id="ln32050104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> [<em class="hi">blank</em>] rose &amp; honey suckle. Great portion of these bottoms has been latterly burnt which has entirely distroyed the timbered growth. at the distance of <em class="hi">nine</em> miles we over took our hunters, they had killed one bever only    at this place the road forked, one leaveing the Creek and the Corse of it is nearly North.    the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> who had accompanied us with his family informed us that this was our best way.    that it was a long distance without water.    and advised us to Camp on the Creek at this place and in the morning to Set out early. This information perplexed us a little, in as much as the idea of going a days march without water thro an open sandy plain and on a Course 50° our [out?] of our derection.    we deturmined to unlode and wate for our Guide, or the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> man who had accompanied us from the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, The Dalles of the (Great Narrows)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20The%20Dalles%20of%20the%20%28Great%20Narrows%29">long Narrows</a>, who was in the rear with <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> our interpreter.    on his arrival we enquired of him which was the best and most direct roade for us to take.    he informed us that the road pointed out by his cumerade was through a open hilly and Sandy Countrey to the river <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Lewis's River</a>, and was a long ways around, and that we Could not git to any water to day.    the other roade up the creek was a more derect Course, plenty of water wood and only one hill in the whole distance and the road which he had always recommended to us. Some words took place between those two men    the latter appeared in great pation Mounted his horse and Set out up the Creek. we Sent a man after him and brought him back informed him that we believed what he Said and Should imedeately after dinner proceed on the road up the Creek with him.    we gave the former man Some powder and ball which had been promised him, and after an early dinner Set out up the Creek with our guide leaveing the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> man and his family encamped at the forks of the road where they intended to Stay untill the morning and proceed on the rout he had recommended to us. we traviled 17 miles this evening makeing a total of 26 mls. and encamped.    the first 3 miles of our afternoons march was through a Simaler Country of that of the fore noon; the Creek bottoms then became higher and wider; to the extent of from 2 to 3 miles.    we Saw Several Deer of which <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Labiech</a> killed one.    the timber on the Creek became more abundant and less burnt, and its extensive bottoms afford a pleasent looking Country.    we Saw a Great number of Curloos, Some Crains, Ducks, prarie cocks, and Several Species of Sparrows common to the praries.

                  <em class="hi">Thursday 1st May,</em> 1806.    Some rain fell during the night, and the morning continues cloudy. We set out early and travelled up the branch, which is a fine stream about twenty yards wide, with some cottonwood, birch and willows on its banks. One of four hunters, who went forward very early this morning, returned at noon with a beaver he had killed; other game is scarce. We then halted to dine, where the road forks, one going up the branch an east course, and the other north towards the large river. <a href="#n32050109" id="ln32050109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Here our Indians differed in opinion with respect to the best road to be taken.

We travelled about twenty-five miles, and encamped without any of the natives, except our guide, who generally keeps with the hunters, one of whom <a href="#n32050110" id="ln32050110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> killed a deer this evening.
