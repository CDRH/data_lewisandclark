We had a heavy dew this morning which is a remarkable event. <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Fraizer</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a> still continue their opperation of sewing the skins together.
