            <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
            <p>This publication was stimulated by plans for "The Nature of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
on the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>," a symposium and associated art exhibition coinciding
with the bicentennial celebration of the 1804&#x96;6 <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition,
to be held in <span class="tei_name">Lincoln</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, during the spring of 2004. The art exhibition
is being sponsored primarily by the University of Nebraska's Center for Great
Plains Studies, to which all royalties for this publication have been assigned.
The author expresses his deepest appreciation to Reece Summers, curator of
the Great Plains Art Center, who first suggested the project, to Gary Moulton,
whose monumental work on the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> papers made it feasible, and
to James Stubbendieck, director of the Center for Great Plains Studies, who
strongly urged that the plants of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> be included in the project's
coverage.</p>
