The white, the deep and plale red grizzle, the dark bron grizzle, and all those which had the extremities of the hair of a white or frosty colour without regard to the colour of the ground of the poil, they designated Hoh-host and assured us that they were the same with the white bear, that they ascosiated together, were very vicisious, never climbed the trees, and had much longer nails than the others.    the black skins, those which were black with a number of intire white hairs intermixed, the black with a white breast, the uniform bey, brown and light redish brown, they designated the Yâck-kâh;—said that they climbed the trees, had short nails and were not vicious, that they could pursue them and kill them with safety, they also affirmed that they were much smaller than the white bear.

I think this a distinct speceis from the common black bear, because we never find the latter of any other colour than an uniform black, and also that the poil of this bear is much finer thicker and longer with a greater proportion of fur mixed with the hair, in other ispects they are much the same.—    This evening <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">Joseph</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">R.

About noon a deer was seen swimming the river and some of our men killed it. Our canoe still lies under water at the opposite shore, but we have a small Indian canoe, that serves to cross in. In the afternoon the two men came from the village with some of the natives, and one of our old stock of horses, which is the last, except the two which they assure us the old <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Snake</a> guide took.
