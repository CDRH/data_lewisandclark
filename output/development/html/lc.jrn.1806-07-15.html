Dispatched <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> early this morning to the lower part of portage in order to learn whether the Cash and white perogue remained untouched or in what state they were.    the men employed in drying the meat, dressing deerskins and preparing for the reception of the canoes.    at 1 P. M. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> returned without the horses and reported that after a diligent surch of 2 days he had discovered where the horses had passed <a class="regularization" title="Dearborn River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dearborn%20River">Dearborn's river</a> at which place there were 15 lodges that had been abandoned about the time our horses were taken; he pursued the tracks of a number of horses from these lodges to the road which we had traveled over the mountains which they struck about 3 ms. South of our encampment of the 7th inst. and had pursued this road Westwardly; I have no doubt but they are a party of the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">Tushapahs</a> who have been on a buffaloe hunt. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> informed that there camp was in a small bottom on the river of about 5 acres inclosed by the steep and rocky and lofty clifts of the river and that so closely had they kept themselves and horses within this little spot that there was not a track to be seen of them within a quarter of a mile of that place.    every spire of grass was eaten up by their horses near their camp which had the appearance of their having remained here some time.    his horse being much fatiegued with the ride he had given him and finding that the indians had at least 2 days the start of him thought it best to return.    his safe return has releived me from great anxiety. I had already settled it in my mind that a whitebear had killed him and should have set out tomorrow in surch of him, and if I could not find him to continue my rout to <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Maria's river</a>. I knew that if he met with a bear in the plains even he would attack him.    and that if any accedent should happen to seperate him from his horse in that situation the chances in favour of his being killed would be as 9 to 10. I felt so perfectly satisfyed that he had returned in safety that I thought but little of the horses although they were seven of the best I had.    this loss great as it is, is not intirely irreparable, or at least dose not defeat my design of exploring <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Maria's river</a>. I have yet 10 horses remaining, two of the best and two of the worst of which I leave to assist the party in taking the canoes and baggage over the portage and take the remaining 6 with me; these are but indifferent horses most of them but I hope they may answer our purposes. I shall leave three of my intended party, (viz ) <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazier</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Werner, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Werner%2C%20William">Werner</a>, and take the <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph and Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph%20and%20Reubin">two Feildses</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a>.    by having two spare horses we can releive those we ride.    having made this arrangement I gave orders for an early departure in the morning, indeed I should have set out instantly but <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> road one of the horses which I intend to take and has not yet returned.    a little before dark <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> returned with his musquet broken off at the breech, <a href="#n37071504" id="ln37071504" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and informed me that on his arrival at <a class="regularization" title="Box Elder Creek (Willow Run)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Box%20Elder%20Creek%20%28Willow%20Run%29">willow run</a> [<em class="hi">NB?: on the portage</em>] he had approached a white bear within ten feet without discover him the bear being in the thick brush, the horse took the allarm and turning short threw him immediately under the bear; this animal raised himself on his hinder feet for battle, and gave him time to recover from his fall which he did in an instant and with his clubbed musquet he struck the bear over the head and cut him with the guard of the gun <a href="#n37071505" id="ln37071505" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and broke off the breech, the bear stunned with the stroke fell to the ground and began to scratch his head with his feet; this gave <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> time to climb a willow tree which was near at hand and thus fortunately made his escape.    the bear waited at the foot of the tree untill late in the evening before he left him, when <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> ventured down and caught his horse which had by this time strayed off to the distance of 2 ms. and returned to camp.    these bear are a most tremenduous animal; it seems that the hand of providence has been most wonderfully in our favor with rispect to them, or some of us would long since have fallen a sacrifice to their farosity.    there seems to be a sertain fatality attatched to the neighbourhood of these falls, for there is always a chapter of accedents prepared for us during our residence at them.    the musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist; for my own part I am confined by them to my bier at least ¾ths of my time.    my dog even howls with the torture he experiences from them, they are always most insupportable, they are so numerous that we frequently get them in our thrats as we breath.—

                  <em class="hi">Tuesday 15th.</em>    We had pleasant weather. One of our men <a href="#n37071528" id="ln37071528" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a> started to go down to the other end of the portage, to see if the periogue was safe, which we had left there; and, in the afternoon, the man <a href="#n37071529" id="ln37071529" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> who had gone after the horses returned unsuccessful; but as he saw some fresh Indian signs he supposes they were stolen and taken back over the dividing ridge. <a href="#n37071530" id="ln37071530" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>

The blow, however, broke the gun and rendered it useless; and the bear watched him about three hours and went away; when he came down, caught his horse about two miles distant, and returned to camp. These bears are very numerous in this part of the country and very dangerous, as they will attack a man every oportunity.
