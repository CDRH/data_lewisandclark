                  <span class="italic">Saturday 13th.</span>    We had a pleasant morning after some rain that fell yesterday, and again proceeded on early with unfavourable wind. At 10, we halted to hunt, staid about three hours and killed four deer. We then continued our voyage to sun set and encamped. We had a few musketoes, but they were not so bad as we had found them higher up the river.
