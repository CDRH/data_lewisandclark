            <h3>ONE. Beginner's Luck</h3>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
Luck! It began for <span class="tei_name">Captain Meriwether Lewis</span>, paymaster of the First Infantry Regiment, United States Army, when he reached his regimental headquarters in <span class="tei_name">Pittsburgh</span> on March 5, 1801, after a rough trip from <span class="tei_name">Detroit</span>, and found in his mail a letter from <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>, recently elected president of the United States.</p>
               <p>
His thin, long-nosed face must have shown his mingled delight and astonishment. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> needed a private secretary with unusual qualifications. "Your knolege of the Western country," he wrote, "of the army and of all it's interests and relations have rendered it desirable for public as well as private purposes that you should be engaged in that office." <a href="#n0101" id="ln0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Pay would be five hundred dollars a year. Not much even then, but <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> could retain his rank as job insurance and save living expenses as a member of the president's household. Now, that was exciting! <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, who was given to quick exhilarations and, balancing them, occasional deep depressions, dashed off a boastful note to an army friend—he would now be in a position to "inform you of the most important political occurrences of our government or such of them as I may feel myself at liberty to give" <a href="#n0102" id="ln0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>—and then wrote a more circumspect letter to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> accepting the appointment. After settling his accounts, he requisitioned three fresh horses, one for riding and two for packing, and shortly after March 10 started for the new federal city of <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. It was a miserable trip. Flat gray skies, leafless trees, the <em class="hi">plop-suck, plop-suck</em> of hooves in the thawing mire, followed by long nights in dreary wayside inns.</p>
               <p>
Some of the phrases in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> letter kept returning to puzzle him. Knowledge of the Western country, of the army and all its interests and relations . . . He knew army procedures and could get along in the wilderness, but surely there was nothing in that to command national interest. Indian affairs? Hardly. The tribes of the Northwest had been quiet since their crushing defeat at Fallen Timbers in 1794 by <span class="tei_name">General Anthony Wayne</span>. Military defense? 
That seemed just as unlikely. British fur traders were no longer occupying posts on American soil and stirring up trouble. Another tension had ended in 1795 when <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> had opened the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> to the flatboats of the pioneers surging across the <span class="tei_name">Allegheny Mountains</span>. The undeclared naval war with revolutionary <span class="tei_name">France</span> was winding down. Peace, in short, seemed assured for many years.</p>
               <p>
Yet <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wanted his special talents. Strange, strange. Well, he'd learn eventually. On he plodded, losing still more time because one of his horses went lame.</p>
               <p>
He reached <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> shortly after April 1, to find that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had departed for a short rest at his home, <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span>, in <span class="tei_name">Albemarle County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>. He had left behind, in the leaky, unfinished hull of the President's House (now called the White House), a steward, a housekeeper, and three servants whose chief responsibility, until <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> returned, would be taking care of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>. <a href="#n0103" id="ln0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Gratifying enough after a winter on the Northern frontier. Yet probably <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> would rather have gone south, too, for <span class="tei_name">Albemarle County</span> was home to him as well as to the president.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> plantation, Locust Hill, named for the big locust trees that sheltered the main buildings, was only eight or nine miles from <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span>. <span class="tei_name">Meriwether</span> had been born there August 18, 1774, the second child and first son of <span class="tei_name">William</span> and <span class="tei_name">Lucy Meriwether Lewis</span>. He scarcely remembered his father, for <span class="tei_name">William Lewis</span>, a lieutenant in the Continental Army, had died in November 1779 from injuries and exposure suffered when his horse fell in an icy stream while he was homeward bound on leave.</p>
               <p>
The death left <span class="tei_name">Lucy</span> with three small children to raise, a thousand-acre plantation to manage, additional lands in the wilderness to fret about, and sharp worries over British raiders in the vicinity. She solved the problems in part by marrying, six months after her husband's death, another army officer and a man she had known for some time, <span class="tei_name">Captain John Marks</span>. By him she bore two more children.</p>
               <p>
In 1784 a friend of <span class="tei_name">Marks's</span> persuaded him and his family to join a speculative land rush to the <span class="tei_name">Broad River</span> in the wilds of northern <span class="tei_name">Georgia</span>. There is no direct evidence that young <span class="tei_name">Meriwether</span> did not get along with the stepfather who had twice changed his life. Still, he became, during those years, a moody lad who often went alone into the woods with his dogs, frequently at night to hunt raccoons and opossums. He had an eye for plants and one way or 
another taught himself a good deal about the vegetation he encountered. His mother probably encouraged him. She was a noted herb doctor, and it is not hard to imagine them going into the forest together on collecting trips.</p>
               <p>
Almost certainly <span class="tei_name">Lucy Marks</span> taught her children the rudiments of writing, reading, and doing sums. Within three years, however, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether</span> had surpassed his mother's capabilities and those of the neighborhood schools. Whether at her urging or his, he was sent back to Locust Hill in 1787. For a little more than two years he attended a sequence of schools run by impoverished divines. The uncles who were acting as his guardians then set him to work 
on the plantation at the age of fifteen or so. It was an exacting practical education—learning to oversee the slaves who performed the labor in the almost self-sufficient plantation. Herding, butchering, milling, planting; spinning thread and making clothes; erecting buildings and fences; extemporizing repairs, hauling. Setting up goals and schedules. Keeping accounts. Learning the jargon of the neighboring planters who stopped by to trade news.</p>
               <p>
After Marks died either late in 1791 or early in 1792, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether</span> went to <span class="tei_name">Georgia</span> and brought the family back to Locust Hill, using for the journey a carriage said to have been built by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> slaves at <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span>. <a href="#n0104" id="ln0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Apparently he stayed restless, however, and if <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span> is to be believed, he tried to seize the first big opportunity for adventure that came his way.</p>
               <p>
The circumstances are suggested in a letter <span class="tei_name">Caspar Wistar</span>, a professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote to the American botanist <span class="tei_name">Moses Marshall</span>. <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wistar</span> said, and "some other gentlemen," mostly members of the American Philosophical Society, were proposing to raise a prize of one 
thousand guineas to be awarded to anyone who, after following the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> to its source, brought back proof that he had continued to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. <a href="#n0105" id="ln0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Years later, on August 18, 1813, the anniversary of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> birth and four years after his death by suicide, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, then seventy, wrote a short memoir of the young man's life. In it he stated that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, who in 1792 had been stationed in <span class="tei_name">Charlottesville</span>, <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>, on recruiting service for the army, somehow learned of the transcontinental proposal and "warmly solicited me to obtain for him the execution of that object." <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> declined, implying the venture was too dangerous for a youth of eighteen. <a href="#n0106" id="ln0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
There are problems with this recollection. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had not yet joined the army in 1792 and would not be stationed in <span class="tei_name">Charlottesville</span> until 1798. Donald Jackson, who has studied the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition as deeply as anyone, is inclined to believe the aging <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> made a mistake and the episode may, in fact, never have occurred. Certainly there is no mention of it in any other surviving document. <a href="#n0107" id="ln0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Be that as it may, another candidate soon appeared. This was the highly trained French botanist, <span class="tei_name">André Michaux</span>, aged forty-six. <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> had been in the United States since 1785, searching for useful plants he could introduce into <span class="tei_name">France</span>. He established one nursery near <span class="tei_name">Charleston</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Carolina</span>, and another at <span class="tei_name">Hackensack</span>, <span class="tei_name">New Jersey</span>, and stocked them with specimens he found in the mountains of the <span class="tei_name">Carolinas</span> and the hazardous swamps of <span class="tei_name">Florida</span>. In 1792 he traveled with <span class="tei_name">Montreal</span> fur traders into the harsh lands near the southern tip of <span class="tei_name">Hudson Bay</span>. In <span class="tei_name">Montreal</span>, quite possibly, he learned that <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span> of the North West Company had just passed through the city on an exciting errand—crossing <span class="tei_name">Canada</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> by canoe in order to show that far western trading posts could be supplied from harbors on the distant coast.</p>
               <p>
The thought was bound to stir a man of <span class="tei_name">Michaux's</span> temperament. And though there is no evidence to prove this, he may well have heard of the thousand-guinea prize from his fellow botanist, <span class="tei_name">Moses Marshall</span>. In any event he applied to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> for the position.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>: we need to digress in order to place his interest in perspective. Heritage, predilections, and circumstances all inclined him that way, though he himself never traveled physically more than fifty miles west of <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span>. His father had been a pioneer land speculator and mapmaker. The son had touched on 
the West in one of the few books he wrote, Notes on <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>. While in <span class="tei_name">France</span> from 1784 to 1789 as American minister to the court of <span class="tei_name">Louis XVI</span>, he began assiduously collecting books on the West until he owned more volumes on the topic than any other collector in the world. <a href="#n0108" id="ln0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
That the West would be peopled by Americans, though <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> then owned almost all of it, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had no doubt. Even during the Revolution, citizens of the eastern regions and immigrants from Europe had persisted in crossing the <span class="tei_name">Alleghenies</span> in defiance of violent Indian opposition. When the war ended, the stream became a flood. In 1785, for a single instance, a thousand river craft, scores of them huge flatboats loaded with entire families, their goods, and livestock, went down the <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span>. Roads split the forests: the Forbes Road through <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span>, the Wilderness 
Trail blazed through <span class="tei_name">Cumberland Gap</span> by <span class="tei_name">Daniel Boone</span>, and a dozen more. By 1800, three hundred thousand people lived in the trans-<span class="tei_name">Allegheny</span> region, as compared to thirty thousand at the close of the Revolution.</p>
               <p>
In <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> fanciful moments the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> disappeared as the boundary with <span class="tei_name">Spain</span>, and the human tide flowed unrestrained. In 1786 he wrote in a private letter, "Our confederacy must be viewed as the nest from which all America, North and South, is to be peopled." Others, stirred by the same prospect, shared the view. <span class="tei_name">Jedediah Morse</span>, writer of geography textbooks, proclaimed in 1789, "We cannot but anticipate the period, as not far distant, 
when the AMERICAN EMPIRE will comprehend millions of souls, west of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>." The poet <span class="tei_name">Timothy Dwight</span> sang, 
"Soon shall thy sons across the mainland roam / And claim on far <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> shores their home." <a href="#n0109" id="ln0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Savants of the American Philosophical Society, of which <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was a member, loved to speculate on what venturesome settlers might find in the uncharted landmass. Did mammoths, long extinct in Europe, still wander there? How far north did the strange llamas of Peru range? Were there active volcanoes, as rumored? Mountains of undissolved salt? Above all, was there a central "height of land" from which the West's principal rivers 
extended like rays—the Red-Nelson system toward <span class="tei_name">Hudson Bay</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Rio Grande</span> southward, the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> eastward, and, interlocking with the headwaters of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, a navigable, west-flowing stream already named "Oregon" by two early army officers and traders, <span class="tei_name">Robert Rogers</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jonathan Carver</span>?</p>
               <p>
Should members of the Philosophical Society foster private attempts to find a westward crossing? Some thought so. In 1783, when garbled rumors reached <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> that a group of Britons proposed to explore the country from the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> to <span class="tei_name">California</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wrote <span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span>, the military hero of the trans-<span class="tei_name">Allegheny</span> West and one of <span class="tei_name">William Clark's</span> elder brothers, that "some of us here are talking in a feeble way of making the attempt to search that country. How would you like to lead such a party?" The offer was too feeble, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> declined. No Britons appeared, either.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">John Ledyard</span> came next. He was a Connecticut Yankee who had been with <span class="tei_name">England's</span> great navigator, <span class="tei_name">James Cook</span>, as a corporal of marines when <span class="tei_name">Cook</span> had visited the Northwest Coast of America in 1778 on his last voyage of discovery. <span class="tei_name">Ledyard</span> had seen how easily sea-otter pelts could be obtained from the natives and then resold in <span class="tei_name">China</span> at an enormous profit. Eager to set up trading posts in the region, he sought backing first in the East and then in 
<span class="tei_name">France</span>. After every financial prospect had failed him, he sought out <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, then residing in <span class="tei_name">Paris</span>. To the minister the would-be explorer expounded one of the zaniest ideas in the history of exploration. He would cross <span class="tei_name">Siberia</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Kamchatka Peninsula</span> and embark for <span class="tei_name">Alaska</span> on a Russian fur ship. From there he would walk to the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>, buoyed by two large hunting dogs, an Indian peace pipe, and a hatchet for chopping firewood. What he 
hoped to achieve by the incredible effort, beyond publicity and material for another book, is impossible to say.</p>
               <p>
There was no chance he could succeed. "He has too much imagination," <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wrote, and added wistfully that if he should get through, "he will give us new, curious &amp; useful information." <a href="#n0110" id="ln0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> On <span class="tei_name">Ledyard's</span> behalf he wrote the empress of <span class="tei_name">Russia</span> for a passport. She refused it; the notion, one of her officers explained, was wholly chimerical. Grimly <span class="tei_name">Ledyard</span> went ahead anyway and came within seven hundred miles of <span class="tei_name">the Pacific</span> before he was arrested and dragged back.</p>
               <p>
Now hardly five years later, here was <span class="tei_name">André Michaux</span>, eager for fame and a thousand guineas. Embarrassed—apparently the talk of the prize had been only talk—a few members of the Philosophical Society scrambled to rectify matters. On January 22, 1793, they drew up an agreement about payments: one-fourth down and other installments according to the explorer's progress. Simultaneously they set about trying to raise the necessary funds. <a href="#n0111" id="ln0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The arrival of Citizen <span class="tei_name">Edmond Charles Genet</span>, <span class="tei_name">France's</span> new minister to the United States, at <span class="tei_name">Charleston</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Carolina</span>, on April 8, 1793, put a severe crimp in the program. By then it was known in America that <span class="tei_name">France</span> had just abolished the monarchy and war had broken out again between that country and most of the rest of Europe. <span class="tei_name">Genet's</span> assignment was to stir up trouble in the New World for <span class="tei_name">France's</span> principal enemies by outfitting privateers in American harbors to prey on British shipping and by forming an army of insurgents to attack Spanish Louisiana.</p>
               <p>
The reception <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> and the pro-British Federalists in the cabinet granted <span class="tei_name">Genet</span>, who reached <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> on April 22, was noticeably cool. The Francophile <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, then serving as secretary of state, was more amiable. He listened to the schemer's bombast and, although the Frenchman was already in contact with <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span>, went ahead with plans for the exploration. He drew up, under the date of April 30, detailed instructions, the main one of which was for <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> to "seek for &amp; pursue that route which shall form the shortest &amp; most convenient communication between the higher parts of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> &amp; the <span class="tei_name">Pacific ocean</span>." Another society member was appointed to collect the first installment of the subscriptions specified in the agreement. Results are suggestive. Only twenty persons paid up. Amounts ranged from $2.00 to $25.00 from <span class="tei_name">George Washington</span>, who had subscribed the previous January. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> paid $12.50, as did his enemy <span class="tei_name">Alexander Hamilton</span>. Total: $128.25. <a href="#n0112" id="ln0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Hardly enough for crossing the continent (he surely planned to take a crew along), and it is difficult to suppose that <span class="tei_name">France's</span> flagrant breaches of neutrality did not help account for the shortage.</p>
               <p>
On July 15, 1793, <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> started West to further <span class="tei_name">Genet's</span> plans, not the Philosophical Society's. It was not a fruitful trip. On <span class="tei_name">Washington's</span> demand, the French government recalled <span class="tei_name">Genet</span>, <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> drifted back to <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span>, and the disturbance lost its punch, although <span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span>, whom <span class="tei_name">Genet</span> had commissioned "Major General of the Independent and Revolutionary Legion of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>," kept fussing with it well into 1794. <a href="#n0113" id="ln0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The episode left scars, for it exacerbated the feuding between Federalists and Antifederalists (Jeffersonian Republicans) in Congress and in the cabinet. Weary of turmoil, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> resigned as secretary of state on December 31, 1793, and returned home to restore his neglected plantation and to resume work on his domed, pillared, airy mansion. He would not return officially to the capital at <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> until he challenged <span class="tei_name">John Adams</span> for the presidency in 1796.</p>
               <p>
To jump ahead: In those days voters cast their ballots for electors pledged to the presidentail candidate of one party or the other. Those chosen then met in <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> (later in <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>) and voted according to their pledges. The man who received the most electoral votes became president and the runner-up vice-president. In 1796, <span class="tei_name">John Adams</span>, a Federalist, won. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, a Republican, became his puntative successor, an uneasy situation. Well, there would be another election in 1800 and <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was determined that then he would be second to no one. That, too, bacame part of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis's</span> luck.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, meanwhile had let his yearning for adventure draw him into military service. The proximate cause was an excise tax of seven cents a gallon on distilled spirits, which commonly retailed on the frontier for twenty-five cents a gallon. Since making whiskey was almost the only way backwoods farmers had of disposing of their surplus grain, the West was outraged, particularly since no tax was imposed on any Eastern product. Antitax riots—the so-called Whiskey Rebellion—erupted in western <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span>; revenue agents were tarred and feathered.</p>
               <p>
To demonstrate that the federal government could not be trifled with, <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>, at <span class="tei_name">Hamilton's</span> behest, asked the governors of <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>, <span class="tei_name">Maryland</span>, <span class="tei_name">New Jersey</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span> to provide thirteen thousand militiamen for restoring order. <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> joined the <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span> contingent and quickly became an ensign, the equivalent today of second lieutenant. The oversized force—a blunderbuss to kill a flea—marched through the brilliant reds and golds of fall to the <span class="tei_name">Pittsurgbh</span> area. The ringleaders among the insurgents fled. Only eighteen protesters were captured and tried. Two were convicted, and <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> pardoned them. In spite of the clemency, the overkill turned many resentful frontiersmen into voters—Antifederalist voters—for the first time in their lives.</p>
               <p>
At the expiration of his enlistment, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> transferred, still an ensign, into what became the First Regiment of the regular army. Either late that year (1795) or early the next, he served for a few months at <span class="tei_name">Fort Greenville</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span>, in a rifle company commanded by Lieutenant <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, four years older than he and a veteran of the ferocious Indian wars of the first half of the 1790s. A strong friendship developed between them, but actual association ended, except for occasional letters, when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> left the service to salvage what he could of the muddled affairs of his alcoholic brother <span class="tei_name">George</span>.</p>
               <p>
Unlike <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> saw no action in the army. He drilled his men punctiliously in the Northwest's dreary stockades and supervised the building of <span class="tei_name">Fort Puckering</span> on a bluff above the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> where <span class="tei_name">Memphis</span> now stands. Then in 1798, he was placed on recruiting duty at <span class="tei_name">Charlottesville</span>, <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>, near his home—and <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span>. He stayed there well into 1799. Certainly he saw the vice-president during that period. They could hardly have been close friends, for there was a thirty-one-year difference in their ages. Still, they were neighbors. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> bought beautifully cured hams from <span class="tei_name">Lucy Marks</span>, and the presidential aspirant would have enjoyed talking to the younger man about the mood of the settlers in the Northwest, and about the region's natural history, a subject that fascinated both. Before long <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> would have sensed that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was an ardent Republican, though most of his fellow officers were Federalists.</p>
               <p>
As the new century approached, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was moved back to the Northwest. Late in 1800, aged twenty-six, he was promoted to captain and stationed at Detroit. Shortly thereafter he was made regimental paymaster, an assignment that involved arduous journeys down the <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span> by boat and through the dense forests by horse. Or, more accurately, it would have involved many such journeys if the election of 1800 had not intervened.</p>
               <p>
When the campaign, the most slanderous in American history, was over the Federalists had been defeated—but two Republicans, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Aaron Burr</span>, were tied at seventy-three votes each. This threw the contest into the House of Representatives. Thirty-six ballots, each preceded by intense maneauvering, were cast before the deadlock splintered, with <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> as president and Burr as vice-president.</p>
               <p>
The triumph came February 17, only two weeks before the inauguration. A whole new administration had to be given shape, and yet <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, ignoring qualified applicants near at hand, took time enough to reach out into the wilderness and hire <span class="tei_name">Captain Meriwether Lewis</span> as his private secretary.</p>
               <p>
For a long time many people have wondered why. Because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> eventually did lead the first American expedition to reach the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> by land, some historians have assumed the choice was in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> mind before the election. <a href="#n0114" id="ln0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The conjecture just won't wash. It is true <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had speculated at length about what lay beyond the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>. It is true he envisioned a continental destiny for the United States. As a private individual, acting generally on behalf of the American Philosophical Society, he had involved himself in three ill-conceived plans. 
But there is no evidence that as a public leader, whether as secretary of state or vice-president, he had endeavored to set into motion a government-sponsored, carefully prepared enterprise.</p>
               <p>
Consider. The Spanish empire was losing its grip. Maintaining <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> even in a halfhearted way was endured only in the hope that the vast region would serve as a topographical buffer protecting <span class="tei_name">New Mexico</span> and, especially, <span class="tei_name">Mexico</span>, rich in silver. But that hope, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> believed, was fatuous. The <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> Valley was filling with aggressive, energetic Americans. Some, taking advantage of <span class="tei_name">Spain's</span> offer of land grants to adult males who would 
embrace Spanish citizenship and Roman Catholicism (no inconvenient attention was paid to the way the "converts" observed their new faith), were already crossing the river. <span class="tei_name">Daniel Boone's</span> family was among them. So were <span class="tei_name">Moses Austin</span> and his young son <span class="tei_name">Stephen</span>, later the "fathers" of American Texas. <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> hoped, of course, that these and other rugged, naturalized Spaniards would leap to the defense of their property in case of invasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> thought not. The emigrants, he believed, would remember their origins and work for eventual annexation by the United States. So why stir up a hornet's nest by sending a government-sponsored expedition into alien territory? Why rouse French and British curiosity: what were those Americans doing? Better let nature take its course. Let the plum ripen until it was ready to fall without friction into American hands.</p>
               <p>
Then why did he hire <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>? The reasons were immediate, pragmatic, and political. Dressed in a dark uniform crisscrossed with white belts, and wearing a cocked hat with an eagle medallion in its front, the captain would lend dignity to the confidential messages he carried. He could serve as a decorative and charming host at presidential dinners—a real need, for <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was a widower and his daughters could not often leave their 
own growing households to help. More important, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was a stalwart Republican. The spoils system of appointing party faithful to government positions had not yet attained the lush growth it would achieve under Andrew Jackson, but it was on the way. The excise tax had provided openings for Federalist agents, and just before leaving office <span class="tei_name">John Adams</span> had created several "midnight" judges. During the expansion of the armed forces while the undeclared naval war with <span class="tei_name">France</span> was under way (1798–1800), most officers had been picked according to party allegiance. Now it was the Republicans' turn. One of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> campaign promises had been to cut the size of the army, but he wanted to be careful not to remove dependable Republicans. <a href="#n0115" id="ln0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, whom he knew to be trustworthy, could guide the endeavor and also work over long, dull lists of postmasterships. <a href="#n0116" id="ln0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>

               <p>
Toward the end of April 1801, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> returned to swampy <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> (population 3,210) from <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span> and, with his new secretary, tackled the problem of making the huge, white-painted sandstone presidential mansion habitable. Its twenty-three rooms were big and cold; <span class="tei_name">Abigail Adams</span> had said it was impossible to keep warm in such a place. Because the Adamses had removed most of the furniture—it was their own property—more had to be provided. An unsubstantial partition was built in the East Room, on the second floor, to provide <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> with two chambers. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had more suitable quarters in the west wing. The unkempt grounds were tidied up and surrounded by a rail fence, but little could be done about the approach to the entry hall; the outside steps and porch were still made of planks. <a href="#n0117" id="ln0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Because the new secretary of state, <span class="tei_name">James Madison</span>, and his wife, <span class="tei_name">Dolley</span>, were temporarily without housing, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> invited them to stay in the mansion until their own quarters were ready. <span class="tei_name">Madison</span> was wizened and sharp-eyed; <span class="tei_name">Dolley</span>, plump, pretty, and addicted to snuff. <a href="#n0118" id="ln0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Both were sparkling conversationalists and lent elan to the dinner parties the president launched as soon as a proper cook had been found for him by the <span class="tei_name">Marqués de Casa Yrujo</span>, the Spanish ambassador. <span class="tei_name">Yrujo</span> was a dashing, handsome, curly-haired cavalier given to resplendent uniforms. Fluent in English, he had married the daughter of that sound Republican, <span class="tei_name">Thomas McKean</span>, the governor of <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span>, and was a favorite of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span>.</p>
               <p>
Though <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, six feet tall, angular, red-headed, and always poised, could have matched the sartorial splendor of some of his guests, he chose not to. He saw himself as the representative of the nation's sturdy tillers of the soil. He dressed accordingly, appearing at his own parties in ordinary clothing, occasionally wearing slippers. The food he served did not match his costume. One diarist, <span class="tei_name">Mahlon Dickerson</span>, who became a close friend of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether 
Lewis</span>, wrote after one dinner that "however [<span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>] may neglect his person, he takes good care of his table. No man in America keeps a better." It should have been good. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, whose salary as president was $25,000 a year, spent that first year $6,508 on groceries and provisions, $2,797.28 on wine, and $2,700 on servants, some of them in livery. <a href="#n0119" id="ln0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Laborers, it might be pointed out, earned, at that period, $10.00 a month.</p>
               <p>
After several weeks, the Madisons moved to their own house, and the president and his secretary were left, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wrote one of his daughters, as lonely as two mice in a church. <a href="#n0120" id="ln0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Did that lonesomeness break down some of his habitual reserve? "Secrecy," according to his biographer Saul Padover, "was his strategy and his predilection." <a href="#n0121" id="ln0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Still, it would be strange if he did not let slip, during that summer, occasional remarks that revealed to his secretary some of his uneasiness about French intentions in the West.</p>
               <p>
The matter began innocuously. Shortly after the inauguration <span class="tei_name">Louis André Pichon</span>, French chargé d'affaires in <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>, told the president that <span class="tei_name">Napoleon</span> was planning to retake the island of <span class="tei_name">Santo Domingo</span> from <span class="tei_name">Toussaint L'Ouverture</span> and black insurrectionists. Could the French government count on American help?</p>
               <p>
The proposal awoke <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> strongest biases—his love for France, where he had spent some of his happiest years; his desire not to ruffle the new Convention of 1800, which had ended America's undeclared naval war with that nation; and his dread, as a Southern slaveholder, of an independent black republic near the borders of the United States. If the spirit of black rebellion spread . . . Chilled by the thought—his own state of <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span> had just authorized the arming of fifteen thousand men as a defense against possible insurrection—<span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> told <span class="tei_name">Pichon</span> the United States would halt shipments of food to <span class="tei_name">Santo Domingo</span>, hoping this would help starve <span class="tei_name">Toussaint</span> into submission.</p>
               <p>
So far, so good. But then rumors leaked across the <span class="tei_name">Atlantic</span> that <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> had retroceded all <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> to <span class="tei_name">France</span>! <a href="#n0122" id="ln0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> If they were true, America's hope of eventually absorbing the vast territory by slow and peaceful osmosis from moribund <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> was ended.</p>
               <p>
Rumor. But as <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> paced his office, talking to his cabinet members and with <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> quite possibly listening, he found it a rumor all too easy to believe. <span class="tei_name">France</span> had long dreamed of reclaiming her lost colonial empire in the New World. The <span class="tei_name">Genet</span>–<span class="tei_name">Michaux</span>–<span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span> conspiracy of 1792–93 had been part of the cloak-and-dagger game. Later, in 1796, the French general, <span class="tei_name">George Victor Collot</span>, had traveled through the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> Valley, studying its topography in more detail than befitted an ordinary tourist. And now <span class="tei_name">Santo Domingo</span>.</p>
               <p>
Plus other matters that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> could not have known at the time, though the outlines soon enough took shape. In 1798, <span class="tei_name">France's</span> lame, shrewd, unscrupulous foreign minister, <span class="tei_name">Talleyrand</span>, had baldly told his Spanish counterpart that <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> could not hold the westward-pushing Americans away from <span class="tei_name">Mexico's</span> silver mines, but <span class="tei_name">France</span> could. So why not let <span class="tei_name">Napoleon</span> take over <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>, together with East and West <span class="tei_name">Florida</span>, and create from them "a wall of Brass forever impenetrable to the combined efforts of <span class="tei_name">England</span> [working out of <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>] and the Americans"? <a href="#n0123" id="ln0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Carlos IV</span> of <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> refused to negotiate—until <span class="tei_name">Bonaparte</span> so thoroughly mauled an Austrian army at <span class="tei_name">Marengo</span>, <span class="tei_name">Italy</span>, in 1800 that the Austrian-Russian-British coalition pledged to subduing him began to break apart. Arrogantly then he put more pressure on <span class="tei_name">Carlos</span>, helped by the Spanish king's wife, who wanted a duchy for her brother's then-propertyless family. At San Ildefonso, on October 1, 1800—one day after <span class="tei_name">Napoleon's</span> ministers had removed 
another roadblock by signing the convention that brought peace with the United States—he promised to give <span class="tei_name">Carlos</span> the Grand Duchy of Tuscany with its bejeweled cities of Florence, Pisa, and Siena. In exchange he was to receive six warships and the territory of <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>, its boundaries only fuzzily known even along the lower <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>. (Whether or not West <span class="tei_name">Florida</span> could be considered a part of the territory would trouble American policymakers for years.)</p>
               <p>
Secretary of State <span class="tei_name">James Madison</span> carried the administration's worries to <span class="tei_name">Louis Pichon</span>. What, exactly, was going on in Europe? The French minister smiled blandly. Why the excitement? Was the United States planning to cross the river into territory it did not own? Not at all, <span class="tei_name">Madison</span> said, just as blandly. He was concerned over the free navigation of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> and the right of deposit at <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span>—rights, granted by <span class="tei_name">Spain</span>, that allowed 
the entire export business of the valley to flow smoothly to docks and warehouses in the southern city. Sailing ships then landed at the same docks to pick up the merchandise for ocean transport. The lifeline was vital. The <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>, <span class="tei_name">Madison</span> would write later, was as important in the American view of things as "the <span class="tei_name">Hudson</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Delaware</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Potomac</span>, and all the navigable rivers of the Atlantic states formed into one stream." <a href="#n0124" id="ln0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Would <span class="tei_name">France</span> observe <span class="tei_name">Spain's</span> customs?</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Pichon's</span> hands described a Gallic spread. How could Mr. <span class="tei_name">Madison</span> ask such a question when not a Frenchman was anywhere near <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>?</p>
               <p>
The maddening uncertainties were still plaguing <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>—and, by association, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>—when <span class="tei_name">Robert Livingston</span>, the new American minister to <span class="tei_name">France</span>, sailed for <span class="tei_name">Paris</span> on November 11, 1801. His instructions were to block the retrocession if it was actually contemplated. If the exchange had taken place he should try to obtain land in West <span class="tei_name">Florida</span> where an American port could be built. At the very least he should obtain a guarantee of free navigation and unimpeded deposit—all without offending the French.</p>
               <p>
Confirmation of the retrocession did not have to wait on <span class="tei_name">Livingston's</span> report. <span class="tei_name">Rufus King</span>, minister to <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span>, passed on the news in a letter to <span class="tei_name">Madison</span> dated November 20, 1801. Two days later <span class="tei_name">General Charles Leclerc</span> sailed for <span class="tei_name">Santo Domingo</span> with twenty thousand soldiers jammed into thirty transports. And <span class="tei_name">England</span>, the last holdout of the coalition that had begun crumbling after the battle of Marengo, signed the Treaty of Amiens with <span class="tei_name">France</span>. At least it was called a treaty, although most observers believed it was a truce only and would end as soon as the British had recuperated. Finally—<span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was back in the field of rumor again—fresh reports said that a second French fleet was slowly assembling in <span class="tei_name">Holland</span>. British strategists feared it was aimed at <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>, or perhaps even at <span class="tei_name">England</span> itself. American informants said no: its goal was <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>.</p>
               <p>
Furious, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> realized he had been tricked. <span class="tei_name">France</span>, it seemed now, was attacking <span class="tei_name">Santo Domingo</span> not for itself but for use as a staging area for further adventures in the Caribbean and, probably, for a push against <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span>. By occupying the city, through which three-eighths of America's commerce passed, <span class="tei_name">Napoleon</span> could make the young United States dance to whatever tune he called. He could push upstream against <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>. He might 
even persuade the impatient American West to detach itself from the Union and thus destroy one of the world's great experiments in the viability of self-government.</p>
               <p>
A grim <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> worked out his responses slowly, carefully, and secretly—secretly lest his political enemies, the Federalists, disturb the country by crying out that his plans were inadequate and that they could do better. The key element he proposed was a colossal bluff that he outlined on April 18, 1802, in a long letter to
<span class="tei_name">Robert Livingston</span>. The minister, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> directed, should convince <span class="tei_name">Bonaparte</span> that <span class="tei_name">France</span> would be sealing her own doom by trying to take possession of <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span>. For the United States would immediately counter by seeking an alliance with <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span> and creating a naval force strong enough to keep <span class="tei_name">France</span> from reinforcing whatever settlements <span class="tei_name">Napoleon</span> sought to plant in the New World—a world that was henceforth to be held "for the common purposes of the United British and American nations." The only way out, for <span class="tei_name">France</span>, would be the ceding of <span class="tei_name">New
Orleans</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Floridas</span> to the United States. (Other letters suggested that in return for those critical areas the U.S. would assume two million dollars in claims American shipowners held against <span class="tei_name">France</span> for damages sustained in the quasi war just ended.)</p>
               <p>
Negotiating with the French while groping toward an alliance with the British would take time, the president admitted to <span class="tei_name">Livingston</span>. But time would be available. The French could not move into the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> until <span class="tei_name">Santo Domingo</span> was subdued, and that, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> predicted, "will not be a short work." <a href="#n0125" id="ln0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Just contemplating an alliance with <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span> was a wrench for <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, for he despised that nation as an insufferable aristocracy. He could not be certain, moreover, that the self-centered Anglos, as he considered them to be, would play his game for him—or that <span class="tei_name">Napoleon</span> would be swayed by the bluster if a treaty did appear. So, though he was hoping to avoid war with his bluff, he had to prepare for war as best he could—still secretly because of the Federalists.</p>
               <p>
One of his long-range plans was to gain, as quickly as possible, title to Indian lands bordering the east bank of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>. White settlers pouring into the vacated areas would automatically create a strong defensive militia and relieve him of the necessity of reneging on his campaign promise to reduce the size of the country's standing army. He also ordered <span class="tei_name">Governor William C. C. Claiborne</span> of newly formed <span class="tei_name">Mississippi Territory</span> to ready other militia units strong enough to swarm across the border and seize <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span> at the first sign the French were moving into the river. Still other contemplated steps included strengthening <span class="tei_name">Fort Adams</span>, which overlooked the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> just north of the point where West <span class="tei_name">Florida's</span> northern boundary touched the river, and the building of an entirely new fort at <span class="tei_name">Cahokia</span>, across the stream from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. <a href="#n0126" id="ln0126" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
So much for a French invasion. But what of the powder keg he was proposing to cuddle up to—<span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span>? Its redoubtable fur traders, turned out of their posts south of the <span class="tei_name">Great Lakes</span>, were finding rich new sources of beaver in what is now the <span class="tei_name">Minnesota</span>-<span class="tei_name">Iowa</span> region and along the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> had not been able to check the trespasses, though its governors in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> had tried after a fashion, but the French would have more muscle. To get the jump on them in the event of war, the Britishers might come swarming out of the north, take possession of all northern <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>, and then sit back to dicker about territorial divisions.</p>
               <p>
They'd not use an army for the invasion: logistics were too formidable. Small ranger forces led by men who knew the Indians would be more logical. And so small forces were what <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> prepared to meet them with. During the planning, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis's</span> "knolege of the Western country, of the army and all it's interests and relations" surely proved useful.</p>
               <p>
First, the secretary of war, <span class="tei_name">Henry Dearborn</span>, was directed to study means of stockpiling supplies and enlisting reinforcements for the forts along the <span class="tei_name">Great Lakes</span> frontier. But the big gap was in the unmapped wilderness farther west. Certainly it would be prudent for the Americans to learn something about its transportation routes, sites for army posts, and places where the topography made ambushes possible. Even more important would be convincing the Indians that the Americans would make better allies than the grasping Britons.</p>
               <p>
As the talk went on, the president's glance, it can be surmised, rested more and more speculatively on his young secretary. He was aware of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> faults, particularly his tendency to give way at times to deep depressions, a characteristic <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, who knew the Lewis family, attributed to heredity. But he also knew, as he wrote later, that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was "brave, prudent, habituated to the woods &amp; familiar with Indian manners &amp; character." <a href="#n0127" id="ln0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> He had served six years in the frontier army. He knew discipline and as a captain could presumably handle a group of soldiers specially selected for a military reconnaissance in foreign territory. Why search farther for a leader? And at that moment the seed that would grow into the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition was planted. <a href="#n0128" id="ln0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
(Assumptions. Nearly three years later, on April 7, 1805, at the beginning of the final push to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote exultantly in his journal of what had been "a da[r]ling project of mine for the last ten years." If taken literally "ten years" could not refer to the <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> scheme of 1792–93, which he supposedly tried to join, but it could refer to his early years in the regular army when he served for a time with Lieutenant <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>. Probably, though, the "ten" was a general statement. As we have noted, a refrain of the 1790s told of an American nation reaching from sea to sea. As soon as the Spanish barrier vanished, and most people believed the time 
was near, the army would take its place in the vanguard of the western surge. Speculation filled the barracks, and that may be what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> meant. But since neither he nor <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> left a word about the actual genesis of the darling project, we can only speculate in our turn. Anyway, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> was still lucky—the right man in the right place.)</p>
               <p>
In spite of the leaky post office and slow communications of the time, no political enemy detected what was up. Smugly <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wrote <span class="tei_name">James Monroe</span> some months later, "They [the Federalists] would be truly mortified if they could see our files. . . . They would see that though we could not say when war would take place, yet we said with energy what would take place when it should arise." <a href="#n0129" id="ln0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The jolt, when it came, was from the outside. On November 23, 1802, couriers raced into <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> with word that the Spanish intendant of <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span>, <span class="tei_name">Juan Ventura Morales</span>, had revoked the right of deposit the previous October 18. (<span class="tei_name">Spain</span> still held sway; <span class="tei_name">Carlos</span> had refused to sign the treaties of retrocession because of <span class="tei_name">Napoleon's</span> dilatoriness in handing over Tuscany.) <span class="tei_name">Morales</span> justified his action on the grounds of blatant bribery and smuggling by American shippers. Corruption existed, of a certainty. But few Americans accepted the explanation. French trickery, many thought, lay behind the revocation.</p>
               <p>
The angry surmise was wrong. Many years later scholars learned that <span class="tei_name">Carlos</span> himself had sent the order across the <span class="tei_name">Atlantic</span> to <span class="tei_name">Morales</span> as a final way to embarrass the French before he signed the treaties giving up <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>. But at the time no one knew this truth. Roars went up for retaliatory measures—meaning, as far as the more jingoistic Federalists were concerned, an immediate declaration of war against <span class="tei_name">France</span>.</p>
               <p>
To keep from disturbing the country more than it already was, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> went about his ordinary business as if nothing untoward had occurred. Privately, however, he pushed his defense measures. One of his first moves was to visit his longtime friend, the <span class="tei_name">Marqués de Casa Yrujo</span> (the Spaniard might be more amenable than the 
French representative who would soon replace him) and ask permission for a small "literary" expedition—today we would call it a scientific trip—to cross Spanish <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> slope.</p>
               <p>
The request, which he had invented to disguise the group's military errand, was logical. <span class="tei_name">Yrujo</span> knew, and so told <span class="tei_name">Spain's</span> minister of foreign affairs in <span class="tei_name">Madrid</span>, that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had long fantasized about the day when America might extend its influence to the South Sea, as Spaniards often called the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. <a href="#n0130" id="ln0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Immediacy had been lent to the dream by the great accomplishment of <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span>, who had crossed <span class="tei_name">Canada</span> to those distant shores in 1793 
with a single canoe manned by eight or ten voyageurs. Since then an account of <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie's</span> voyages had been published, first in <span class="tei_name">London</span> in 1801 and in the United States a year later. <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> closed his narrative by urging the British government to take steps that would place the beaver and sea-otter commerce of the far Northwest firmly in the hands of private Canadian traders, to the exclusion of the <span class="tei_name">Boston</span> seafarers who were already scouring those 
distant, fog-shrouded waters for pelts that could be sold in <span class="tei_name">China</span>.</p>
               <p>
One way for <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> to hold a line on the British would be to strengthen the American claim to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span>, whose mouth had been discovered in May 1792 by the Yankee sea captain <span class="tei_name">Robert Gray</span>. For that matter, <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> also had shadowy claims to the region, based on a handful of landings made along the coast by its own early navigators. Other nations paid little heed to these Spanish pretensions. Still, <span class="tei_name">Yrujo</span> reasoned, they might be of some deterrence if the British, the Russians (already busy in <span class="tei_name">Alaska</span>), or the Americans developed notions of advancing on <span class="tei_name">Mexico</span> through Spanish-occupied <span class="tei_name">California</span>. Why weaken the Spanish position by facilitating the approach of Americans into the region?</p>
               <p>
As for letting a scientific expedition thread Louisiana by way of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>—well, <span class="tei_name">Yrujo</span> was no fool. Whatever scientific knowledge about Indians or geography its personnel gleaned could easily be adapted to military purposes if the need ever arose. Suavely he turned down the president's request.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> remained unruffled. He had done what protocol demanded. Now he would follow the dictates of necessity. He called <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> into his office and told him the expedition would go ahead regardless, providing Congress appropriated enough money to get it started. Inasmuch as the Constitution gave the lawmakers no expressed right to finance exploration outside the nation's own boundaries, he would lay the project before them as a preliminary step to extending commerce in furs. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> should start the ball rolling by drawing up a cost estimate not to exceed 
$2,500. A larger amount might frighten the legislators and would not sit well with <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> repeated statements about economizing. Both men realized the voyage's costs would soar far higher than $2,500 (eventually the amount reached $38,722.25, not counting services and materials furnished by the War Department) but at the time that was not the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> must have felt like a blindfolded child trying to pin the tail on the donkey. He could count on very few givens. For instance, he could avoid paying wages by recruiting army personnel whose pay and rations would continue wherever they were. As far as the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>, army posts would render some assistance in the way of transportation and lodgings. But otherwise . . . what could he draw on, except things he remembered from his experiences as 
a regimental paymaster and from reading <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie's</span> book about crossing the continent far to the north in 1793?</p>
               <p>
Stabbing blindly, the captain produced such items as $217 for scientific instruments, $255 for "camp equipage," $430 for transportation, $696 (the largest item) for Indian presents, $55 for medicine, $87 for contingencies, and so on—$2,500 right on the button.</p>
               <p>
Congress convened on December 15. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> original plan had been to spring the adventure on the legislators during his annual message. His secretary of the treasury, the tall, balding, brilliant <span class="tei_name">Albert Gallatin</span>, though enthusiastic about the expedition itself, talked him out of a public declaration. <a href="#n0131" id="ln0131" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Such exposure would draw the world's attention to the fact that the United States was planning a deliberate trespass on alien territory. Surmise would fly. Would it not be wise to ask for funds behind closed doors? <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> complied and presented a public State of the Union address so bland that the leading Federalist war hawk, <span class="tei_name">Alexander Hamilton</span>, denounced it as a "lullaby." <a href="#n0132" id="ln0132" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
He next placated the angry voters west of the <span class="tei_name">Allegheny Mountains</span> by appointing <span class="tei_name">James Monroe</span>, who was popular in that turbulent region, as special envoy to <span class="tei_name">Paris</span> to help <span class="tei_name">Robert Livingston's</span> quest for the <span class="tei_name">Floridas</span> and <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span>. The negotiators were authorized to offer <span class="tei_name">France</span> as much as ten million dollars for the desired lands.</p>
               <p>
He scheduled his secret message for January 18, 1803. He began it with an indirect approach to another of his defensive measures, obtaining more land along the east bank of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> from the Indians. Some years earlier, he reminded Congress, the government had established trading houses among the tribes. Their purpose was to defend the Indians against unscrupulous white traders. The question now was whether or not the act authorizing the 
government houses should be renewed.</p>
               <p>
He recommended an affirmative vote. Augmenting the trading-house program would create a desire in uncivilized breasts for many items of "domestic comfort." The yearners would realize they would have more goods to trade if they embraced agriculture and simple manufacturing. The need for hunting grounds would vanish, and they would be happy to dispose of the excess acres to the government at a favorable price. The U.S. would then parcel out the acquisitions to land-hungry Americans, who would promptly form themselves into militia units. In that way the country could plant "on the <span class="tei_name">Missisipi</span> itself the means of its own safety."</p>
               <p>
Only a few envious white traders, he continued, would object to this governmental interference with private enterprise, and their losses could be more than offset by extending the fur trade beyond the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>, perhaps as far as the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. The ultimate aim would be to make friends and allies of the far Western Indians while at the same time diverting valuable pelts from the rugged northern routes used by another nation—obviously <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span>, though not named in the message—and bringing the harvest down the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> and thence eastward by a variety of routes. In the process the explorers would gain much information about the continent's geography.</p>
               <p>
In this elucidation <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> did not say a word about military reconnaissance, and probably none was needed by his listeners. Unctuously he finished, "The nation claiming this territory [<span class="tei_name">Spain</span>] regarding this as a literary pursuit . . . would not be disposed to view it with jealousy, even if the expiring state of its interest did not render it a matter of indifference" <a href="#n0133" id="ln0133" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>—a surprising statement in view of <span class="tei_name">Yrujo's</span> flat refusal only a few weeks before.</p>
               <p>
Bemused by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> adroit presentation, Congress overwhelmingly authorized an inquiry whose extraordinary scope 
they could not yet anticipate. From then on matters would rest largely in the hands of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>, mostly because good fortune had brought him onto the scene, with his particular talents, when the opportunity was in the making.</p>
