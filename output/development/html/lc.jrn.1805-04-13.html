Being disappointed in my observations of yesterday for Longitude, I was unwilling to remain at the entrance of the river another day for that purpose, and therefore determined to set out early this morning; which we did accordingly; the wind was in our favour after 9 A. M. and continued favourable untill three 3 P. M.    we therefore hoisted both the sails in the White Perogue, consisting of a small squar sail, and spritsail, which carried her at a pretty good gate, untill about 2 in the afternoon when a suddon squall of wind struck us and turned the perogue so much on the side as to allarm <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Sharbono</a> who was steering at the time, in this state of alarm he threw the perogue with her side to the wind, when the spritsail gibing was as near overseting the perogue as it was possible to have missed.    the wind however abating for an instant I ordered <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> to the helm and the sails to be taken in, which was instant executed and the perogue being steered before the wind was agin plased in a state of security.    this accedent was very near costing us dearly.    beleiving this vessell to be the most steady and safe, we had embarked on board of it our instruments, Papers, medicine and the most valuable part of the merchandize which we had still in reserve as presents for the Indians.    we had also embarked on board ourselves, with three men who could not swim and the squaw with the young child, all of whom, had the perogue overset, would most probably have perished, as the waves were high, and the perogue upwards of 200 yards from the nearest shore; however we fortunately escaped and pursued our journey under the square sail, which shortly after the accident I directed to be again hoisted.    our party caught three beaver last evening; and the French hunters 7.    as there was much appearance of beaver just above the entrance of the <a class="regularization" title="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Little%20Missouri%20%28E-m%C3%A2h-tark%27%2C-Ah%27-zhah%29%20River">little Missouri</a> these hunters concluded to remain some days; we therefore left them without the expectation of seeing them again.—    just above the entrance of the <a class="regularization" title="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Little%20Missouri%20%28E-m%C3%A2h-tark%27%2C-Ah%27-zhah%29%20River">Little Missouri</a> the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">great Missouri</a> is upwards of a mile in width, tho' immediately at the entrance of the former it is not more than 200 yards wide and so shallow that the canoes passed it with seting poles.    at the distance of nine miles passed the mouth of a creek on the Stard. side which we called <a class="regularization" title="Deepwater (Onion, Wild Onion) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deepwater%20%28Onion%2C%20Wild%20Onion%29%20Creek">onion creek</a>
