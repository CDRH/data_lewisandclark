The hunters <a href="#n40090704" id="ln40090704" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> not having come in we left a canoe, <a href="#n40090705" id="ln40090705" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> with directions to wait till 12 o'clock for them; and proceeded on. About 9 o'clock we met with our hunters, but they had not killed any thing; and at 11 halted to hunt and wait for the canoe. In a short time we killed three elk and brought in the meat; and the canoe having come up we proceeded on, and at sunset encamped. The musketoes are not so troublesome as they were some time ago.
