This morning the men set out at daylight to go in qust of the Elk which <a class="regularization" title="Collins, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collins%2C%20John">Collins</a> had killed, they returned with it at eleven A.

The Duckinmallard are the Same here with those of the U, States. they are abundant and are found on every part of the river below the mountains.    they remain here all winter, but I believe they do not remain all winter above tide water.—    a butifull Duck and one of the most delicious in the world is found in Considerable quantities in this neighbourhood dureing the Autumn and winter.    this is the Same as that known in the <a class="regularization" title="Delaware River (Del.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Delaware%20River%20%28Del.%29">Dilliwar</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Susquehanna River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Susquehanna%20River">Susquehannah</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Potomac River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Potomac%20River">Potomac</a> by the name of the <span class="italic">Canvisback</span> and <a class="regularization" title="James River (Va.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=James%20River%20%28Va.%29">James River</a> by that of Shell-Drake; in the latter river I am informed that they have latterly almost entirely disapeared.    the epicures of those parts of the Union where those Ducks abound nothing need be added in prais of the exquisit flavor of this duck.

               <p>
The red headed fishing duck is common to every part of the river and are found as well in the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> as elsewhere; in short this was the only duck we Saw within the Mountain on the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbian</a> waters. they feed principally on Crawfish; and are the Same in every respects as those on <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">the Ohio</a> and rivers in the mountains of the <a class="regularization" title="Atlantic Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean">atlantic Ocian</a>.</p>

The <span class="italic">black</span> and <span class="italic">white</span> Duck <a href="#n28030905" id="ln28030905" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> are Small about the Size of the blue-winged teal, or reather larger.    the mail is butifully varigated with black and white.    the white occupies the Side of the head, breast and back.    black the tail, large feathers of the wing, two tufts of feathers which cover the upper part of the wings when folded, the neck and head.    the female is darker or has much less white about her. I take this to be the Same Species of duck common to the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">ohio</a>, as also the <a class="regularization" title="Atlantic Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean">atlantic</a> Coast, and Sometimes called the <span class="italic">butter box.</span>    the back is wide and Short, and as well as the legs of a dark Colour.    the flesh of this duck is verry well flavored I think Superior to the Duckinmallard.
