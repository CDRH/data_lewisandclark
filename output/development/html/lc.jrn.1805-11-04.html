The Indians here have a great deal of new cloth among them, and other articles which they got from these ships. We got some dogs and roots from the natives. The roots are of a superior quality to any I had before seen: they are called whapto; resemble a potatoe when cooked, and are about as big as a hen egg. Game is more plenty here than up the river, and one of the men killed a deer this morning. At this camp of the natives they have 52 canoes, well calculated for riding waves. We proceeded on, and passed some handsome islands, <a href="#n25110429" id="ln25110429" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> and down a beautiful part of the river.

               <p>
Monday Novemr. 4th    This morning was cold &amp; foggy.    We are now tide way, the tide fell during last night 2 feet perpendicular, and is on the rise this morning.    One of our party went out early this morning on the Island &amp; killed one deer &amp; a goose which was brought to our Camp.    About 7 O'Clock A. M. we set off &amp; proceeded on about 8 Miles, and passed several Islands, which were large &amp; covered with Cotton wood Trees &amp; Priaries.    The River still getting wider, &amp; we then came to where lay a very large Village of Indians, which lay on the South side of the River.    This Village had about 35 Cabbins which appeared to have been lately built.—</p>
               <p>
The Indians at this Village was very numerous, &amp; had a vast quantity of pounded Salmon in their Cabbins, &amp; had about 50 Canoes laying at a landing at this Village.    This village was by far the handsomest of the kind that we had yet seen.    It was situated on a rising piece of ground, &amp; lay along the River.    The bottom land near this place is cover'd with Cotton wood &amp; pine timber, the Soil tolerably good, &amp; the River had a pleasant appearance, being wide &amp; the current of the tide running very gentle.—    These Indians had Cloths of different kinds among them, which they made signs to us that they had got from white people at the Ocean.    Our Officers purchased from these Indians, 2 fat dogs, &amp; some excellent roots, which we found to eat nearly as good as potatoes.    We continued on our way a short distance, &amp; halted to dine on the North side of the River, The Indians in the Village that we last left, sent 2 Canoes loaded with Indians after us, and they came to the place that we halted at.    They proved to be a thievish set of Savages; for after being treated well by us, they stole <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarks</a> pipe Tomahawk; &amp; not withstanding the stricktest search that we could make, we could not find it.—    We proceeded on our Voyage, and passed a number of Islands, lying on the South side of the River, &amp; some handsome bottom land which lay along the River, 〈which was〉 covered with Cotton wood and Oak timber.    We saw 
lying a small distance back from the River, several hills, which were covered with Pine &amp; Spruce Trees, which were very large, The Indians get the bark from these Trees to cover the roofs of their houses with.    We passed this day, 
several more large Indian Villages, which lay on each side of the River.    The Indians appear'd to be very numerous, The Country pleasant, the Soil rich &amp; Game tolerably plenty.—</p>
               <p>
We saw the Indians bringing into their Villages several deer, which they had killed with their Bows &amp; arrows.    Towards evening, we were met by a number of Indians, who were in a Canoe (which was very large)    One of these Indians, could curse in English which he did.    They had a large Sturgeon on board this Canoe.    This Canoe had Images carved on its head &amp; stern, and the Indians had five Muskets with them.    We discovered a mountain, which lay on the North side of the River, some distance back from it.    It appeared to be round, and is called <a class="regularization" title="Mount Rainier" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mount%20Rainier">Mount Rainey</a>.    We are not yet out of sight of <a class="regularization" title="Mount Hood (Timm, Falls Mountain)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mount%20Hood%20%28Timm%2C%20Falls%20Mountain%29">Mount Hood</a>, which from this place appears to be covered with Snow.    We saw this day a considerable number of Sea Otters in the River.    In the Evening we encamped, on the North side of the River, where we saw, Swan, Geese, Brants &amp; ducks in the greatest abundance in the River.    We came about 28 Miles this day, our Course being nearly West.
