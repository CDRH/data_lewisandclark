                  <em class="hi">Friday 8th.</em>    We embarked early. The morning was cloudy, and there was a hard wind from the east. We went about 5 miles and came to a bay 12 or 14 miles wide. We had to coast round it, as the wind raised the waves so high we could go no other way. We halted and dined at a point on the north side of the bay, where a small river comes in. <a href="#n25110808" id="ln25110808" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> We again proceeded on coasting, till we came to a point of land where the bay becomes much narrower; and the water quite salt.

distance we made in a straight line, was not more than 9 miles; though the distance we coasted was above 20 miles.

Friday Novemr. 8th    This morning we had cool cloudy weather.    We set out on our Voyage early.    Shortly after the wind rose &amp; blew from the So East very hard, &amp; the River got so rough, that we were tossed very much in our Canoes.    We continued on our Voyage, &amp; went round a point of the River, &amp; entered into a Bay, or wide place about 7 Miles wide, which continued as far as our Eyes could descern; &amp; we expect that the River continues 
its width to the Mouth of it.    We halted about noon, at some old Indian Cabbins lying on the South side of the River in order to dine.    We saw vast quantities of Geese &amp; Swans in the bend of this River, or bay.    Our Hunters killed some Ducks, which they brought to us.    We continued on our Voyage, &amp; found the Waves running so high, that we were obliged to land about 3 o'Clock P. M, which we did on the South shore, &amp; took up our encampment for the Night.    Our party had to watch our Canoes constantly, in order to prevent them filling, the waves still continuing to run very high.    We found the River water at this place brackish.    We came 24 Miles this day.—
