The morning fare after a beautifull night, the nativs approached us this morning with great caution.    our two old chiefs expressed a desire to return to their band from this place, Saying "that they Could be of no further Service to us, as their nation extended no further down the river than those falls, [<span class="italic">NB: they could no longer understand the language of those below the falls, till then not much difference in the vocaby.</span>] <a href="#n24102404" id="ln24102404" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and as the nation below had expressed hostile intentions against us, would Certainly kill them; perticularly as They had been at war with each other;" we requested them to Stay with us <span class="italic">two</span> nights longer, and we would See the nation below and make a peace between them, they replied they "were anxious to return and See our horses" we insisted on their Staying with us two nights longer to which they agreed; our views were to detain those Chiefs with us untill we Should pass the next falls, which we were told was verry bad, and at no great distance below, that they might inform us of any designs of the nativs, and if possible to bring about a peace between them and the tribes below.</p>

The first pitch of this falls is 20 feet perpendicular, then passing thro' a narrow Chanel for 1 mile to a rapid of about 18 feet fall below which the water had no perceptable fall but verry rapid <span class="italic">See Sketch</span> No. 1. <a href="#n24102405" id="ln24102405" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> It may be proper here to remark that from Some obstruction below, the cause of which we have not yet learned, the water in high fluds (which are in the Spring) rise 〈nearly〉 below these falls nearly to a leavel with the water above the falls; the marks of which can be plainly trac'd around the falls. at that Stage of the water the Salmon must pass up which abounds in Such great numbers above—    below thos falls are Salmon trout and great numbers of the heads of a Species of trout Smaller than the Salmon. those fish they catch out of the Salmon Season, and are at this time in the act of burrying those which they had drid for winter food.    the mode of buring those fish is in holes of various Sizes, lined with Straw on which they lay fish Skins in which they inclose the fish which is laid verry close, and then Covered with earth of about 12 or 15 inches thick. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt Lewis</a> and three men crossed the river and on the opposit Side to view the falls which he had not yet taken a full view of—    At 9 oClock a. m.

Side; from the top of which I could See the dificuelties we had to pass for Several miles below; at this place the water of this great river is compressed into a Chanel between two rocks not exceeding <span class="italic">forty five</span> yards wide and continues for a ¼ of a mile when it again widens to 200 yards and continues this width for about 2 miles when it is again intersepted by rocks. This obstruction in the river accounts for the water in high floods riseing to Such a hite at the last falls. The whole of the Current of this great river must at all Stages pass thro' this narrow chanel of 45 yards wide.    as the portage of our canoes over this high rock would be impossible with our Strength, and the only danger in passing thro those narrows was the whorls and Swills arriseing from the Compression of the water, and which I thought (as also our principal watermen <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Peter Crusat</a>) by good Stearing we could pass down Safe, accordingly I deturmined to pass through this place notwithstanding the horrid appearance of this agitated gut Swelling, boiling &amp; whorling in every direction (which from the top of the rock did not appear as bad as when I was in it;[)] however we passed Safe to the astonishment of all the Inds: of the last Lodges who viewed us from the top of the rock.    passed one Lodge below this rock and halted on the Stard. Side to view a verry bad place, the Current divided by 2 Islands of rocks the lower of them large and in the middle of the river, this place being verry bad I Sent by land all the men who could not Swim and Such articles as was most valuable to us Such as papers Guns &amp; amunition, and proceeded down with the Canoes two at a time to a village of 20 wood housies in a Deep bend to the Stard. Side below which a rugid black rock about 〈the〉 20 feet hiter 〈of〉 than the Common high fluds of the river with Several dry Chanels which appeared to Choke the river up quite across; this I took to be the 2d falls or the place the nativs above call <span class="italic">timm,</span> The nativs of this village reived me verry kindly, one of whome envited me into his house, which I found to be large and comodious, and the first wooden houses in which Indians have lived Since we left those in the vicinity of the <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a>, they are scattered permiscuisly on a elivated Situation near a mound of about 30 feet above the Common leavel, which mound has Some remains of houses and has every appearance of being artificial—    those houses are about the Same Shape Size and form 20 feet 〈Square〉 wide and 30 feet long with one Dore raised 18 Inches above ground, 〈which〉 they are 29½ inches high &amp; 14 wide, forming in a half Circle above <a href="#n24102407" id="ln24102407" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>    those houses were Sunk into the earth Six feet, the roofs of them was Supported by a ridge pole resting on three Strong pieces of Split timber thro' one of which the dore was cut 〈on which〉 that and the walls 〈which〉 the top of which was just above ground Suported a certain number of Spars which are Covered with the Bark of the white Ceadar, or <span class="italic">Arber Vitea;</span> and the whole attached and Secured by the fibers of the Cedar.    the eaves at or near the earth, the gable ends and Side walls are Secured with Split boards which is Seported on iner Side with Strong pieces of timber under the eves &amp;c.    to keep those pieces errect &amp; the earth from without pressing in the boards, Suported by Strong posts at the Corners to which those poles were attached to give aditional Strength, Small openings were left [<span class="italic">NB: in the roof</span>] above the ground, for the purpose, as I conjectured, of deschargeing Their arrows at a besieging enimey; Light is admited Thro an opening at top which also Serves for the Smoke to pass through.    one half of those houses is apropriated for the Storeing away Dried &amp; pounded fish which is the principal food The other part next the dore is the part occupied by the nativs who have beds raised on either Side, with a fire place in the center of this Space each house appeared to be occupied by about three families; that part which is apropriated for fish was crouded with that article, and a fiew baskets of burries—    I dispatched a Sufficent number of the good Swimers back for the 2 canoes above the last rapid and with 2 men walked down three miles to examine the river Over a bed of rocks, which the water at verry high fluds passes over, on those rocks I Saw Several large Scaffols on which the Indians dry fish; as this is out of Season the poles on which they dry those fish are tied up verry Securely in large bundles and put upon the Scaffolds, I counted 107 〈Scaff〉 Stacks of dried pounded fish in different places on those rocks which must have contained 10,000 w. of neet fish, The evening being late I could not examine the river to my Satisfaction, the Chanel is narrow and compressed for about 2 miles, when it widens into a deep bason to the Stard.

Thursday 24th Oct. 1805.    a clear cool morning    we loaded up and Set out about 9 oClock and proceeded on down.    the current verry rapid.    we went through a place wher the river was all confined in a narrow channel of about 20 yds. wide high rocks on each Side    the current verry rapid and full of whorl pools    we ran down verry fast, passed Several fishing Camps.    high barron land on each Side of the River.    about 4 oClo P. m. we went down a bad rapid where the River was cut in rockey Isld. &amp;.c.    a Short distance below we came to another narro where the River is filled with high rocks.    we halted and Camped for the night at a village of Savages or red people, which have their houses in our form only they have them in the ground except the roof which is covred with white ceeder bark    Some hewn plank which are verry nice comfortable houses    their flag mats &amp;c.    we bought from them Some cakes of white root bread and other kinds cramberies &amp;c.    we bought a nomber of fat dogs and Some wood for us to cook with.    their appears to be Some timber back from the River.    their has been white people tradeing among these Savages    Saw one half white child among 
them.    Saw also a new copper tea kittle beeds copper and a nomber of other articles which must have come from Some white trader.    we had went only 7 miles this day.    〈this may〉</p>

Thursday October 24th    We had a cool pleasant morning.    We loaded our Canoes &amp; set out about 9 o'Clock A. M. on our Voyage; we found the current of the river running very rapid.    We proceeded on, and passed 
through a part of the River, which was confined in a narrow channel of about 20 Yards wide; having high rocks on each side of it, the Current very rapid, and a great many whirl pools.    Our Canoes went with very great rapidity through this place.    We got through this dangerous place, without any accident happening to us, &amp; passed by several Indian fishing Camps, &amp; high barren land which lay on both sides of the River.—    About 4 o'Clock P. M. we went down a bad rapid, where the River had made channels, in rockey Islands, &amp; dangerous places; and a short distance below that place, we came to a Narrow place in the River, where across the River, was many high Rocks, &amp; several rapid Channels running between them.—    We halted above this Narrow, &amp; encamped for the night at a Village Inhabited by Indians.    These Indians had their houses built, in the same form that we build our houses in the United States with these exceptions, that they were built in the ground, &amp; the Roofs were made, of white Cedar bark, &amp; neatly put on.    They had also some of them covered with hewn plank.    They appeared to live comfortable, they had matts to lay on, made out of flaggs &amp; several other household utensials.—    We purchased from them some Cakes of white Root bread; Cranberries, a number of fat dogs, Wood to cook with, &amp;ca.    We saw some timber here, which grew a distance back from the River.—    We conclude that their must have been some white people among these Indians, as they had among them, a new Copper Tea kettle, beads, small pieces of Copper &amp; a number of other articles    We saw also a Child among them, which was a mix'd breed, between a White Man &amp; Indian Women.    The fairness of its Skin, &amp; rosey colour, convinced us that it must have been the case, and we have no doubt, but that white Men trade among them—    We came but 7 Miles this day &amp; our Course was as usual West,—
