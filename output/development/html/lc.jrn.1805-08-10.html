We set out very early this morning and continued our rout through the wide bottom on the Lard. side of the river    after passing a large creek <a href="#n18081001" id="ln18081001" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> at about 5 miles we fel in with a plain Indian road which led towards the point that the river entered the mountain we therefore pursued the road I sent <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> to the wright to kill a deer which we saw feeding and halted on the river under an immencely high perpendicular clift of rocks <a href="#n18081002" id="ln18081002" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> where it entered the mountain    here we kindled a fire and waited for <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a>.    he arrived in about an hour and a half or at noon with three deer skins and the flesh of one of the best of them, we cooked and eat a haisty meal and departed, returning a shot distance to the Indian road which led us the best way over the mountains, which are not very high but ar ruggid and approach the river closely on both sides just below these mountains    I saw several bald Eagles and two large white headed fishinghawks <a href="#n18081003" id="ln18081003" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    boath these birds were the same common to our country. from the number of rattle snakes about the Clifts at which we halted we called them the rattle snake clifts.    this serpent is the same before discribed with oval spots of yellowish brown. <a href="#n18081004" id="ln18081004" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>    the river below the mountains is rapid rocky, very crooked, much divided by islands and withal shallow.    after it enters the mountains it's bends are not so circuetous and it's general course more direct, but it is equally shallow les divided more rocky and rapid.    we continued our rout along the Indian road which led us sometimes over the hills and again in the narrow bottoms of the river till at the distance of fifteen Ms. from the <a class="regularization" title="Rattlesnake Cliffs" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rattlesnake%20Cliffs">rattle snake Clifts</a> we arrived in a hadsome open and leavel vally where the river divided itself nearly into two equal branches; <a href="#n18081005" id="ln18081005" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> here I halted and examined those streams and readily discovered from their size that it would be vain to attempt the navigation of either any further.    here also the road forked one leading up the vally of each of these streams. I therefore sent <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewer</a> on one and <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> on the other to examine these roads for a short distance and to return and compare their information with respect to the size and apparent plainness of the roads as I was now determined to pursue that which appeared to have been the most traveled this spring.    in the mean time I wrote a note to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> informing him of the occurrence which had taken place, recommending it to him to halt at this place untill my return and informing him of the rout I had taken which from the information of the men on their return seemed to be in favour of the S W or Left hand fork which is reather the smallest.    accordingly I put up my note on a dry willow pole at the forks, and set out up the S. E. fork, after proceeding about 1½ miles I discovered that the road became so blind that it could not be that which we had followed to the forks of <a class="regularization" title="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River">Jefferson's river</a>, neither could I find the tracks of the horses which had passed early in the spring along the other; I therefore determined to return and examine the other myself, which I did, and found that the same horses had passed up the West fork which was reather largest, and more in the direction that I wished to pursue; I therefore did not hesitate about changing my rout but determined to take the western road. I now wrote a second note to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt C.</a> informing him of this change and sent <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> to put it with the other at the forks and waited untill he returned.    there is scarcely any timber on the river above the <a class="regularization" title="Rattlesnake Cliffs" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rattlesnake%20Cliffs">R.

Saturday August 10th    This morning clear &amp; pleasant, several of our Hunters went out early to hunt, &amp; we set out as usual, We now have nothing to live on, but fresh meat, &amp; that poor Venison &amp; Goats flesh, and our men 
seem much fataigued; and find that meat only, is too weak a diet, for men undergoing so much fataigue; but they seem all content with what we can get.    The high land makes in near to the River on both sides of it, We passed 
a high clift of Rocks, which lay on the South side of the River, and Valleys, which seem wider, than those which we passed Yesterday, and the hills lies off farther from the River, Our officers were of oppinion (before <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> left us) that the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri River</a> should lose its name, at the place where the Second fork enter'd this River; which we passed some days past, and where we expected to have found, the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Snake</a> Nation of Indians.    they named <a class="regularization" title="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River">the North fork</a>
