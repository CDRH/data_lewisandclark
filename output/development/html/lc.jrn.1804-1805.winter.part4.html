The following list of mineralogical specimens is found in the Donation Book of the American Philosophical Society (see <a href="lc.jrn.v02.appendix.b">Appendices B</a> and <a href="lc.jrn.v02.appendix.c">C</a>). <a class="regularization" title="Vaughan, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Vaughan%2C%20John">John Vaughan</a>, librarian of the Society, may have copied these notes into the book from an original list by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or he may have taken the notes directly from identifying tags which were once with the specimens. The specimens are apparently the items in box 4 of the goods sent back from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in April 1805, and designated "Specimens of earths, salts, and minerals, numbered 1. to 67." See Jackson (LLC), 1: 235, 239–40 n. 21; <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> entry, <a href="lc.jrn.1805-04-03">April 3, 1805</a>, and accompanying notes.

Those additions are italicized and placed in brackets in this section. The "H" following some items may represent an accession check and may stand for "have."</p>
            <p>
Modern identifications of the specimens are nearly impossible because the descriptions here are so slight and because the specimens have been lost. When Thwaites prepared his edition he called on Edwin H. Barbour, curator of the geological museum, University of Nebraska, to identify the specimens, but the professor had little success. It is doubtful that Barbour saw the specimens so he was at the same disadvantage as we and we are unable to advance identifications much beyond him. Readers are referred to journal entries which correspond to specimen dates for possible geologic references and accompanying annotation.</p>
            <p>
The specimens may not have all arrived safely at <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a> considering that some items have the note "label only." Apparently at some unknown time the specimens were moved to the <a class="regularization" title="Academy of Natural Sciences" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Academy of Natural Sciences</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>, where they were integrated with the <a class="regularization" title="Academy of Natural Sciences" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Academy's</a> general collections and not differentiated as <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> pieces.
