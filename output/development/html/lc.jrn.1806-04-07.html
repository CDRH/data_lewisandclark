I preserved the skin of this bird retaining the wings feet and head which I hope will give a just idea of the bird.    it's loud note is single and consists of a loud squall, intirely different from the whistling of our quales or partridge.    it has a cherping note when allarmed something like ours.—    today there was a second of these birds killed by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt C.</a> which precisely resembled that just discribed I believe these to be the male bird the female, if so, I have not yet seen.—    the day has been fair and weather extreemly pleasant.    we made our men exercise themselves in shooting today and regulate their guns found several of them that had their sights moved by accedent, and others that wanted some little alterations all which were compleately rectifyed in the course of the day.    in the evening all the indians departed for their village.
