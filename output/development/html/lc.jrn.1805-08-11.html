We set out very early this morning; but the track which we had pursued last evening soon disappeared. I therefore resolved to proceed to the narrow pass on the creek about 10 miles West in hopes that I should again find the Indian road at the place, accordingly I passed the river which was about 12 yards wide and bared in several places entirely across by beaver dams and proceeded through the level plain directly to the pass. I now sent <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> to keep near the creek to my right and <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> to my left, with orders to surch for the road which if they found they were to notify me by placing a hat in the muzzle of their gun. I kept <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> with me; after having marched in this order for about five miles I discovered an Indian on horse back about two miles distance coming down the plain toward us.    with my glass I discovered from his dress that he was of a different nation from any that we had yet seen, and was satisfyed of his being a <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Sosone</a>; his arms were a bow and quiver of arrows, and was mounted on an eligant horse without a saddle, and a small string which was attatched to the underjaw of the horse which answered as a bridle. I was overjoyed at the sight of this stranger and had no doubt of obtaining a friendly introduction to his nation provided I could get near enough to him to convince him of our being whitemen. I therefore proceeded towards him at my usual pace.    when I had arrived within about a mile he mad a halt which I did also and unloosing my blanket from my pack, I mad him the signal of friendship known to the Indians of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky mountains</a> and those of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, which is by holding the mantle or robe in your hands at two corners and then throwing up in the air higher than the head bringing it to the earth as if in the act of spreading it, thus repeating three times.    this signal of the robe has arrisen from a custom among all those nations of spreading a robe or skin for ther gests to set on when they are visited.    this signal had not the desired effect, he still kept his position and seemed to view <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> an <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> who were now comiming in sight on either hand with an air of suspicions, I wold willingly have made them halt but they were too far distant to hear me and I feared to make any signal to them least it should increase the suspicion in the mind of the Indian of our having some unfriendly design upon him. I therefore haistened to take out of my sack some b[e]ads a looking glas and a few trinketes which I had brought with me for this purpose and leaving my gun and pouch with <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> advanced unarmed towards him.    he remained in the same stedfast poisture untill I arrived in about 200 paces of him when he turn his hose about and began to move off slowly from me; I now called to him in as loud a voice as I could command repeating the word <em class="hi">tab-ba-bone,</em> which in their language signifyes <em class="hi">white man.</em>
                   <a href="#n19081101" id="ln19081101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    but loking over his sholder he still kept his eye on <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> and Sheilds who were still advancing neither of them haveing segacity enough to recollect the impropriety of advancing when they saw me thus in parley with the Indian. I now made a signal to these men to halt, <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> obeyed but <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> who afterwards told me that he did not obseve the signal still kept on the Indian halted again and turned his hor[s]e about as if to wait for me, and I beleive he would have remained untill I came up whith him had it not been for <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> who afterwards told me that he did not obseve the signal still kept on the Indian halted again and turned his hor[s]e about as if to wait for me, and I beleive he would have remained untill I came up whith him had it not been for <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> who still pressed forward.    whe I arrived within about 150 paces I again repepeated the word tab-ba-bone and held up the trinkits in my hands and striped up my shirt sleve to give him an opportunity of seeing the colour of my skin and advanced leasure towards him but he did not remain untill I got nearer than about 100 paces when he suddonly turned his hose about, gave him the whip leaped the creek and disapeared in the willow brush in an instant and with him vanished all my hopes of obtaining horses for the present. I now felt quite as much mortification and disappointment as I had pleasure and expectation at the first sight of this indian. I fet soarly chargrined at the conduct of the men particularly Sheilds to whom I principally attributed this failure in obtaining an introduction to the natives. I now called the men to me and could not forbare abraiding them a little for their want of attention and imprudence on this occasion.    they had neglected to bring my spye-glass which in haist I had droped in the plain with the blanket where I made the signal before mentioned. I sent <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> back to surche it, they soon found it and rejoined me.    we now set out on the track of the horse hoping by that means to be lead to an indian camp, the trail of inhabitants of which should they abscond we should probably be enabled to pursue to the body of the nation to which they would most probably fly for safety.    this rout led us across a large Island framed by nearly an equal division of the creek in this bottom; after passing to the open ground on the N. side of the creek we observed that the track made out toward the high hills about 3 m. distant in that direction. I thought it probable that their camp might probably be among those hills &amp; that they would reconnoiter us from the tops of them, and that if we advanced haistily towards them that they would become allarmed and probably run off; I therefore halted in an elivated situation near the creek had a fire kindled of willow brush cooked and took breakfast.    during this leasure I prepared a small assortment of trinkits consisting of some mockkerson awls a few strans of several kinds of b[e]ads some paint a looking glass &amp;c which I attatched to the end of a pole and planted it near our fire in order that should the Indians return in surch of us the[y] might from this token discover that we were friendly and white persons.    before we had finised our meal a heavy shower of rain came on with some hail wich continued abot 20 minutes and wet us to the skin, after this shower we pursued the track of the horse but as the rain had raised the grass which he had trodden down it was with difficulty that we could follow it.    we pursued it however about 4 miles it turning up the valley to the left under the foot of the hills.    we pas several places where the Indians appeared to have been diging roots today and saw the fresh tracks of 8 or ten horses but they had been wandering about in such a confused manner that we not only lost the track of the hose which we had been pursuing but could make nothing of them.    in the head of this valley we passed a large bog covered with tall grass and moss in which were a great number of springs of cold pure water, we now turned a little to the left along the foot of the high hills and arrived at a small branch on which we encamped for the night, <a href="#n19081102" id="ln19081102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> having traveled in different directions about 20 Miles and about 10 from the camp of last evening on a direct line.    after meeting with the Indian today I fixed a small flag of the U' S. to a pole which I made <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> carry.    and planted in the ground where we halted or encamped.—</p>

Sunday August 11th    A Cool cloudy morning, &amp; some Rain, We set out after having breakfasted, and continued on our Voyage.    Three of our Men went out a hunting, at where we had break fasted; We proceeded on about 3 Miles, &amp; came to a very large Island, being entirely a Priari, which is 3,000 Miles from the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri River</a>, we named that place <a class="regularization" title="Three Thousand Mile Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Three%20Thousand%20Mile%20Island">3,000 Mile Island</a>, We went up the South side of this Island with our Canoes, and had to hawl them over several Shoal places, We saw numbers of Ducks &amp; Geese in the River.    One of our hunters joined us at Noon.    He had killed 3 deer &amp; 2 otters, which had had left some distance a head of us.    The day turned warm &amp; the large flies became very troublesome.    We continued on, and pass'd several sunken ponds, &amp; low bottoms, which were soft and boggy.—    The Beaver here had cut a number of channels to their houses, along the 〈Shores, along the〉 River shores, and 〈they are〉 were very numerous in this Valley, The beaver at this place, are more plenty, than at any place we have been at, since we entered the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri River</a>.    Towards evening, we passed by a few scattering Cotton wood trees, lying along the banks of the River, and Vallies between 9 &amp; 10 Miles wide 〈and are〉 which were low smooth priaries, with some timber on them.    We saw Mountains, lying a head of us some short distance; which appear very high, and large spots of snow on them.    We came 14 Miles this day, and encamped in a wet bottom, lying on the North side of the River, where we found the Musketoes, were 
very troublesome.—
