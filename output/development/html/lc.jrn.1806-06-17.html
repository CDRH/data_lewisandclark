Tuesday 17th June 1806.    we Set out as usal the morning chilley and cloudy.    we proceeded on down Sd Creek about 6 miles then took up a high mountain.    when we got about half way up it the ground was covred with Snow 3 or 4 feet deep    as we ascended higher it got deeper untill we got to the top of the mountain where it was 12 or 15 feet in general even on the South Side where the Sun has open view but is So Settled So that it bears up our horses.—    here is not a sign of any green Shrub or any thing for our horses to eat, and of course no better for 4 days march a head.    if we could even find the road which is impossable without a guide as their is no Sign of a road or trail here So we halted on the top of this mountain and our officers consulted on what was best to do.    at length determined to our Sorrow to
return to where we might git feed for our horses. So we Scaffelled up all our baggage we could do a Short time with out. Set in to hailling &amp; raining at this time verry cold and disagreeable. So we turned back much against our expectations when we Started    went back on <a class="regularization" title="Hungery Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hungery%20Creek">hungry creek</a> &amp; followed up it about 2 miles &amp; Camped for the night.—

                  <span class="italic">Tuesday 17th.</span>    There was a cloudy morning, but without rain. We early continued our march; took down <a class="regularization" title="Hungery Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hungery%20Creek">Hungry creek</a> about six miles, and then took up a large mountain. When we got about half way up the mountain, the ground was entirely covered with snow, three feet deep; and as we ascended, it still became deeper, until we arrived at the top, where it was twelve or fifteen feet deep; but it in general carried our horses. Here there was not the appearance of a green shrub, or any thing for our horses to subsist on; and we know it cannot be better for four days march even could we find the road or course, which appears almost impossible, without a guide perfectly acquainted with the mountains. We therefore halted to determine what was best to be done, as it appeared not only imprudent but highly dangerous to proceed without a guide of any kind. After remaining about two hours, we concluded it would be most adviseable to go back to some place where there was food for our horses. We therefore hung up our loading on poles, tied to and extended between trees, covered it all safe with deer skins, and turned back melancholy and disappointed. At this time it began to rain; and we proceeded down to <a class="regularization" title="Hungery Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hungery%20Creek">Hungry creek</a> again; went up it about two miles, and encamped for the night where our horses could get something to eat. The grass and plants here are just putting out, and the shrubs budding. It rained hard during the afternoon.
