               <a class="regularization" title="Girty, Simon" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Girty%2C%20Simon">Simon Girty</a> was one of the most hated Americans of his day. As a Loyalist in the Revolution, he led Indian war parties against the settlements of the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio Valley" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20Valley">Ohio Valley</a> and apparently continued the same activity for many years after as a British Indian agent. He may not have been any more active than other British agents, but he acquired among the Americans a special reputation (perhaps greatly exaggerated) for malice and cruelty. From the 1790s on, <a class="regularization" title="Girty, Simon" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Girty%2C%20Simon">Girty</a> made his home in <a class="regularization" title="Canada" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Canada">Canada</a>, and he believed, probably correctly, that his life would not be safe in the United States. There is no other record of his having crossed the border, except with the British forces in the War of 1812. Apparently he judged that a visit to the sparsely settled region along the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>, in company with a party of peaceful Indians, would be safe enough. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> is remarkably matter-of-fact about this encounter with a man who must have been one of the prime villains of his boyhood.
