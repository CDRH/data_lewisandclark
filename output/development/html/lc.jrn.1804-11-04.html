He was a French Canadian, born about 1758, who had worked for the North West Company and had apparently lived among the <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Hidatsas</a> as an independent trader for several years by 1804. He appears, of course, in all accounts of the expedition and in the various biographies of <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, but relatively little has been written on the man himself. Estimates of his character have generally been unfavorable, many historians portraying him as a coward, a bungler, and a wife-beater. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> described him as "A man of no peculiar merit" who "was useful as an interpreter only"; nonethless, his services in that capacity, together with his wife's, were virtually indispensable, to say nothing of his considerable ability as a cook. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> evidently had a higher opinion of <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a>, for he saw to the education of the couple's son, offered to set <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a> up as a farmer or trader, and saw to it that his old associate had employment in the fur trade and government service until his own (<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>) death. After the expedition <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a> worked for <a class="regularization" title="Lisa, Manuel" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lisa%2C%20Manuel">Manuel Lisa</a> in the Missouri Fur Company, then carried out diplomatic errands among the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> tribes for the United States during the War of 1812. He joined an expedition to <a class="regularization" title="Santa Fe, N. Mex." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Santa%20Fe%2C%20N.%20Mex.">Santa Fe</a> in 1815, where the Spanish briefly imprisoned him, and worked as an interpreter for <a class="regularization" title="Long, Stephen H." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Long%2C%20Stephen%20H.">Major Stephen H.

He was discharged in 1839, about a year after <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> death, and thereafter disappears from the record; evidently he was dead by 1843. A probable likeness of him is found in Karl Bodmer painting "The Travelers Meeting with <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Minataree Indians</a> near Fort Clark," which shows someone, perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a>, interpreting for <a class="regularization" title="Maximilian, Alexander Philip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Maximilian%2C%20Alexander%20Philip">Maximilian</a> in 1833–34, when he was probably in his seventies. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a>, August 20, 1806, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Dearborn, Henry" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Dearborn%2C%20Henry">Henry Dearborn</a>, January 15, 1807, Jackson (LLC), 1:315–16, 368; Anderson (CFP); Clarke (MLCE), 147–48; Speck, 96–148; Hafen (TC); Luttig, 135–41 and passim.; Abel (CJ), 270–71 n. 258, 276–82 n. 280 and passim.

In spite of the multitude of words written about her, most of what we know about her life and personality is to be found in the expedition journals and a few other papers of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>.

Many writers have referred to her as the guide of the expedition, but <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> hired her and <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a> as interpreters. Her services in that capacity among the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshonean</a>-speaking people in the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a> were indispensable, while her presence with a baby calmed the fears of many tribes that the party was a war expedition. She did provide valuable assistance as a guide in the region of southwestern <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a> in which she had spent her childhood. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> seems to have had a high opinion of her, as he did of <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a> and the couple's son, but romantic fantasies concerning the two have no foundation in the record. There is some controversy about whether the name by which we know her was <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshone</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Hidatsa</a>, and the appropriate spelling and pronunciation remain in doubt. All of the captains' attempts to render the name indicate a hard "g" sound in the third syllable. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> understood the name to mean "<a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Bird Woman</a>." (See below, <a href="lc.jrn.1805-05-20">May 20, 1805</a>.) On her subsequent life there is also little information. The best evidence is that she died at <a class="regularization" title="Lisa, Manuel" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lisa%2C%20Manuel">Manuel Lisa's</a> trading post, <a class="regularization" title="Fort Manuel (S.

(See above, <a href="lc.jrn.1804-10-13">October 13, 1804</a>.) Certainly <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> recorded her as having died by 1825–28.
