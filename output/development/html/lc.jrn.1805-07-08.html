Clark</a> Determined to make a second effort to replace the notes which he had made with rispect to the river and falls    accordingly he set out after an early breakfast and took with him the greater part of the men <a href="#n16070801" id="ln16070801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> with a view also to kill buffaloe should there be any in that quarter.    after geting some distance in the plains he divided the party and sent them in different directions and himself and two others struck the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> at the entrance of <a class="regularization" title="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Sun%20%28Mah-pah-pah%2C-ah-zhah%2C%20Medicine%29%20River">medicine river</a> and continued down it to the great Cataract,
from whence he returned through the plains to camp where he arrived late in the evening.    the hunters also returned having killed 3 buffaloe 2 Antelopes and a deer.    he informed me that the immence herds of buffaloe which we had seen for some time past in this neighbourhood have almost entirely disappeared and he beleives are gone down the river.—</p>

The day being warm and fair about 12 OCk. the boat was sufficiently dry to receive a coat of the composition which I accordingly applyed.    this adds very much to her appearance whether it will be effectual or not.    it gives her hull the appearance of being formed of one solid piece.    after the first coat had cooled I gave her a second which I think has made it sufficiently thick. The mountains which ly before us from the South, to the N. W. still continue covered with snow.    one hunter also passed the river to hunt this morning    in the evening he returned having killed a Buck and a male Antelope. The party who were down with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> also killed a small fox which they brought with them.    it was a female appeared to give suck, otherwise it is so much like the comm small fox of this country commonly called the kit fox that I should have taken it for a young one of that species; however on closer examination it did apear to differ somewhat; it's colour was of a lighter brown, it's years proportionably larger, and the tale not so large or the hair not so long which formed it.    they are very delicately formed, exceedingly fleet, and not as large as the common domestic cat.    their tallons appear longer than any species of fox I ever saw and seem therefore prepared more amply by nature for the purpose of burrowing.    there is sufficient difference for discrimination between it and the kit fox, and to satisfy me perfectly that it is a distinct species. <a href="#n16070802" id="ln16070802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    the men also brought me a living ground squirrel <a href="#n16070803" id="ln16070803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which is something larger than those of the U' States or those of that kind which are also common here.    this is a much hadsomer anamal.    like the other it's principal colour is a redish brown but is marked longitudinally with a much greater number of black or dark bron stripes; the spaces between which is marked by ranges of pure white circular spots, about the size of a brister blue shot. <a href="#n16070804" id="ln16070804" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>    these colours imbrace the head neck back and sides; the tail is flat, or the long hair projecting horizontally from two sides of it only gives it that appearance.    the belly and breast are of much lighter brown or nearly white.    this is an inhabitant of the open plain altogether, wher it burrows and resides; nor is it like the other found among clifts of rocks or in the woodlands.    their burrows sometimes like those of the mole run horizontally near the surface of the ground for a considerable distance, but those in which they reside or take refuge strike much deeper in the earth.—    Slight rain this afternoon.    musquetoes troublesome as usual.—</p>
