About 10 o'clock the man <a href="#n22092701" id="ln22092701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> came in who had gone to look for the horses, he had found one of them and killed a deer.

In the evening the greater part of the war party came in, and some of the principal men came down to our camp. We could not understand what they had done, as we could only converse by signs. Medals were given by the Commanding Officers to 3 or 4 of them as leading men of their nation; and they remained about our camp. The river below the fork is about 200 yards wide;
 the water is clear as crystal, from 2 to 5 feet deep, and abounding with salmon of an excellent quality. The bottom of the river is stony and the banks chiefly composed of a round hard species of stone.
