               Game becomeing more abundant this morning and I thought it best now to loose no time or suffer an opportunity to escape in providing the necessary quantity of Elk's skins to cover my leather boat which I now expect I shall be obliged to use shortly. Accordingly I walked on shore most of the day with some of the hunters for that purpose and killed 6 Elk 2 buffale 2 Mule deer and a bear.    these anamals were all in good order we therefore took as much of the meat as our canoes and perogues could conveniently carry.    the bear was very near catching <span class="tei_name">Drewyer</span>; it also pursued <span class="tei_name">Charbono</span> who fired his gun in the air as he ran but fortunately eluded the vigilence of the bear by secreting himself very securely in the bushes untill <span class="tei_name">Drewyer</span> finally killed it by a shot in the head; the [<em class="hi">NB: only</em>] shot indeed that will conquer the farocity of those tremendious anamals. </p>
