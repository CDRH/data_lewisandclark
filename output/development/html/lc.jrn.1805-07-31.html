This morning I waited at my camp very impatiently for the arrival of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> and party; I observed by my watch that it was 7 A. M. and they had not come in sight. I now became very uneasy and determined to wait until 8 and if they did not arrive by that time to proceed on up the river taking it as a fact that they had passed my camp some miles last evening.    just as I set out to pursue my plan I discovered <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbono</a> walking up shore some distance below me and waited untill arrived    I now learnt that the canoes were behind, they arrived shortly after.    their detention had been caused by the rapidity of the water and the circuitous rout of the river.    they halted and breakfasted after which we all set out again and I continued my walk on the Stard. shore    the river now becomes more collected    the islands tho' numerous ar generally small.    the river continues rapid and is from 90 to 120 yd. wide has a considerable quantity of timber in it's bottoms.    towards evening the bottoms became much narrower and the timber much more scant.    high hills set in close on the Lard. and the plain high waivy or reather broken on the Stard. and approach the river closely for a shot distance vally above 1½ M wd.    About one mile above <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

Along the river bottoms there is sufficient moisture for soil to develop and for a black or dark brown layer of humus or organic-rich material to form near the soil surface. The Tertiary deposits on the uplands and even the terrace deposits slightly elevated above the river, however, are dry and can form only an immature soil. These soils are not sterile, but produce only sparse vegetation because of lack of moisture. (<a href="#ln18073107">back</a>)</div>
