               <p>
On August 30, 1806, as the homeward-bound <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition swept down the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> near present-day <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, the explorers caught sight of more than one hundred well-armed Indians lining the northeast river bank. Salutes of greeting were fired by both parties as the expedition pulled up its canoes on the southwest bank. But the initial welcome vanished when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> discovered that the Indians were <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   of <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> band. <a href="#n0201" id="ln0201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The captain had hoped the Indians were <span class="tei_name">Poncas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>, or perhaps <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . But once their <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> identity was known, he turned on them with his own brand of invective.</p>
               <p>
Taking instructions from <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the interpreter <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span> shouted across the river that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were "bad people" and that "if any [came] near our camp we should kill them certainly." In a second barrage, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> tell the <span class="tei_name">Brulés</span> that future traders would be "sufficiently strong to whip any vilenous party who dare[d] to oppose them." As a parting shot, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> notified the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   that the Americans had given guns, ammunition, and even a cannon to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>—weapons that would surely be turned against <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> raiders. While most of the Indians retreated in the face of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> bombast, several warriors remained on a hill, hooting, jeering, and proclaiming their readiness to kill the Americans.</p>
               <p>
Toward sunset, one man, probably <span class="tei_name">Chief Black Buffalo</span>, came to the water's edge and invited the expedition to come across. <span class="tei_name">Untongarabar, or Black Bull Buffalo</span>, is known in more recent literature as <span class="tei_name">Black Bull</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> consistently called him <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>. He remained a powerful force in <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> politics and <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> trade until his death in July 1813. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ignored his request, the Indian returned to the top of the hill and angrily struck the ground three times with his gun. "This I am informed," wrote <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> drily, "is a great oath among the Indians." <a href="#n0202" id="ln0202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The expedition's members did not sleep well that night. Wet sand, gusty winds, and an exposed campsite made them uncomfortable. Perhaps the unsettling jeers and curses of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   moved the captains and their men to recall another and even more disagreeable clash just two years earlier with <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and other <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chiefs. A close look at that tense 1804 encounter can reveal much about <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> relations with the Indians as well as the larger history of Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian-white contact.</p>

            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
On the evening of September 23, 1804, as the men of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition rested at their camp just below the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>, three 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   boys swam across the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> to greet the explorers. The boys came from <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   villages along the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>, opposite present-day <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. From the very beginning of their enterprise, the captains had known they would have to face the feisty <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>. Their reputation for harrassing traders, pilfering merchandise, and demanding large gifts was well known among <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants. <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Truteau</span>, whose party had been stopped by the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> in 1794, warned that "all voyageurs who undertake to gain access to the nations of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> ought to avoid meeting this tribe, as much for the safety of their goods as for their lives even." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> conversations in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> with <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Antoine Soulard</span>, the Chouteaus, and especially <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span>, had made them aware of the risks in meeting the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>. The expedition's chance encounter with <span class="tei_name">Regis Loisel</span>, a trader just back from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   country, had added to their information. <a href="#n0203" id="ln0203" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Now the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   boys told of two villages upriver. The captains, anxious to begin the talks, told the boys that their chiefs were invited to a conference the following day. <a href="#n0204" id="ln0204" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
After breaking camp on Monday morning, September 24, the expeditions began serious preparations for the long-anticipated parley. Knowing that the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chiefs would require substantial gifts for themselves and their people, the captains worked through their bales of trade goods to find suitable presents. Among the items selected for the chiefs were flags, medals, and a red military coat and cocked hat. Also prepared for general distribution were knives, small metal and fabric goods, and a large amount of tobacco. Because their <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> contacts had warned them about the often violent tactics used by the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> to control river traffic, the expedition was armed with more than gifts. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> cryptically recorded that he and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> "prepared all things for action in case of necessity."</p>
               <p>
That "necessity" seemed to come closer in the afternoon when <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span>, who had been on shore hunting, reported that one of their horses had been stolen by some <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> warriors. No sooner had <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> made his report than five Indians appeared on shore. The expedition's flotilla, now near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>, anchored in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> while the captains tried to talk with these 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> felt certain that they were the horse thieves and, employing an old ruse, told them the horse was intended for their chief. The American accusations and the fact that neither group understood the other made the meeting confusing and potentially dangerous. After the Indians left, the expedition made its way to an anchorage opposite the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>. An island in the Bad was selected as the place for negotiations the following day.</p>
               <p>
Later Monday evening, after the event of the stolen horse seemed less confusing and threatening, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> went to the island for a preliminary smoke with the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chiefs. They promised to return the missing horse and proclaimed their readiness for serious talk the next day. Once back on the keelboat, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> seemed relieved to report "all well" with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . <a href="#n0205" id="ln0205" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Monday night was a time for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to consider the intricate diplomacy of the coming days. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> general instructions emphasized intertribal peace, trade contacts, American sovereignty, and the collection of ethnological material. But he had a special interest in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . Of all the Indians east of the mountains known to whites, it was the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   that the president singled out for the explorers' particular attention. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> concern with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   was based on his appraisal of both their military strength and their economic potential. The martial power of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   nation on both sides of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> was well known. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was equally sensitive to the economic possibilities and imperial rivalries present in any 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -American negotiations. The journal by <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> sent to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> in November 1803 revealed those elements. <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> described the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   as "the greatest beaver hunters," whose pelts were worth "double the Canadian for the fineness of [their] fur and parchment." <a href="#n0206" id="ln0206" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Here was a grand opportunity for American enterprise. Profits from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   fur trade would be an early vindication of the Louisiana Purchase. But, as <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> had observed, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   trade was firmly in the hands of the North West Company and its posts on the <span class="tei_name">Des Moines</span> and <span class="tei_name">St. Peters</span> rivers. If American sovereignty and commerce were to triumph, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   would have to abandon John Bull for dealings with Uncle Sam.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> hoped <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might begin to lure the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   into the American orbit. But that would be no easy task. As he admitted to Secretary of the Navy <span class="tei_name">Robert Smith</span>, the United States was "miserably weak" in its newly gained western lands. In an important letter to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> urged the explorers to pay close attention to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . "On that nation," wrote the president, "we wish more particularly to make a friendly impression, because of their immense power, and because we learn they are very desirous of being on the most friendly terms with us." <a href="#n0207" id="ln0207" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> engaged in wishful thinking when he wrote that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were looking for American friendship, but he was closer to the mark in noting "their immense power." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would have to confront that power, convince the Indians that <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants did not endanger the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   role in Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> trade, and persuade Teton trappers and hunters to bring their pelts and skins to American posts. The captains would have to deal with Indian leaders who clearly understood tribal needs and had both the diplomatic skill and the military force to command attention. With its tangle of economic, military, and imperial interests, the Teton 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   negotiation was perhaps the most demanding piece of Indian diplomacy assigned to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>.</p>
               <p>
If the captains spent Monday night discussing the diplomacy for the next day, then surely men like <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Buffalo Medicine</span> did the same. For the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> bands and their leaders, the political and economic stakes were very high. In the intricate trade network of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   played a dangerous and precarious game. <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   of the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span>, <span class="tei_name">Oglala</span>, a Miniconjou bands traditionally traveled each year to a trade fair known as the Dakota Rendezvous, held on the <span class="tei_name">James River</span> in east-central <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. There the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> met <span class="tei_name">Sisseton</span> and <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   who had obtained manufactured goods from North West Company posts on the <span class="tei_name">Des Moines</span> and <span class="tei_name">St. Peters</span> rivers. The <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands used those goods and buffalo robes in their agricultural trade with the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> village farmers. With <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> population growing, a secure food supply was essential. So long as the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> could control the flow of European goods to the villagers, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   position would be reasonably strong. But if the villagers gained easy direct access to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> traders, the role of the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> as brokers and middle-men would be lost. These commercial considerations required the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> to, at most, blockade the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> or, at least, exact considerable tribute from traders coming upriver. The well-armed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition, representing <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> interests and determined to make direct contact with the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages, was an intrusion that could not be ignored. <a href="#n0208" id="ln0208" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But there was more than economic position at stake for the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> leaders. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would soon discover, they were about to enter the tangled web of band factional politics. In <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> politics the leading players were <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, <span class="tei_name">Buffalo Medicine, and Tortohongar</span>, known to the whites as the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, chief of the largest <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> band, was described by <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> as a man "of good character, although angry and fierce in his fits of passion." His authority and prestige had been challenged long before the advent of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> by the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, chief of the second-ranked <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> band. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>, whose trade goods had been ransacked by the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> and some of his men, described this <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> as "a true Proteus, who is seen in the selfsame day faint-hearted and bold, audacious and fearful, proud and servile, conciliator and firebrand." <a href="#n0209" id="ln0209" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The role of <span class="tei_name">Buffalo Medicine</span> remains unclear; he was called by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> the "3rd chief" in the power struggle between <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>. That struggle for leadership often had unforeseen consequences. When <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> engineered a temporary peace with his <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span> and <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> neighbors in 1803, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> undercut the effort by organizing a horse-stealing raid on the <span class="tei_name">Poncas</span>. In retaliation, <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span> warriors stole nine 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   horses and attacked a <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> village. But the village they raided was <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> and the peace was broken. <a href="#n0210" id="ln0210" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Now, as the negotiations with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were about to begin, both <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> looked to use the talks to increase their own prestige. Playing to the Indian galleries, each chief would try to outdo the other in zealous defense of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   privilege.</p>
               <p>
Early on the morning of September 25, the expedition established a council place on a sandbar in the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>. A canvas awning was put in place and a flagstaff raised. By ten o'clock a large number of Indians began to gather along both river banks. About eleven o'clock <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Buffalo Medicine</span> appeared. Hoping to begin the conference on a generous note, the captains offered the chiefs and thirty <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> warriors something to eat. Not to be outdone, the chiefs gave the expedition several hundred pounds of fat buffalo meat. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> responded by offering the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   some pork. Both sides had now shown the required hospitality and it was time at last to talk. To their chagrin, the Americans discovered they lacked an interpreter skillful enough for this demanding task. The translator <span class="tei_name">Pierre Dorion</span> had remained with the <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   to promote peace between that tribe and the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> unhappily noted, "We feel much at a loss for want of an interpreter." The diplomats would have to rely on "the old frenchman" <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span>, who <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> admitted, could "speak but little." <a href="#n0211" id="ln0211" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
At noon both sides seemed ready to settle in for the speechmaking. After the usual mandatory smoking, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> stood to make a short speech made shorter for want of an interpreter. No journalist recorded <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> words, but it is likely that at this early stage the captain spoke in no more than generalities. The speech probably followed the pattern established in earlier conferences with other tribes in which the explorer-diplomats touched on issues of intertribal peace, trade and American sovereignty. <a href="#n0212" id="ln0212" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>

               <p>
When <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> speech ended, the expedition put on its "traveling medicine show"—a demonstration of martial power and Western technology. This display, with its aim to impress the Indians with American might, had been successfully staged earlier for the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>, <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . <a href="#n0213" id="ln0213" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The performance began with a military parade by uniformed troops marching under the colors of the republic. As the parade ended, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sought to keep the military splendor and political significance of the moment alive by handing out gifts to the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chiefs. Recognizing <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> as the leading chief present, the captains gave him a medal, a red military coat, and a cocked hat. In their rush to gain approval from <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, the Americans evidently slighted the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have been insensitive to the nuances of rank and precedence in <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> politics, but by trying to make <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> a client chief they were simply following long-established diplomatic practice. From the time of earliest contact, European and later American government officials had always sought one Indian chief or headman, thinking he could both speak for and command the entire tribe. But neglecting the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> was a serious oversight, one that was sure to spark trouble in the coming days.</p>
               <p>
While the last presents were being distributed, the carefully orchestrated show was interrupted. The <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chiefs began to complain that the gifts were inadequate, as they had done to earlier traders. They demanded the expedition either stop its upriver progress and remain with them or at least leave a gift-laden pirogue behind as tribute. <a href="#n0214" id="ln0214" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> While the captains must have known that such demands would eventually be made, they seemed unprepared that afternoon to deal with them directly. The niceties of diplomacy and the presence of many armed <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> warriors called for other measures. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tried to divert <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> attention by going on with the military hardware display. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> went through his now-familiar airgun demonstration, charging and firing it several times. Evidently unimpressed, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the other chiefs continued to press their demands. Again hoping to divert the insistent chiefs, the captains offered to take them and some of their soldiers on the keelboat. Once on board, the Indians were shown "such curiossities as was strange to them." One <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> warrior was given a government certificate proclaiming him "the friend and ally of the said states" and urging all citizens to treat him "in the most friendly manner." <a href="#n0215" id="ln0215" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Adding to the general milling about on the keelboat was the decision to break out some trade whiskey. Each chief was given one-fourth glass, "which [he] appeared to be very fond of." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> observed that the Indians "sucked the bottle after it was out. "Amid this confusion the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> made his move both to frighten the Americans and to impress bankside Indian spectators. Feigning drunkenness as a cover "for his racially intentions," the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> became "troublesome." Fearing a bloody melee, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> struggled to get the chiefs back on shore. Those efforts were resisted, and it was only "with great relectiance" that the chiefs and their men boarded the pirogue for shore. Although the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> seemed intent on using the presence of the expedition as a means to advance his own power, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned to land "with a view of reconsileing those men to us."</p>
               <p>
When the pirogue landed, an already difficult situation became potentially explosive. Three young <span class="tei_name">Brulés</span>, who may have belonged to the <span class="tei_name">Partisan's</span> retinue, seized the pirogue's bow cable. At the same moment, another warrior locked his arms around the pirogue's short mast. As the pirogue was being temporarily hijacked, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> moved directly against <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The chief spoke roughly to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, staggered up against him, and told him that the expedition could not advance. The <span class="tei_name">Partisan's</span> actions were designed to test <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, to make him weaken and back down as had previous white visitors. Given the presence of so many women and children, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> had no intention of starting a shooting spree. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have sensed the limits of the situation. His response to the jostling and "insolent jestures" was equally firm. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> drew his sword and at the same time alerted <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the keelboat crew for action. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered the swivel guns readied while expeditionary soldiers around <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> prepared their weapons for firing. Then, as quickly as the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> had created the tension, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> eased it. Obviously fearing heavy casualities if fighting erupted, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> took the pirogue's cable and forcefully ordered the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> warriors away from the boat.</p>
               <p>
Surrounded by warriors with their bows strung and arrows out of quivers, the American captain and the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chief now faced each other. The pointed and angry words they exchanged, passed through a very inadequate interpreter, reveal much about expedition-Indian relations and <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   policy. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> told <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> that the expedition "must and would go on." To emphasize that determination, he told the Indians that his men "were not squaws, but warriors." Rising to this rhetorical challenge, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> declared that "he had warriors too and if we were to go on they would follow us and kill and take the whole of us by degrees." Angered by the threats, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "felt My Self warm and Spoke in verry positive terms." Those terms included a reminder that the expedition was sent by the Chief of the Seventeen Fires, whose warriors could be summoned in a moment to punish the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . And in a burst of temper, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> boasted that he had "more medicine on board his boat than would kill twenty such nations in one day." <a href="#n0216" id="ln0216" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The verbal sparring might have continued a bit longer except for the arrival of a canoe filled with twelve American soldiers "ready for any event." Most of the Indian warriors retreated and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was now left alone with the chiefs and a core of <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> soldiers. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, still holding the pirogue's cable, asked if the women and children might see the keelboat and its curiosities. This was an easy request to grant, one that might allow both sides to emerge with honor and prestige intact. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> agreed and <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> dropped the cable. Determined to have the last word, the chief declared that "he was sorry to have us go for his women and children were naked and poor and wished to get some goods, but he did not think we were merchants, nor that we were loaded with goods, but he was sorry to have us leave so soon." As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men stood by the pirogue, the chiefs walked down the bank for a private council. After waiting some time, Clark approached the chiefs and offered to shake hands. The captain was rebuffed and took that as a signal that discussions were over for the day.</p>
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his party paddled back to the keelboat, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> made one last demand. He and two of his warriors waded out ten feet from shore and asked to be taken on the keelboat. That night, as the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chief and his men slept on a board, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote simply of the day: "Their treatment to me was verry rough and I think justified roughness on my part." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> neglected to add that their diplomacy was being drawn off course and onto the single point of continued upriver progress. The roughness of the day was hardly what <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had in mind by "a friendly impression." The initiative was clearly in <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> hands. All <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could do was react and hope to escape unscathed. And as an indication of the apprehensive mood felt throughout the expedition, the island named "Good humored" was changed to "Bad humored island as we were in a bad humor." <a href="#n0217" id="ln0217" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The tensions of the previous day were not repeated on Wednesday, September 26. With <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and his soldiers still on board, the keelboat sailed about five miles upriver. The shore was lined with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   spectators closely watching the progress of the chiefs and the explorers. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted that "these people Shew great anxiety." With the failure of the bluff-and-bluster tactics the day before and the expedition now moving upriver, perhaps many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   feared they had lost the battle of wits and wills. Hoping to keep the expedition a bit longer, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> asked the captains to land near his village so his women and children might visit the boat. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> agreed, perhaps feeling that more time with the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> might produce a change in the diplomatic climate. <a href="#n0218" id="ln0218" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Anchoring the keelboat about one hundred yards from shore, the captains divided their forces. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> accompanied <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> village while <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> remained on board. The <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chief "appeared disposed to make up and be friendly." The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   village the expedition saw that day must have been an impressive sight. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, one of the expedition's most careful observers, wrote: "Their lodge [village] is very handsome in a circle and about 100 cabbins in nomber and all white, made of buffalo hides dressed white. One large one in the center, the lodge for the war dances." <a href="#n0219" id="ln0219" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> estimated that with about ten persons in each tepee the total village population was eight or nine hundred persons. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> thought that two-thirds of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   in the village were women and children. <a href="#n0220" id="ln0220" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As the morning slipped away and no word came from <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, those on the keelboat "became uneasy for fear of Deception." After about three hours, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> to find <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> reported back that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was well and that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were preparing a feast and dance to honor the Americans. That news was a clear indication of a shift in <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> tactics. If the whites could not be easily bluffed, they might be flattered and impressed by a show of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   hospitality and military prowess. It was <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> turn to demonstrate "medicine" as the Americans had done earlier. Throughout the afternoon many <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> folk made "frequent selicitiations" for the expedition to remain one night longer so that they could "Show their good disposition towards us." Once the captains agreed, they were carried with much ceremony on white buffalo robes to the great council lodge.</p>
               <p>
The scene that night in the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> village made a lasting impression on many members of the expedition. Fires glowed through translucent tepees as women prepared vast quantities of food for the feast. Slabs of buffalo meat roasted over hot coals. In a circle inside the council lodge were seated some seventy elders and prominent warriors. The Americans were placed next to <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>. Directly in front of the chiefs a six-foot sacred circle had been cleared for holy pipes, pipe stands, and medicine bundles. American and Spanish flags were also displayed in the circle. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noticed the Spanish ensign but decided to ignore it. There is no evidence to suggest that the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> recognized the sovereignty of either <span class="tei_name">Spain</span> or the United States. The flag may have been used simply for colorful decoration.</p>
               <p>
The diplomacy of the evening began when a <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> elder stood "and Spoke aproveing what we had done." Because the captains still lacked a reliable 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   interpreter, they were uncertain about much of what the old man said. The import of his speech seemed to be that the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> bands were poor and that the expedition should trade with them, not the upriver tribes. No journalist recorded the American reply, but the explorers probably repeated their usual formula about peace with other tribes and the need for the expedition to press on. The concern for intertribal peace was a cornerstone in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> Indian policy and also reflected the needs of the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants. Because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had learned earlier in the day that there were many <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> prisoners in the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> villages, the Americans saw this as an opportunity to promote <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>-<span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> peace. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called upon <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> to free the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> captives. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> attempt at peacemaking with the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> had been disrupted by the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> in 1803, and there was little reason to think the chief would release valuable prisoners just to gratify what must have seemed the whim of a distant chief.</p>
               <p>
The council reached its dramatic climax when <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> "rose with great state" to address the gathering. Again hindered by the lack of a skilled interpreter, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> understood little of what the chief said. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded in his journal that the chief spoke "to the same purpose" as did the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> elder. It seems clear that <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> was employing his oratorical talents to further the fundamental <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   aim—to keep the expedition from opening direct trade with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and other Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> village people. His speech finished, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> took up the most holy of the pipes and pointed it in each of the cardinal directions. Before lighting the pipe, he offered a prayer. Still holding the pipe, the chief took some tender dog meat and made a "Sacrefise to the flag." These solemnities over, the pipe was passed around the circle for all to smoke.</p>
               <p>
Food was next on the evening agenda. The captains and their men were presented with all the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   delicacies, including platters of roast dog, buffalo, pemmican, and prairie turnips. <a href="#n0221" id="ln0221" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The whole assembly ate and smoked with an air of conviviality until dusk. At nightfall a large fire was made in the center of the village to light the way for musicians and dancers. Ten male musicians entered first. Their instruments were of two kinds: a tambourine-like instrument made by stretching a skin over a willow hoop, and various rattles made by tying deer and antelope hooves on a long stick. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted that the rattles made a "gingling noise." As the men began to sing and play, women "highly Deckerated in their way" came forward and began to dance in time to the rhythm. In this war dance the women displayed scalps and other war trophies belonging to their male relatives. That night such a display was surely aimed at impressing <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> military might. One young man moved away from the players and toward the spectators. In a high singing voice he recounted the daring exploits of band members in combat with their enemies. His words were picked up by the performers behind him and repeated to add power to the whole spectacle. <a href="#n0222" id="ln0222" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Throughout the evening members of the expedition rewarded the singers and dancers with tobacco. When one warrior thought he had not received his proper due, he broke one drum, threw two more in the fire, and angrily left the dance line. The two drums were hastily retrieved from the fire and the dancing continued. <a href="#n0223" id="ln0223" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> The entertainment, "done with great Chearfullness," went on until midnight. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> found the music "delightful," but by midnight <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were plainly weary. Tactfully, they suggested to the chiefs that everyone must now be tired. Taking the hint, the chiefs ended the festivities and returned with the captains to spend the night on the keelboat. <a href="#n0224" id="ln0224" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> left the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> village, they were offered young women as bed partners. For the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , the proposal combined hospitality and diplomacy. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> understood the meaning of the offer, writing later that "a curious custom with the <span class="tei_name">Souix</span> as well as the <span class="tei_name">rickeres [Arikaras]</span> is to give handsom squars to those whome they wish to Show some acknowledgments to." Repeating the offer the following night, the Indians made clear to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that the woman stood for the whole band. He was urged "to take her and not dispise them." Although fully aware of the symbolic significance of sexual intercourse with the proffered woman, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dismissed her. That rejection must have bewildered the <span class="tei_name">Brulés</span> and surely did not foster the friendship and trust <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was seeking. <a href="#n0225" id="ln0225" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The late night entertainment was unquestionably a great emotional release from the tensions of earlier days, but <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported that at least he did not sleep well. On Thursday morning, September 27, both the captains and the chiefs were up early. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> were given, or rather they simply appropriated, the blankets they had slept on. After breakfast <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the chiefs went on shore "as a verry large part of their nation was comeing in" to see the expedition. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> remained on the keelboat, where he wrote a letter to <span class="tei_name">Pierre Dorion</span> and prepared a medal and some certificates for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to use later in the day.</p>
               <p>
About midafternoon <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, accompanied by <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, and the "considerable man" <span class="tei_name">Warchapa</span>, returned to the keelboat. After about half an hour, the captains evidently thought it best that all return to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   village. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> began to suggest they go ashore, the chiefs showed "great reluctiance" to leave. That reluctance finally overcome, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first visited the <span class="tei_name">Partisan's</span> lodge. A crowd gathered outside the tepee as the American and the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> spoke "on various subjects." Continuing his round of courtesy calls, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> stopped at the lodge of a <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> elder and then moved on to <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> tepee. From there <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was conducted to a gathering of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> elders. Toward evening <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> arrived in the village and both captains enjoyed a display of the same dancing and ceremony as the previous night. And once again, on the way back to the keelboat, they were offered 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   women. As before, the offer was rejected.</p>
               <p>
Tired by a full day of talking and visiting, the American party, along with the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> and one of his soldiers, made their way on the white pirogue back to the keelboat. The evening stillness was shattered when some clumsy steering caused the pirogue to slam broadside against the keelboat's anchor cable. The cable broke and both vessels began to swing dangerously. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> at once shouted at his men to get their oars in order to prevent further damage to either vessel. His shouting and the general bustle of men moving quickly in the darkness frightened the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . An alarm ran through the village as <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> spread the word that an <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> attack was at hand. Within ten minutes the chief and two hundred armed men prepared for combat were on the river bank. After about half an hour, most of the warriors made their way back to the village. However, some sixty remained on watch throughout the night.</p>
               <p>
Both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that the sudden appearance of so many warriors was a "signal of their intentions (which was to Stop our proceeding on our journey and if Possible rob us.)" <a href="#n0226" id="ln0226" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> This harsh view of <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> motives was not shared by others in the expedition. Sergeants <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Private Whitehouse</span> emphasized both the fear of <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> attack and the genuine desire of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   to help the endangered vessels. <a href="#n0227" id="ln0227" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> In light of <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> activities before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> coming, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> fear of <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> attack was well grounded. In early September, some two weeks before the expedition arrived, a <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> war party had raided an <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> village, burning forty lodges and killing more than seventy-five of the tribe. There were now some forty-eight <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> prisoners in the two <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> villages along the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>. <a href="#n0228" id="ln0228" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a> In the cycle of raid and reprisal, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> had every reason to think the confusion in the night was due to something more than a broken cable and a missing anchor.</p>
               <p>
But the Americans also had reason to worry that night. Although <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> stressed the sudden arrival of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors as cause for alarm, it was probably intelligence brought to the captains by <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span> that put the expedition on its guard throughout the night. On Wednesday, September 26, <span class="tei_name">Cruzatte</span> had been given some trade goods as presents for the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> prisoners. Now, in return, the prisoners told the interpreter that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "were to be stoped." The value of that information gathered from Indians who saw the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   as enemies is now hard to judge. Certainly it fit the overall evaluation of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   behavior held by the expedition. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> tense lines "we Shew as little signs of a Knowledge of their intentions as possible, all prepared on board for any thing which might happen, we kept a Strong guard all night in the boat, no Sleep" betray both fear of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   military power and an exaggerated readiness to fight. <a href="#n0229" id="ln0229" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and their men had now been with the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   for three days. Those were days filled with isolated moments of trouble and misunderstanding and long periods of friendly visiting and good company. The expedition gathered some important ethnographic data, tried to make its point about American sovereignty, and even practiced, albeit with dubious success, some intertribal peace-making. But on the crucial issue of trade—safe passage up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> for fur traders and <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants—there had been little or no progress. The expedition planned to spend the rest of the year at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages; with winter coming, it was now time to move on. That determination to press upriver collided with the equal determination of the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chiefs both to advance their own prestige and to defend <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   economic interests. In the eyes of men like <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, the continued presence of the American expedition posed something of a dilemma and an embarrassment. Both men needed to act forcefully to vindicate personal claims to power. <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands had come to expect their headmen to obtain gifts from river traders. A chief who could not deliver was bound to have his authority openly questioned. At the same time, faced with a well-armed party under strong leadership, the chiefs feared pressing their demands too far. If there was a bloody incident and Indian casualties were high, the chiefs would surely lose influence. Pressure tactics that proved effective in intimidating poorly armed traders who needed 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   cooperation would not work against a military expedition whose goals went far beyond the ledger book. It was against this background of cross purposes, face saving, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> determination to leave the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span> that the last day of the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   confrontation was played out.</p>
               <p>
Much of Friday morning was spent in a fruitless search for the keelboat anchor. By midmorning, when the work parties took breakfast, nearly all the <span class="tei_name">Brulés</span> lined the river bank. As the captains were about to order the sail hoisted, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the other chiefs appeared. Once on board, the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> leaders began their now-familiar demand that the expedition remain with them. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> noted that the warriors on the bank were well armed with guns, spears, "a kind of cutlashes," and bows with metal-tipped arrows. <a href="#n0230" id="ln0230" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Anxious to leave, the crew made preparations to cast off the bowline. At that moment several of the <span class="tei_name">Partisan's</span> warriors took hold of the cable. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who was inside the cabin with <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, saw what happened and complained to the chief. Evidently fearing that the seizure of the cable spelled the beginning of very serious trouble, and perhaps resenting the role of the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> in the affair, the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chief hurried forward to assure <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that the warriors simply wanted tobacco. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, weary of the constant demands for gifts, refused to give them anything. He ordered all hands ready for departure, had the sail hoisted, and detailed one man to untie the bow cable.</p>
               <p>
At this critical moment several things happened at once. The bow cable, first untied by a crewman, was again fastened by several of the <span class="tei_name">Partisan's</span> warriors. At the same time, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> himself demanded a flag and some tobacco. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> angrily ordered all Indians off the boat while <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> threw a carrot of tobacco on the bank. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> then took the firing taper for the port swivel gun in his hand and "spoke so as to touch his [<span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span>] pride." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not record the sarcasm in his journal but years later told <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span>, "I threw him tobacco saying to the chief you have told us you are a great man—have influence—take this tobacco and shew us your influence by taking the rope from your men and letting go without coming to hostilities." <a href="#n0231" id="ln0231" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also had a "rangleing" exchange with the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>. Violence seemed seconds away. Warriors hurried women and children from the bank. But it was <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> who finally calmed the situation. He promised the expedition safe conduct if tobacco, always a ceremonial tribute, was given to the warriors holding the cable. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> balked at the demand, saying that they "did not mean to be trifled with." Seeing the captains hesitate, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> sarcastically observed that "he was mad too, to see us stand so much for one carrot of tobacco." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> tossed the tobacco to the Indians and <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> jerked the cable from their hands. At that moment the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> confrontation was over. <a href="#n0232" id="ln0232" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In those moments when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was ready to fire, when the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> warriors had bows strung, and when the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> was shouting defiance, it was <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> who showed both firmness and the ability to compromise. Perhaps by September 28 the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chief realized that nothing further could be gained by delaying <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. There would be other parties from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, less well armed, with more goods, and easier to intimidate. Allowing one boat to pass was hardly a defeat. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> had obtained ceremonial tribute from the Americans and had lost nothing in the eyes of his own people. But at the beginning of the final day of the confrontation, the political ambitions of the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> were as yet unfulfilled. His contest for influence with <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> still gave him reason to harrass the Americans. The <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, described by <span class="tei_name">Buffalo Medicine's</span> son as a "Double Spoken man," seized the initiative that day as one more means to gain precedence over <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>. <a href="#n0233" id="ln0233" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> The last minutes of the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> encounter were less a conflict between Indians and American explorers and more a tussle between rival band headmen. In the end it was <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> who engineered a compromise allowing each party to escape with some dignity intact and without bloodshed.</p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> is credited with working to avoid violence, then <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also deserve a share of the glory. They took seriously their instructions from <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> to deal with Indians "in a most friendly and conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit." <a href="#n0234" id="ln0234" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a> The captains also understood the flexibility they had as explorers. They could, with enough determination and good fortune, move up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Unlike the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> traders, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not have to stay with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , trade with them, and depend on their cooperation. Subsequent <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> parties, from <span class="tei_name">Nathaniel Pryor's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> expedition to <span class="tei_name">Wilson Price Hunt's</span> Astorians, would find the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   as intransigent as ever.</p>
               <p>
The memory of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   September was still fresh when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, writing from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> during the winter of 1804–1805, described the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> as "the vilest miscreants of the savage race, and must ever remain the pirates of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>." <a href="#n0235" id="ln0235" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> harsh words masked a harsher reality. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   talks had failed. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were no closer to becoming part of the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade network. No delegation of <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> dignitaries was prepared to visit the president. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> call for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to make a "friendly impression" on <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> folk was lost in a welter of conflicting band and personal quarrels. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted as much when he informed <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> that <span class="tei_name">Corporal Richard Warfington's</span> return party bound for <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, the spring of 1805 was sure to encounter heavy 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   fire. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   hostility might endanger not only <span class="tei_name">Warfington's</span> men but the keelboat loaded with the expedition's journals, maps, and botanical specimens. The hazard was real enough that <span class="tei_name">Warfington's</span> men "pledged themselves to us that they will not yeald while there is a man of them living." <a href="#n0236" id="ln0236" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a> This was hardly the sort of diplomatic conclusion <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> sought. At best <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could say their efforts were inconclusive; at worst they may have exacerbated 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -American relations.</p>
               <p>
Nearly 150 years later, Bernard DeVoto voiced what has become historical wisdom about the encounter. DeVoto declared that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> defeated the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>, forced them to back down, and made them "women" in the eyes of their neighbors. Heaping abuse on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , he described <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> soldiers as "bully boys" engaged in "storm trooper tactics." DeVoto maintained that after being defeated by the no-nonsense firmness of the Americans, the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> "were just beggars again." <a href="#n0237" id="ln0237" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a> But it was not the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   who were defeated. Rather, it was American diplomacy that had been handed a stinging rebuff. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recognized in their 1806 letter to the North West Company trader <span class="tei_name">Hugh Heney</span>, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   would always be a barrier to trade on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> "until some effectual measures be taken to render them pacific." <a href="#n0238" id="ln0238" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a> They had surely not been rendered "pacific" by three days of playing cat and mouse with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. In the next two decades, as English traders retreated from the prairies and plains and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   population grew, the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands did indeed turn to American merchants. But until that happened, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> assessment that the United States was "miserably weak" proved a painfully accurate appraisal of northern plains realities. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had done little to transform those political and economic realities.
