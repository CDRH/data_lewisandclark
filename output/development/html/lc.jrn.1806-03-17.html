I think the U' States are indebted to me another Uniform coat, for that of which I have disposed on this occasion was but little woarn.—    we yet want another canoe, and as the <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsops</a> will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we will take one from them in lue of the six Elk which they stole from us in the winter. <a href="#n28031701" id="ln28031701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

The pellucid jellylike substance, called the sea-nettle is found in great abundance along the strad where it has been thrown up by the waves and tide.—</p>
               <p>
There are two speceis of the Fuci or seawreck [seaweed] which we also find thrown up by the waves.    the 1st speceis <a href="#n28031702" id="ln28031702" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> at one extremity consists of a large vesicle or hollow vessell which would contain from one to two gallons, of a conic form, the base of which forms the extreem end and is convex and globelar bearing on it's center some short broad and irregular fibers.    the substance is about the consistence of the rind of a citron mellon and ¾ of an inch thick.    the rihind is smooth.    from the small extremity of the cone a long, hollow, celindrick, and regularly tapering tube extends to 20 or thirty feet and is then terminated with a number of branches which are flat ½ an inch in width rough particular on the edges where they are furnished with a number of little ovate vesicles or bags of the size of a pigeon's egg.    this plant seems to be calculated to float at each extremity while the little end of the tube from whence the branches proceed, lies deepest in the water.—</p>
