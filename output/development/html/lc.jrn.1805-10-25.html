filled with water, on account of which we were detained three hours. The rapids continued 3 or 4 miles, when the river became more placid. At night we came to a place where there is a considerable quantity of timber on the hills; both oak and pine, and encamped at the mouth of a creek on the south side. The natives about here are, or pretend to be, very uneasy, and say the Indians below will kill us. We purchased from them a quantity of dried pounded fish, which they had prepared in that way for sale. They have six scaffolds of a great size for the purpose of drying their fish on.

               <p>
Friday October 25th    This morning clear &amp; pleasant; Our Men that were well (all excepting a Guard left with our Canoes,) set off with the loading to a place, below the worst of the rapids; about one Mile distance, which we carried on our backs, The party that were left with the Canoes, took one of our Canoes down the rapids, and narrows of the River.    The channel of the river lays in a narrow place, not about 25 Yards wide, &amp; with difficulty they got through it.    they then returned, &amp; brought the remainder of the Canoes to us, at the place where we had deposited our loading.    One of the Canoes nearly filled, in passing through the Rapid waves &amp; whirlpools in the Rapids.—    We found an Indian village, laying below these falls, or rapids, 〈from whom〉 our officers purchased from the Indians that resided in this Village 16 bags of pounded Salmon; some bread made out of Roots, Cranberries &amp;ca.    The whole of our party having come to us below the rapids; we loaded our Canoes &amp; About 3 o'Clock P. M. &amp; we set out, and proceeded on down through the rapids, which lasted about 2 Miles further &amp; the water running very Rapid, the whole way.—    We found 2 small Islands of solid rock, which lay in the channel of the River in these Rapids.    One of our Canoes run her bow against the point of one of these Islands, &amp; glanced off without receiving any injury.—    The River between the falls &amp; narrows at that place rises at high water 48 feet perpendicular, which is occasion'd by the water being confined by the different narrow places, &amp; particularly at the lower end of them.—    We came too, at the lower end of these falls, and halted for a short time, at which place a Warr party of Indians, came to us.    These Indians were all on horse back, &amp; had Deer &amp; bear meat with them.    Our officers gave their Chief a medal, &amp; he in return gave them some Bears Oil &amp; a fresh Salmon.—    This Warr party of Indians staid with us but a short time.    The Two Indian Chiefs who descended the River with us, told us by signs, that there was a Nation of Indians, that resided on this River below us, who would certainly kill them; &amp; the whole of our party, and that they must leave us, in order to return to their own Village again.    These Indians left 
us at this place, after taking a friendly leave.    Our Officers gave them some presents &amp; they left us much pleased.—    The Chief or head Man that had been with us of the Warr party; wore a curious kind of Jacket, This Jacket was made out of a kind of Splits, which were worked in such a manner, as to defend him against the Arrows shot by his Enemies.—    We proceeded on, &amp; went about 8 Miles further down the River.    The hills the whole of this distance, were high on both sides of the River, and we saw some pine &amp; Oak timber, The River ran smooth all this way, We encamped near a high point of Rocks, a small distance below the mouth of a creek, which lay on the South side of the River; The Country laying a small distance back, from where we are encamped, is cover'd with Timber.—    And the Land on both sides of the River, is barren land    We saw a Number of fish jumping in the River from where we are encamped which we supposed to be Drum fish.—
