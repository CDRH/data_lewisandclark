In the evening we stopped at some Indian camps and remained all night, having come 30 miles. Here we got more fish and dogs. Most of our people having been accustomed to meat, do not relish the fish, but prefer dog meat; which, when well cooked, tastes very well. <a href="#n23101113" id="ln23101113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Here we met an Indian of another nation, who informed us we could get to the falls in 4 days: which I presume are not very high as the salmon come above them in abundance. <a href="#n23101114" id="ln23101114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The country on both sides is high dry prairie plains without a stick of timber.

Friday October 11th    This morning clear &amp; pleasant weather.    We set out early, and were accompanied with 2 More Indians in a small canoe.    We proceeded on down the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> &amp; we passed over some Rapids but found the current mostly run gentle.    At 8 o'Clock A. M. we came to a fishing Camp, where there was a party of Indians, where we purchased 10 fat dogs, a Quantity of Salmon &amp; some dried haws, for to eat.    We saw among these Indians some pieces of a fishing Seine, which we supposed must have come from some Civilized nation.    We also saw among them a Copper Teakettle.    We continued on our way, &amp; saw a number of fishing Camps, where the Natives come to fish in the Spring of the Year.    We also saw Stones piled up in Rows, so that when the River is high the Salmon lies along side the Rocks, at which place the Natives kill them with a Gig.—    The Land at this place is a poor Barren, &amp; on each side of the River lies high hills, &amp; Clifts of rocks, and not a tree of any kind is to be seen, &amp; a few willows are only to be seen in places along the Shore.    We crossed over some Rapids, where the waves rolled high, and abundance of Water in the River; We came about 30 Miles this day, &amp; encamped at a fishing Camp, laying on the South side of the River, where we found a number of Indians, who are of the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">Flatt head</a> Nation, We purchased from those Indians 4 dogs &amp; some Salmon for provisions.    In the evening an Indian belonging to another Nation of Indians came to the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">Flatt head</a> Indian Camp.
