            <p>Memorializing history in the landscape reflects deep-seated cultural needs. This process not only pays homage to the actions, events, or persons deemed significant at a particular point in time, but it also offers a chance for the creators of the historic marker to write their version of history and to use an interpretive format that highlights their own understanding and values. Cultural geographer <span class="tei_name">Kenneth Foote</span> observes in a study of American memorials, "What is accepted as historical truth is often a narrative shaped and reshaped through time to fit the demands of contemporary society." <a href="#nlc.blake.0101" id="lnlc.blake.0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The significance of selecting particular historical interpretations for commemoration is that the impress of these upon the landscape plays a key role in shaping social memory, as "nations rewrite their history, forgetting much, denying more, and replacing past perspectives with new national images and explanations." <a href="#nlc.blake.0102" id="lnlc.blake.0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Ironically, some of the peoples central to American identity—Native Americans—are often memorialized with markers that "mistreat" them, creating a contested landscape of social memory that stands "in desperate need of revision." <a href="#nlc.blake.0103" id="lnlc.blake.0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In the midst of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> bicentennial commemorations, the significance of American Indians in the social memory of the expedition is strongly debated. Some American Indians express concern over the interpretation of their people and see the bicentennial as an opportunity "to tell their own story of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, an epic about Indians hailing out whites, showing them where to go, what to eat, whom to avoid along the way, and how to get hack home in one piece." <a href="#nlc.blake.0104" id="lnlc.blake.0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">Roberta Conner</span>, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the <span class="tei_name">Umatilla</span> Indian Reservation in Oregon and director of its Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, notes that although the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition is only a "tiny story" within the context of American Indian history, it is one with "tremendous impact" because it "is a story about land, the places we call home." <a href="#nlc.blake.0105" id="lnlc.blake.0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of this article is to examine the portrayal of American Indians at the interpretive sites along the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> National Historic Trail (NHT) in the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> to see to what extent multicultural awareness exists. My central thesis is that many of the representations of Great Plains Native Americans along the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail are stereotyped and give little or no voice to Native peoples. This is problematic not only because of the slanted messages about American Indians and social memory that increased numbers of visitors during the bicentennial are receiving along the trail landscape, but also because these poorly drawn interpretations should not be the model for new interpretive sites developed during the spate of bicentennial commemorations. Similar to the perspective of cultural historian <span class="tei_name">Matthew Dennis</span>, I question the meaning of commonly accepted representations of the past and examine them from multiple viewpoints in the belief that this process is essential for all groups to gain meaningful interpretations of the complete cultural and historical significance of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <a href="#nlc.blake.0106" id="lnlc.blake.0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The underlying cause of the desire for a Native American voice in the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> drama goes beyond historical events and the ethnocentric perspective of the expedition journals, it also springs from the privileged status of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition in American social memory. The expedition helped America invent its identity, even while the story grows and changes through each generation. <a href="#nlc.blake.0107" id="lnlc.blake.0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>Some of the recent interpretations of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> portray them as proto-ecologists and multicultural diplomats, but all stories have two sides and it strips the expedition of meaning to exclude the American Indian perspective. <a href="#nlc.blake.0108" id="lnlc.blake.0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Examining the misguided interpretations has another benefit, too, since "distorted or oversimplified images of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> are not only inescapable . . . they provide a fascinating index of changes in American society and culture over time." <a href="#nlc.blake.0109" id="lnlc.blake.0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>  A more inclusive depiction of Great Plains Native Americans along the NHT (the "Trail Tribes") is a critical element in understanding the rich multicultural heritage of places along the trail and the Native role in helping the expedition travel to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> and back.</p>
            <p>This study examines the cultural aftermath of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition through a previously untapped source—the landscape of the interpretive sites on the trail itself. Established in 1978 under the administration of the National Park Service, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> NHT involves dozens of partnering federal, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, American Indian nations, and private landowners. Even the information centers operated by the federal government along the Great Plains portion of the NHT are under multiple jurisdictions, including the US Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Land Management, US Forest Service, and National Park Service. To think of the expedition route as the "<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail" is somewhat of a misnomer since <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not typically blaze a new trail. For the most part, the expedition traveled routes previously used by traders or Native Americans, yet the signs of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> pointing the way fix this image in the NHT interpretation.</p>

            <h4>Great Plains Perspectives</h4>
            <p>The Great Plains segment of the NHT is the focus of this study for several reasons. Foremost, this is the "home of the peoples who gave to most of the world the current perception of what an American Indian is." <a href="#nlc.blake.0110" id="lnlc.blake.0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span> encountered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also were culturally and linguistically distinct (<span class="tei_name">Siouan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Algonquian</span>, <span class="tei_name">Caddoan</span>) from the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountain Indians</span>, with a unique set of intertribal relations and interracial dealings with white traders. Furthermore, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition expressed a different message to <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span> than to those in the mountains or coastal regions because much of the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> had recently been claimed by the <span class="tei_name">United States</span> in the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this study, the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> extends from <span class="tei_name">Kaw Point</span> (the confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> rivers in <span class="tei_name">Kansas City</span>) to the Gates of the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span> in the <span class="tei_name">Big Belt Mountains of Montana</span>. <a href="#nlc.blake.0111" id="lnlc.blake.0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Even though the mountains are not always in close proximity to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> upstream of Gates of the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, here the character of the expedition became focused ever more strongly on crossing the <span class="tei_name">Great Divide</span>, and for the first time the expedition felt it was <span class="italic">in</span> the mountains as opposed to <span class="italic">viewing</span> mountains. River travelers today also see the <span class="tei_name">Gates</span> as the place at the foot of the mountains where the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> has been left behind. <a href="#nlc.blake.0112" id="lnlc.blake.0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Native American messages along the trail is that, to at least some <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> tribes in 1804, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition was just one more party of outsiders interested in trade, continuing an already well-established trend. <span class="tei_name">Tracy King</span> of the <span class="tei_name">Gros Ventre</span> (A'Aninin) Nation says, "If it wasn't <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, it would have been somebody else." <a href="#nlc.blake.0113" id="lnlc.blake.0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Indeed, the incursions of whites had already wreaked radical change with the introduction of horses, weapons, and smallpox and other diseases, as well as the subsequently altered power relations. Yet American Indians easily could have eliminated the expedition at numerous points, and without the aid and accommodation of <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span> the expedition would have foundered long before reaching the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>. <a href="#nlc.blake.0114" id="lnlc.blake.0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The Native American message also tells of how <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> entered an advanced society, not a wilderness, exemplified by the sophisticated agricultural society of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> nations with large earthlodge towns. <a href="#nlc.blake.0115" id="lnlc.blake.0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> To relate their story during the bicentennial commemoration, the tribes have developed tour packages and resource materials for visitors. In <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, for example, the <span class="tei_name">Chippewa Cree</span> run a store marketing tribal arts and crafts, the <span class="tei_name">Lower Brule Sioux</span> in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> tell their tribe's history through tipi and buffalo hide tanning displays, and the Three Affiliated Tribes of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> offer overnight stays in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> earthlodges. More than a desire to cash in on <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tourists, this is a prime opportunity for the tribes to educate the public about American Indian culture of two hundred years past. <a href="#nlc.blake.0116" id="lnlc.blake.0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Although I have made repeated visits to portions of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail, this study relies extensively on detailed fieldwork completed in June 2003 along the entire <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> segment of the route. In the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> it is impossible to separate the physical character of land and the season of the year from the way in which its sense of place is interpreted. Open vistas begin to dominate the landscape north and west of <span class="tei_name">Kaw Point</span>, where trees seek "the river valleys, as though to escape a limitless expanse of wind-whipped grass," cottonwoods begin to dominate riparian woodlands, and the expedition first encountered American Indians and bison. <a href="#nlc.blake.0117" id="lnlc.blake.0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> In the <span class="tei_name">Dakotas</span> at this time of year the trail strikes through a mostly treeless, rolling green prairie in a big sky country of endless summer thunderheads. In <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> the dappled sunlight on the broad expanses of the shortgrass prairie and river lowlands, and the mountains towering into the cumulus, make for unforgettable images along the trail.</p>
            <p>I visited the interpretive sites accessible by automobile within the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>, and closely examined those that have interpretation of American Indians in the context of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <a href="#nlc.blake.0118" id="lnlc.blake.0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Locations visited by a large number of tourists were deemed most central to this study of how American Indians are represented along the NHT. The absence of any single compendium containing every site on the NHT, coupled with the various routes taken by different members of the expedition, resulted, no doubt, in this study's omission of some sites with on-site interpretation of American Indians. Visiting every single interpretive site, however, would not be a feasible nor necessarily meaningful goal given that at any point in time some interpretive sites along the NHT will be closed due to construction, renovation, or decay. Observations were included from nearly all of the major NHT sites, such as national historic landmarks, national historic sites, and places designated as national signature events in 2004–6 by the National Council of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Bicentennial. An attempt was also made to include observations from interpretive sites representing each of the <span class="tei_name">Trail Tribes</span>.</p>
            <p>Forty-eight locations with on-site interpretation were examined for this study. Detailed notes about the textual and pictorial interpretation of American Indians were taken, along with photographs where permitted. <a href="#nlc.blake.0119" id="lnlc.blake.0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> The sites were then analyzed based on (1) American Indian nations interpreted, (2) date of interpretive site development, (3) funding agency and/or management organization, (4) location, (5) interpretation format (e.g., marker or statue), and most importantly, (6) nature of the American Indian portrayal. The interplay of landscape and memory at these interpretive sites along the trail is important to analyze in this manner since "the very durability of the landscape and the memorials placed in the landscape makes these modifications effective for symbolizing and sustaining collective values over long periods of time." <a href="#nlc.blake.0120" id="lnlc.blake.0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> As much as from wood, plastic, and steel, the interpretive sites are built "from strata of memory." <a href="#nlc.blake.0121" id="lnlc.blake.0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Some markers may last only a couple decades, while statues and monuments made of steel or stone may interpret a version of events to multiple generations.</p>
            <p>The findings are categorized into four major thematic representations of American Indians, each having some connection to specific expedition events and places along the trail:  <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span>, <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span>, <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span>, and <span class="italic">Sacagawea Reinterpreted</span>. These themes are presented in a westward sequence because each one is shaped by prior events, yet a purely linear or chronological structure would not account for repetition of the representations along the trail. <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> relates to the councils held with the eastern and central <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span>. <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> encompasses the expedition confrontations with American Indians, primarily with the Teton <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> (<span class="tei_name">Lakota</span>) in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> (<span class="tei_name">Pikuni</span>) in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span> relates to the winter spent with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> (<span class="tei_name">Neuidia</span>) and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> (<span class="tei_name">Nuxbaaga</span>) Nations and the expedition's study of <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span>. <span class="italic">Sacagawea Reinterpreted</span> includes the multiple archetypes attributed to her, such as guide, interpreter, peace symbol, and Madonna of the trail.</p>
            <p>Interwoven throughout the four themes of American Indian representations is a cameo role that is typically reserved for the Natives. American Indian interpretations consistently receive less space than is devoted to any other major aspect of the expedition, such as the transportation, naturalist observations, and camp life displays in the Chamberlain <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Information Center (opened in 2000 by the <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> Department of Tourism and the State Historical Society). The Western Historic Trails Center in <span class="tei_name">Council Bluffs</span> (built by the National Park Service in 1997 and operated by the State Historical Society of <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span>) pays only token attention to Native Americans, noting a few general ethno-historical events, such as decimation by disease. American Indians break out of the cameo role most significantly at the Blackbird Scenic Overview in northeastern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>; Atka Lakota Museum in <span class="tei_name">Chamberlain, South Dakota</span>; <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>
               <span class="tei_name"> Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Interpretive Center in <span class="tei_name">Washburn</span>; Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site in central <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>; and the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> NHT Interpretive Center in <span class="tei_name">Great Falls, Montana</span>, but even at these locations some interpretation fits within one of the four dominant themes.</p>

        <div class="section  tei_div">
            <h4>Councils of Power</h4>
            <p>The primary objective of the expedition, ascertaining the practicability of a water route across the continent for the purposes of commerce, was bundled with numerous other objectives, including scientific observation and collection of plant, animal, and mineral specimens, observation of weather data, study of Indian cultures, mapping geographic features, promoting American trade, and conducting councils with the Indians. <a href="#nlc.blake.0122" id="lnlc.blake.0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> The <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> representation of American Indians in trail interpretation dominates from <span class="tei_name">Kansas City</span> to <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span> at <span class="tei_name">Gavins Point Dam</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>-<span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> border. <a href="#nlc.blake.0123" id="lnlc.blake.0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout this stretch the explorers were on the lookout for Indians with whom to meet. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> eventually were able to hold council with the <span class="tei_name">Otoe</span> (<span class="tei_name">Jiwere</span>) and <span class="tei_name">Missouria</span> (<span class="tei_name">Nutachi</span>), <span class="tei_name">Yankton Sioux</span> (<span class="tei_name">Nakota</span>), <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span>, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> (<span class="tei_name">Sahnish</span>), and <span class="tei_name">Mandan-Hidatsa</span>, with an intent to promote peaceful trade along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, inform the Indian children of the replacement of their late Spanish father with a new great white father, andawe the Indians with the military might of the expedition. <a href="#nlc.blake.0124" id="lnlc.blake.0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Although several NHT sites mention Indian trade, including at Case Park in Kansas City, Missouri, where a marker recently erected by the Choteau Society notes that the Kansa had traded with the French, and at the 1980s-era Sergeant Floyd Riverboat Museum (operated by the Sioux City, Iowa, Museum and Historical Association) with a mention of the trading presence of Indians on the river, the overall American Indian interpretation in this segment of the trail is heavily slanted toward the first Otoe-Missouria council on August 3, 1804.</p>
            <p>Images of American Indian acquiescence dominate the <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> representation, such as at the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Monument in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Nebraska's Fort Atkinson State Historical Park (established in 1963 on the western bank of the river at the site of the first council), and the interpretive centers in Chamberlain and Great Falls (opened in 1998). Displays frequently refer to the American Indian desire for peace and ex-tending the hand of friendship. Replica and authentic peace medals are ubiquitous, implying tribal acceptance of the United States as the sovereign power. The North Dakota <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Interpretive Center, opened in 1997 by the North Dakota <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Bicentennial Foundation in Washburn, informs of the American Indian desire for peaceful trade, which is also a major theme at the Knife River and Fort Union National Historic Sites, but the Washburn center also interprets that Indians were unwilling to part with their war rituals, and the diplomacy of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "never imagined the Indians as true partners." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s gift-giving is another standard element in <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span>, with displays on this at the interpretive centers in Chamberlain, Calumet Bluff, and Sioux City.</p>
            <p>In the <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> representation, American Indians are rarely portrayed as equals to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Monument in Council Bluffs, erected in 1935 by the Colonial Dames of America and re-dedicated in 1993 to commemorate "the meeting between famed explorers <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and area Native Americans," has two large relief panels depicting American Indians presenting the expedition with melons (a rare instance of interpretation showing gift-giving by the tribes) and shaking hands with the explorers, but there is no further depth to the tribal interpretation. Not only are the indigenous peoples nameless, the <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> representation also renders them land-less in a 1990s-era NHT marker at the monument, with a map showing the expedition route in the western portion of the continent passing through lands either designated Oregon Country, Louisiana Purchase, or New Spain, but not Indian lands. The depiction of American Indian land claims as nonexistent or subservient to other powers is repeated in the interpretative maps at Sioux City's Southern Hills Mall (produced for display in 2003 by Split Rock Studios, a museum outfitting company based in Arden Hills, Minnesota), the interpretive center in Sioux City (opened in 2003 by the Missouri River Historical Development, Inc., a nonprofit organization funded by the local riverboat casino), and the 1960s-era Fort Leavenworth Frontier Army Museum. These representations are ironic given that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s 1814 map acknowledged an Indian presence while ignoring Spanish and British claims. <a href="#nlc.blake.0125" id="lnlc.blake.0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The geographic imprint of the Trail Tribes is consistently absent from many interpretive maps along the NHT, and the <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> representations are consistent across multiple media and decades. The Council Bluffs monument seemed to set the dominant representation nearly seven decades ago with noble yet stylized depictions of the Otoe-Missouria. Left unsaid is the great change over the past two hundred years for these peoples. Dispossessed of their Platte River homeland in southeastern Nebraska, the Otoe-Missouria eventually relocated to Oklahoma. <a href="#nlc.blake.0126" id="lnlc.blake.0126" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Rhonda Dent of the Otoe Nation observes, "We were the first to greet <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and look what happened to us." <a href="#nlc.blake.0127" id="lnlc.blake.0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Bicentennial commemorations and interpretive sites containing a Native American voice would provide these peoples a chance to "reconnect to their homeland." <a href="#nlc.blake.0128" id="lnlc.blake.0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Literally putting the tribes on the maps reinforces the message that the Native peoples, despite overwhelming odds, are still in place to offer their unique perspective. <a href="#nlc.blake.0129" id="lnlc.blake.0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>

            <h4>Hostile Encounters</h4>
            <p>The transition from the <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> to <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> representation begins in <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span> and is complete by central <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> encounter is perhaps the signature event in the interpretation of American Indians in the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> portion of the trail. This episode is recounted at every interpretive site from <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span> to <span class="tei_name">Pierre, South Dakota</span>, and in the Pierre area this story is usually the sole focus of the interpretation, such as at <span class="tei_name">Farm Island Recreation Area</span>, <span class="tei_name">LaFramboise Island Nature Area</span>, and the confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Bad</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> rivers. Interpretive sites in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> and <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> also focus on this encounter, reflecting its drama and the fixation of the expedition on the Teton Sioux dominance of Missouri River trade. <a href="#nlc.blake.0130" id="lnlc.blake.0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> The significance of the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> representation is indicated on the National Park Service standard map panel installed many places along the NHT. It mentions <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span> only three times: first council, <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux </span>encounter, and <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> encounter (the other major event in <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span>).</p>
            <p>The <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> representation is well illustrated by several versions of the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> encounter. At <span class="tei_name">LaFramboise Island Nature Area</span> in <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span>, on the east bank of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, the 1990s-era NHT marker reads:</p>
            <p>The expedition had its first meeting with the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> on September 25, 1804, at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Teton River</span> (today's <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>), just across from here. The captains met on shore with three chiefs: Black Buffalo, Partisan and Buffalo Medicine, then took them out to the keelboat. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned the Chiefs to shore, several <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> attempted to detain him. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> drew his sword, the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> strung their bows, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> readied the men for action. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> moved to diffuse the situation by ordering his men to back off. Eventually, they allowed <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to return to the keelboat; two of the chiefs went with him.</p>
            <p>This text attributes the initiation of hostilities to the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> with an attempted detainment of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, although it notes Black Buffalo was a calming influence. The Washburn interpretive center expounds on the hostile nature of the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> by stating:</p>
            <p>Even gift-giving became a disaster when they gave one chief, named the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>, fewer gifts than his rival, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>. Highly offended, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> hijacked a pirogue.</p>
            <p>The Great Falls interpretive center rationalizes the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> action this way:</p>
            <p>The open trade advocated by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would wipe out the <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span> monopoly. No wonder they treated the Expedition with hostility.</p>
            <p>Although the Great Falls center at least places the encounter in the context of power relationships, the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> interpretations are silent on other possible causes for the tense negotiations, such as preconceived notions on the part of the captains, or how the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> were insulted by the expedition's poor diplomacy in offering mere trinkets as gifts, or how the tribe was offended at the idea of subjugation to yet another new great father. <a href="#nlc.blake.0131" id="lnlc.blake.0131" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a> The aggressive theme is oft repeated at other sites: the 1990s-era Calumet Bluff visitor center calls the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> "one of the most aggressive of the Sioux bands"; the Chamberlain information center contains text on how the captains reacted with firmness to the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> warnings and threats; and the South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center (built in 1989 and operated by the State Historical Society) features text about how the expedition was always on its guard after the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> tried seizing one of the expedition's canoes as toll. The murals and accompanying text at the Southern Hills Mall in <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span> also echo the greedy interpretation of the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> by stating that they "demanded more than the expedition could afford."</p>
            <p>The same event may be interpreted from several different perspectives, however, and while the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> encounter is dominated by interpretation with hostile overtones, a nonattributed west-bank marker of indeterminate age in Lilly Park at the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span> confluence reads, in part:</p>
            <p>President <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span> commissioned Captains William <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and Meriwether <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to explore the Louisiana Purchase and make peaceful contact with the native nations. Here where the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span> meets the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the Corps of Discovery held council, feasting, and celebration with the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span>. Language barriers led to an armed confrontation, diffused largely through the efforts of <span class="tei_name">Chief Black Buffalo</span>. The expedition continued peacefully to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Ocean</span>.</p>
            <p>Without casting blame on either party or portraying the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> as aggressive or greedy, this marker offers a neutral rendition that avoids the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> archetype.</p>
            <p>The <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> encounter in northern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> was the most violent of any of the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span>. All the National Historic Trail interpretations of this event follow approximately the same script, illustrated with this text at the Great Falls center:</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> rode deep into <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> (<span class="tei_name">Pikuni</span>) country. On July 26 near the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span>, eight <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> men rode towards them. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> presented three among them with a flag, a medal, and a handkerchief. That evening he described America's intentions to trade guns with the <span class="tei_name">Salish (Sells)</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shoshone (Aqui-Dika)</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce (Nimiipu)</span>. This news may have alarmed the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> because these tribes were their traditional enemies. At dawn the warriors attempted to steal the party's guns and horses. In the ensuing fight, <span class="tei_name">Reubin Field</span> mortally stabbed an Indian and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> shot another, narrowly escaping being killed himself. The <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> beat a hasty retreat. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> quickly burned the warriors' abandoned shields and reclaimed the flag given the previous day. He left a peace medal around the dead warrior's neck and fled the scene.</p>
            <p>The Montana Historic Expedition Trail Map produced in the past few years by the Bureau of Land Management (exhibited at <span class="tei_name">Pompeys Pillar National Monument and Decision Point</span>) enhances this representation by showing <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> shooting the "thieving" <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> are also represented as hostile in the interpretation at the Washburn center and the Great Falls Ryan Island Day Use Area (developed in 1976 by Montana Power Company). The most biased portrayal of the hostile, powerful <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, however, is in a mural at the Southern Hills Mall in <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span>.</p>
            <p>As is typical with any narrative, verbal or written, multiple versions of the encounter exist in <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> oral tradition. The only in-stance of this viewpoint presented along the NHT is in the Great Falls interpretive center:</p>
            <p>A <span class="tei_name">Pikuni</span> raid near the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span> in 1806 ended in tragedy. <span class="tei_name">Wolf Calf</span>, a member of the <span class="tei_name">Pikuni</span> party, recalled the incident years later. He said a war party was roaming the southern bounds of their territory when they met the first white men to ever visit the area (<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men). The <span class="tei_name">Pikuni</span> greeted the white men in a friendly way, but later the chief directed the young men to steal their guns. In the attempt, a <span class="tei_name">Pikuni</span> named <span class="tei_name">Side Hill Calf</span> was killed with the white men's "big knives."</p>
            <p>Yet another <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> version, although absent from on-site interpretations, is far different:</p>
            <p>Two <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> boys-12 and 13-were on their way home when the men of the expedition spotted them and invited them to camp. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> kept insisting they camp with them. He said we have a gift for you, and they had hands on guns at all times. In the middle of the night the boys tried to leave. One of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s men woke up and stabbed one boy. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> shot the other. <a href="#nlc.blake.0132" id="lnlc.blake.0132" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Significantly, this is the version that is taught in a <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> school, and thus it may be assumed to have more resonance with the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> than <span class="tei_name">Wolf Calf</span>'s account. Horse stealing, a common action among <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span> and a recognized war honor, <a href="#nlc.blake.0133" id="lnlc.blake.0133" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> is also transformed by some NHT interpretations into a degenerate act. The portrayal of the <span class="tei_name">Crow (Apsaalooka)</span> theft of horses on the return trip, seen in the Chamberlain and Washburn centers, also fits within the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> theme.</p>
            <p>The unflattering <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> portrayal of American Indians would be expected from an outdated source rather than in so many displays created in the past two decades. The pictorial reinforcement to the written text of this theme in the <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span> Southern Hills Mall murals and the <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> trail map is particularly disturbing and runs strongly counter to achieving even a modicum of multicultural awareness along the trail. <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> may be so firmly entrenched in popular thought because of its portrayal in <span class="tei_name">Bernard DeVoto</span>'s generally highly regarded and widely read abridgment of <span class="italic">The Journals of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
               </span>. It refers to the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> as "among the most warlike of Indians, swaggerers and bullies," and it notes that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> handled the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> encounter "with an expertness that no one could have surpassed." <a href="#nlc.blake.0134" id="lnlc.blake.0134" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a> The journal entries of the expedition members cement this impression; <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, for example, used words like "vilenous [sic], hostile, and treacherous" to describe the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span>, who "ill treated us." <a href="#nlc.blake.0135" id="lnlc.blake.0135" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Yet cause for hope exists in suggestions for balanced portrayals of American Indians, such as one published by the Montana Governor's <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Bicentennial Commission. It says that to improve <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>'s <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> interpretation, interpretive signs should "emphasize the Native American point of view." <a href="#nlc.blake.0136" id="lnlc.blake.0136" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>

        <div class="section  tei_div">
            <h4>Good Neighbors</h4>
            <p>In the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Washburn, North Dakota</span>, the dominant representations of American Indians change direction in a manner reminiscent of river travelers turning westward at the dramatic <span class="tei_name">Great Bend of the Missouri</span>, as the <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span> theme arises to a primary position among Native American interpretations. The "Good Neighbors" exhibit at the Washburn center discusses at length the mutually beneficial relationship of hospitality, friendship, and military alliance between the expedition and the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>. American Indian assistance to the expedition is rarely interpreted in detail elsewhere, with the exception of the Sioux City interpretive center and <span class="tei_name">Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site</span> (designated in 1974, with most interpretation development in the past fifteen years).</p>
            <p>The NHT interpretations of the expedition's ethnography are also inherent in the representation of Native Americans as <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span>. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> instructed the expedition to study "seventeen areas of Indian life and culture," from "language and law to trade and technology," all with a watchful eye toward business enterprise, national expansion, and the empire of knowledge.  <a href="#nlc.blake.0137" id="lnlc.blake.0137" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a> The <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span> representation is manifest throughout the NHT in the elementary interpretation of American Indians as static, passive culture groups worthy of study, such as with artifacts on display in the <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span> centers and the Sergeant Floyd Riverboat Museum; displays on farming and hunting habits at Calumet Bluff, West Whitlock, and Knife River; signs about Indian words or legends providing place names at the Chamberlain center and Big Sky Wayside Exhibit in Terry, Montana; and interpretation of Indian plant use at Pompeys Pillar. While in aggregate <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> assembled a valuable ethnographic record, in practice along the NHT it is generally presented piecemeal and in a way that conflates Native American cultures, with the notable exception of the Great Falls NHT center.</p>
            <p>The earthlodge exhibit at the Great Falls NHT center notes the role of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as ethnographers but also recognizes that their views were prejudiced, often describing "only external features and events, neglecting the spiritual and cultural significance of what they saw." This statement aptly illustrates the limited perspectives offered by a <span class="italic">Good Neighbor</span>s archetype of <span class="tei_name">Plains Indians</span>. The interpretation of the expedition's ethnography is visually oriented toward Native American dwellings, especially tipis and earthlodges. A tipi dominates the Indian display inside the Chamberlain center, and a stylized tipi outside is the signature architectural feature of the center. Tipi replicas are also on display at the Atka Lakota Museum, Fort Union Trading Post, and Southern Hills Mall. Earthlodges are even more frequent on the trail, with displays about their construction or replicas at <span class="tei_name">Blackbird Scenic Overview</span>, <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span>, <span class="tei_name">West Whitlock</span>, <span class="tei_name">Double Ditch</span>, <span class="tei_name">Great Falls NHT center</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>.</p>
            <p>Although the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> site offers a great deal of ethnographic interpretation, it still lacks a Native American voice that goes beyond the material culture of tools and housing, to religion and governance, for example. This absence is common among a variety of sites, all developed within the past twenty-five years. <span class="tei_name">Amy Mossett</span>, a <span class="tei_name">Mandan-Hidatsa</span>, wants the commemorations to recognize that "Indians have the strongest sense of place of anyone in the world." Of the sophistication of her society she adds, "<span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wanted to make Indians into farmers and traders. But we were already doing all of that. The difference is, we were doing it without slave labor." <a href="#nlc.blake.0138" id="lnlc.blake.0138" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Quotations of American Indian perspectives about their own identity, civilization, or beliefs are used liberally at the Great Falls NHT center to add a Native voice.</p>

            <h4>
               <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> Reinterpreted</h4>
            <p>Changing interpretations of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition reflect changes in society, such as the increasing interest in <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> concurrent with the women's movement. <a href="#nlc.blake.0139" id="lnlc.blake.0139" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a> Included in the expedition for her ability to interpret with <span class="tei_name">Shoshones</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> is the most instantly recognizable individual in displays along the trail since she is the only woman and usually the only depicted Native American. <a href="#nlc.blake.0140" id="lnlc.blake.0140" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Her image has transcended her original role in multiple reinterpretations of what she meant to the expedition. Like the <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span> representation, the <span class="italic">Sacagawea Reinterpreted</span> theme is a widespread element in the NHT interpretation, but it is strongest from northern <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> to <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>.</p>
            <p>The easternmost and westernmost Great Plains sites on the NHT with on-site interpretation both feature statues: Kansas City's Case Park (erected circa 2000) and the Broadwater Portage Overlook in Great Falls (erected 1989). Sacagawea is a sculpture staple along the trail, featured in Kansas City, Missouri; Bismarck, North Dakota; and Miles City, Fort Benton, and inside the Great Falls NHT interpretive center in Montana. <a href="#nlc.blake.0141" id="lnlc.blake.0141" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Sacagawea faces west on all five statues, which points to the emphasis of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> trail interpretation on the westward adventure rather than the return and to Sacagawea's multiple roles in that westward progress. Her absence from statues in Sioux City, Washburn, and at the Broadwater Portage Overlook symbolically suggests the ambivalence of the American Indian portrayal along the NHT in the Great Plains. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s dog, Seaman, on the other hand, appears on both the Sioux City and Broadwater Portage statues as well as in <span class="tei_name">Kansas City</span>.</p>
            <p>So many meanings have been layered upon <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> that her true self could well be unrecognizable in her mythic interpretation. Even her name changes as one moves among the interpretation sites. <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span> is often the preferred spelling in <span class="tei_name">Wyoming</span> and <span class="tei_name">Idaho</span>, a reflection of the phonetic <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span> pronunciation for a name meaning Boat Launcher. <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span> is used in northern <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> and in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> because of the phonetic <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> pronunciation for a name meaning <span class="tei_name">Bird Woman</span>. Because <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>'s name is usually spelled in this fashion along the trail and in the literature, I use this spelling except for when it is spelled differently at a particular interpretive site. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> is portrayed as the expedition's "indomitable and unerring" guide in the earliest interpretations of her extant along the NHT, dating back to 1910 at the Bismarck statue (erected by the Federated Clubwomen and schoolchildren of <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>) and 1920 at the <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span> Monument in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> (erected by the Mobridge Hickory Stick Club). The unerring guide representation is repeated many times along the trail in later interpretive efforts, including on the 1928 Daughters of the American Revolution plaque at <span class="tei_name">Pompeys Pillar</span>, the 1972 marker at the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> reconstruction, and on the recent <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> trail map at Decision Point and Pompeys Pillar that indicates, "<span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> points the way." At the <span class="tei_name">Washburn</span> and <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> centers her role as a guide is reinterpreted to say, "She did not guide the Expedition as romanticized accounts claim, but she did provide crucial help in several instances."</p>
            <p>According to several reinterpretations of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> in the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>, this "crucial help" was either as an interpreter for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> or a harbinger of the peaceful intent of the expedition. Both of these perspectives are quoted from the journals of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> at the <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span> statue interpretive marker in <span class="tei_name">Bismarck</span>, and they are repeated in the <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span> and <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> interpretive centers. <a href="#nlc.blake.0142" id="lnlc.blake.0142" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> interpreter role is also elaborated in a NHT marker at the Jedediah Smith Monument near <span class="tei_name">Mobridge, South Dakota</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span> as a symbol convincing local tribes that the expedition came in peace is reiterated in the Washburn center. Building upon the <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> archetypes of guide, interpreter, and token of peace, she is also portrayed as a heroic Madonna of the trail, uncomplainingly dealing with the hardships of travel while caring for an infant; <a href="#nlc.blake.0143" id="lnlc.blake.0143" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a> every statue and depiction of her along the trail includes her son, <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</span>. Statues and earlier memorials favor the interpretation of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> as a guide or Madonna, whereas her reinterpretations as interpreter or harbinger of peace come in later displays along the trail.</p>

            <h4>Native American Voices</h4>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Mark Spence</span> highlights the challenges of interpreting American Indians within the context of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, noting that current commemoration efforts are rooted in old ideas that cloud understanding of the expedition and perpetuate a set of cultural burdens that are increasingly problematic. The interpretation of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "as exemplary models of multiculturalism" is even "less accurate" than that of a century ago when they were hailed "as champions of industrial growth and resource exploitation." <a href="#nlc.blake.0144" id="lnlc.blake.0144" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a> According to <span class="tei_name">Spence</span>, the danger is that the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> bicentennial will portray excitement and adventure but not all of the expedition's legacies. He calls for "an honest assessment of the expedition as a long, difficult, imperial venture with tragic consequences for the peoples and homelands that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described and evaluated." <a href="#nlc.blake.0145" id="lnlc.blake.0145" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a> The dependence of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on resident communities in making their way across the continent is still under-emphasized along the trail. How can we recover what has been lost since the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition if we do not receive a comprehensive view of who they encountered?</p>
            <p>Although the <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span>, <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span>, <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span>, and <span class="italic">Sacagawea Reinterpreted</span> representations dominate the Native American interpretation along the Great Plains portion of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail, eleven of the forty-eight places with on-site interpretation lack even a brief mention of American Indians. In almost every case of omission, the tribes could have been interpreted as part of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> journey, since American Indians were rarely completely separate from the expedition. The construction and renovation of interpretive sites for the bicentennial commemoration offered a chance to end the silence of Native American voices and the recycling of old themes. <a href="#nlc.blake.0146" id="lnlc.blake.0146" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The persistence of poorly drawn Native American representations along the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail likely emanates from a variety of circumstances, including the influence of <span class="tei_name">DeVoto</span>'s seminal work mentioned earlier in <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span>, and the power of the heroic <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> myth. A lag time in either the ability or inclination to replace semipermanent markers contributes to the presence of outdated perspectives, as could the lack of a single management directive to include the Native voice. The variability in American Indian cultures and in the versions of Native oral histories also is a contributing factor. Yet it is also clear from some recent biased interpretations that some organizations are at best uninformed by recent scholarship, or at worst unwittingly racist. <a href="#nlc.blake.0147" id="lnlc.blake.0147" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Rarely do the NHT interpretations attempt comprehensive summaries of the legacy of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> (especially pertaining to Native Americans), but a comparison of two examples illustrates the potential voice versus silence of indigenous peoples in the expedition drama. At the South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center a recent interpretive display called the "Explorers' Legacy" reads, "The <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition made the West real for Americans. . . . The Corps of Discovery brought back a wealth of information about land, plants, animals, and native tribes." This passage perpetuates the cameo role for American Indians and implies they had no sense of place prior to the expedition. Conversely, the Atka Lakota Museum (opened in 1991 by St. Joseph's Indian School) strips the journey of its heroic drama and instead focuses on the changes to the people and place:</p>
            <p>The <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span> met <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> in 1804. Subsequently, increasing contact with the white world included traders, explorers, missionaries, the US Army, Indian Agents, miners, and settlers, bringing sweeping changes to the Great Plains. Thousands of Indians died from diseases, setting off a struggle for the people to retain what was theirs amid the seemingly endless tide of the wasicu (white men). Eighty years after the encounter with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> the buffalo were gone, forever changing the <span class="tei_name">Lakota</span> way of life.</p>
            <p>Because no one organization has had total control over the NHT interpretation, there are multiple layers of meaning regarding American Indians. Given the varied and constantly changing perspectives on American Indian interpretation, however, the existing decentralized NHT interpretation model may be best.</p>
            <p>Historian <span class="tei_name">Simon Schama</span> notes that "not all cultures" embrace the myths produced by the interplay of landscape and memory "with equal ardor." <a href="#nlc.blake.0148" id="lnlc.blake.0148" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a> Skewed interpretations apparently resulted in the defacement of several <span class="tei_name">Jedediah Smith</span> plaques and the Sakakawea Monument plaque near <span class="tei_name">Mobridge, South Dakota</span>, on the <span class="tei_name">Standing Rock Reservation</span>. The damage is at two different locations separated by several miles of paved and dirt roads, and it is selective at each site, targeting specific language as opposed to random or senseless destruction. Even the choice of the medium for the vandalism seems purposeful and symbolic, as it consists of red paint sprayed over some text in a neat circle. It is not hard to imagine why someone in this area would disagree with the heroic portrayal of <span class="tei_name">Jedediah Smith</span>, but less immediately evident is why some text at the Sakakawea Monument received the same treatment. An explanation may lie within the Native American perspective that urges teachers to "avoid materials which illustrate Native American heroes as only those who helped Euro-Americans." <a href="#nlc.blake.0149" id="lnlc.blake.0149" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a> The Sakakawea Monument interpretive text places her significance entirely within the context of a noble savage helping the expedition: "Sakakawea won her place in history as the indomitable guide of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on their trip to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> in 1805. . . . By her courage, endurance, and unerring instinct she guided the expedition over seemingly insuperable obstacles. . . . <span class="tei_name">Sakakawea</span> is, beyond question, the most illustrious feminine representative of the Indian race." On the site of the Sakakawea Monument, a bronze relief picturing her and <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</span> is undamaged, as is the nearby <span class="tei_name">Sitting Bull</span> Monument. Likewise, at the <span class="tei_name">Jedediah Smith</span> Monument site the text is untouched that interprets Sacagawea as the trip's only female and a key interpreter with the <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span>.</p>
            <p>Enhancing the contemplative mindset of visitors along the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail could at times be equally important as creating the right tone in American Indian interpretation, however. <a href="#nlc.blake.0150" id="lnlc.blake.0150" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">Spirit Mound, South Dakota</span>, offered a powerful opportunity for personal contemplation about the meaning of the place to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and Native Americans during my fieldwork, but that was by accident, since the site recently was acquired by the state, with the old interpretation mostly removed and the new interpretation not yet installed. Furthermore, road construction forced me to approach the summit from an unconventional direction, making my own path across the prairie; therefore, I drew a sense of place through my own touch, smell, sight, hearing, <span class="italic">and spirit</span>. Had I visited <span class="tei_name">Spirit Mound</span> even a few weeks later the interpretive signs would likely have been in place and the visit highly structured, all to the possible detriment of a contemplative experience.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, interpretive sites along the NHT can offer an insightful portrayal of Native Americans. <span class="tei_name">Blackbird Scenic Overview</span>, a relatively unknown <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> site in northeastern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, developed over perhaps the last fifteen years jointly by the Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District and the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> Tribe, illustrates an exception to the overall pattern and provides a possible model for future interpretations. The significance of this site accrues from its sacredness to the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> due to the proximity of <span class="tei_name">Chief Blackbird</span>'s grave, not just because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> visited the grave. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> are portrayed as a small part of the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> story in the detailed signs about <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> history, earthlodges, social structure, symbols, and contributions to American society and the expedition. Another sign asks visitors to "respect this sacred area." The inclusion of American Indian partners is a key in breaking the mold of the typical Native representations. Including the perspectives of the Trail Tribes would likely lead to interpretation of contemporary issues related to the legacies of the expedition, such as "sacred site protection and the return of human remains and burial goods." <a href="#nlc.blake.0151" id="lnlc.blake.0151" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Too often in America an "anti-historical habit of thought" intrudes on the representations of the valued past, with history "merely museumized, not integrated with the present." <a href="#nlc.blake.0152" id="lnlc.blake.0152" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Places like <span class="tei_name">Blackbird Scenic Overview</span> and the Great Falls NHT center offer a sharp and refreshing contrast to this tendency.</p>
            <p>Analyzing the date, creator, and format of interpretation leads to several conclusions. Surprisingly, the newest interpretive efforts and those by federal agencies do not always offer the most culturally aware interpretations of Native Americans in the context of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, as evidenced by the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> tone of the 2003 mural display at <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span>'s Southern Hills Mall or the <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span> and <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span> tropes perpetuated at <span class="tei_name">Decision Point</span> and <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>. The media used in American Indian interpretation tend to characterize certain themes. Reconstructions, for example, typically focus on material culture, reminiscent of <span class="italic">Good Neighbors</span>. Signposts and statues are mixed in their messages of <span class="italic">Councils of Power</span> and <span class="italic">Sacagawea Reinterpreted</span>, which largely seems a function of whether American Indians were consulted in the interpretation process. Pictorial representations of the Trail Tribes are the most problematic in the portrayals of <span class="italic">Hostile Encounters</span>.</p>
            <p>It could be unrealistic to expect to see the American Indian voice in the textual interpretation of the trail, since this voice is traditionally oral, not written, and the storyteller tone of voice and listener reaction are elemental to sharing ideas and interpreting meaning. <a href="#nlc.blake.0153" id="lnlc.blake.0153" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a> But to craft new or revise old representations of Native Americans along the trail, recordings of tribal voices, or at least written quotations, and an end to the recycling of insensitive representations would be an appropriate start. Just as some members of the expedition undoubtedly became more attuned to American Indian cultures during their journey, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> trail interpretation should further evolve toward including the Native American voice.</p>
