            </h3>

               <p>
June 15. After impatiently sitting out a morning of heavy rain, the explorers started up the steep, slippery <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> without guides, counting on the long days of approaching summer to let them make up for the late beginning. They were right. In spite of laborious progress through thick forests littered with fallen timber, they covered twenty-two miles.</p>
               <p>
The next morning they were on the way by six o'clock, rejoicing briefly in grassy glades spangled with violets, columbine, and bluebells. This illusion of springtime did not last. Soon the horses were lunging "though intolerable bad fallen timber over a high Mountain on which great quantity of Snow is yet lying." In places that snow was eight to ten feet deep, or so the captains estimated from the depth of the cavities surrounding the tree trunks—cavities created by sun warmth reflected off the wood. When they reached <span class="tei_name">Hungry Creek</span>, on whose banks <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> advance party had killed a deer the previous September, they were confronted with a raging torrent of snowmelt. Rather than enter the flood to skirt the base of projecting cliffs, they forced their horses up and over the obstructions. Rough going. A full day's exertion advanced them only fifteen miles. <a href="#n1801" id="ln1801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In one sense the deepening snow was an advantage, for it had settled enough to hold a horse's weight while covering the dense windfalls and jagged rocks that had plagued the animals at lower elevations. But the snow also covered the trail. Missing the way by taking a wrong turn along one of the many densely timbered, snow-shrouded ridges ahead of them could he disastrous. They needed guides who knew landmarks and, if necessary, could find the way from tree to tree by following scratches on the bark caused by the frequent passage of loaded packhorses. Perhaps such guides, chosen as promised by the Indian council, were already hurrying after them. But perhaps not. To cover the contingency, the officers decided to send <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> back to <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> village with incentives: a good, short-barreled Harpers Ferry rifle for anyone who would conduct them across the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> to <span class="tei_name">Traveler's Rest</span>. If two or three Indians would continue as far as the <span class="tei_name">Falls of the Missouri</span>, acting as both guides and peace delegates to the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, they would receive ten horses plus still more guns. The party would wait for the guides (if any) at some meadow below the snow line where they could find food for themselves and the horses.</p>
               <p>
Reluctant to risk losing valuable instruments and papers while scrambling back down the killer terrain they had just crossed, the officers directed the crew to build a scaffold by tying poles between trees and flooring it with a deerskin. On that platform they placed their valuables and as much dried meat, roots, and baggage as they could get along without during the next few days. Then back they turned—the first retreat the captains had called since the trip began. "The party were a great deel dejected," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted, "tho' not as much so as I had apprehended they would have been."</p>
               <p>
After a two-mile descent made late in the evening, they stopped at a small opening where grass was beginning to show. It did not satisfy the hungry horses. During the night they strayed so far and wide over the steep, thickly forested hills, searching vainly for food, that the party had to spend most of the next morning rounding them up. As soon as <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> were mounted, they hurried ahead. The others followed into a dreadful day. While 
<span class="tei_name">Potts</span> was clearing trail with a "big knife"—we would probably call it a machete—he cut a deep gash across the inner part of one leg. Blood gushed, and this time it was <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> whose medical competence was tested. Fortunately he was well enough grounded in anatomy to know a vein leading toward the heart, and not an artery, had been severed. By whittling a wooden "cushion," greasing it with fat, and pressing it below the wound with a tight bandage, he stanched the flow. He then sewed flesh and skin together, probably with an ordinary needle and thread, and got <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> back onto his horse. <a href="#n1802" id="ln1802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
A little farther on, as the company was fording <span class="tei_name">Hungry Creek</span> single file, <span class="tei_name">Colter's</span> horse fell. The flood rolled rider and mount downstream, over and over among the rocks. Both eventually crawled out, bruised but not seriously hurt. The likelihood of such an accident explains why the captains had preferred leaving their papers unwatched in the forest.</p>
               <p>
To avoid fighting downtimber all the way to <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span> and back again with the guides, if any, they camped on the same meadow, under the same cloud of mosquitos, they had chosen on the night of the 15th. Unfortunately the hunters could find no game there, and so, two days later, they rode another twenty-two miles to their original starting place. Along the way they encountered two young <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> warriors, each leading two extra horses. The pair had not been appointed as guides by the council but were on their way to gossip with the <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span> on <span class="tei_name">Clark's River</span> concerning events of the past winter and learn the allied tribe's plans for the summer. Clearly they would be handy to have along if no appointed guides showed up, and so <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> persuaded them, perhaps with small gifts as well as sign talk (clumsy signs with <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> gone), to delay their journey two days.</p>
               <p>
Although frequent Indian hunting at <span class="tei_name">Weippe</span> had made the deer very shy, the riflemen found a way to lure the does. The females were, at the time, giving birth to their young. By bleating in imitation of a fawn, the men drew targets within easy range. During June 22 and 23 they killed twelve. To this they added four bears, so that the larders were well stocked when <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> appeared on the afternoon of the 23d with three men who had agreed to go as far as the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> in return for two guns. The captains knew them—a brother of <span class="tei_name">Cut Nose</span> and two braves "of good character and respected by their nation." <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> by fall! Eagerly each man caught up the horses assigned to him (somebody must have helped <span class="tei_name">Potts</span>, whose inflamed, infected leg was being treated with poultices of pounded cous roots) and picketed them nearby for an early start in the morning. <a href="#n1803" id="ln1803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The first night out the Indians went through a ceremony they said would guarantee good weather for the trip. At dark they set fire to the dead, dry boughs that hung thickly below the green branches of several tightly grouped firs. The needles caught the flames and whooshed them up the trees, sparks exploding against the night sky—"a beatifull object in this situation," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote. <a href="#n1804" id="ln1804" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The charm worked; the weather held. At the scaffold cache, where they reloaded their goods, the snowpack had shrunk until it was "only" about seven feet deep. In spite of that still-considerable blanket, the Indians were able to go unerringly, each evening, to untimbered, south-facing slopes where patches of bare ground shimmered with tender new grass for the horses. Then back to the winding ridges for another day of progress along sun-crusted snow hard enough to support the animals. From a high knob on the main hogback dividing the drainage of the <span class="tei_name">North Fork of the Clearwater</span> from the <span class="tei_name">Lochsa</span> the whites looked out in awe across stupendous canyons and "mountains principally covered with snow from which to one unacquainted with them it would seem impossible ever to escape. . . . these fellows are most admirable pilots." <a href="#n1805" id="ln1805" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By keeping to the main ridge the pilots avoided the detour along the <span class="tei_name">Lochsa</span> and up <span class="tei_name">Wendover Ridge</span> that <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>, had mistakenly followed the previous September. Now, in June, they needed to save every possible mile and hour. Running out of meat, they ate roots cooked in bear oil. The hungry, weary horses fared little better. But good guidance made the difference. On June 29 they dropped off the ridge, bade "adieu to the snow," and early in the afternoon reached a cluster of hot springs at the foot of low, massive gray cliffs. They had been too hurried on their outward journey to pause there, but this time they made the most of the phenomenon. Over the course of the years Indians traveling back and forth along the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> had dammed the outlet of one of the cooler springs to form a bathing pool. (Some of the springs were too hot to endure. Ah, but this one!)</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, always meticulous, timed his own immersion: nineteen minutes, a dunking that left him sweating profusely. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> stayed ten minutes. The others fooled around at will, the soldiers luxuriating in what was probably their first bath in many months. They did not follow the example of the Indians, who "after remaining in the hot bath as long as they could bear it ran and plunged themselves into the creek [<span class="tei_name">Lolo Creek</span>] the water of which is as cold as ice can make it; after remaining here a few minutes they return again to the warm bath, repeating the transition several times but always ending with the warm bath." <a href="#n1806" id="ln1806" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> A good evening. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span> killed a deer to go with their roots, <span class="tei_name">Potts's</span> leg was healing at last, the violent headache that had afflicted <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> along most of the ridge had abated, and the horses were in surprisingly good shape. Best of all, perhaps, was the knowledge that in six days, and in spite of the snow, they had covered a trail whose previous crossing had taken eleven days.</p>
               <p>
On June 30 they pushed hard to reach <span class="tei_name">Traveler's Rest</span>, close to what they called <span class="tei_name">Clark's Fork River</span> (today's <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot</span>). There they gave themselves and the horses a two-day rest. Renewal: the spring vegetation was aglow with its own exuberance. Fat deer abounded. "this," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> exulted, "is like once more returning to the land of the liveing a plenty of meat and that very good." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> botanized almost frenziedly. He rattled off the names of birds he saw—doves, larks, robins, blackbirds, cranes, jays, crows, and various members of the sparrow, woodpecker, and swallow families. He collected and pressed samples of flowers and shrubs to take East and show <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>—wild roses, serviceberries, chokecherries, lady's-slippers, flags, two kinds of wild clover, and, most especially, the dazzlingly beautiful, pink-hued bitterroot, another useful Indian plant food that few whites learned to like. Later the bitterroot would be named <em class="hi">Lewisia rediviva</em> and be designated as <span class="tei_name">Montana's</span> state flower.</p>
               <p>
During the layover <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> repaired all the guns. The five <span class="tei_name">Nez Percés</span> and the American soldiers ran footraces and horse races. "Those are a race of hardy strong athletic active men," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote admiringly of the Indians. In between contests the horses stuffed themselves as they had not been able to do for a long, long time. Yet even paradise had its drawbacks—mosquitos such as the explorers had not seen since toiling along the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> the year before; the captains could not sit still and write except under netting, and the desperate horses crowded into the smoke of the fires. <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> and <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>, whom <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> thought he had cured, were very sick again with syphilis picked up from the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> women of the coast. <a href="#n1807" id="ln1807" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
During this rest stop, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> refined the plans they had made at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> for their return journey. The party was to divide, at <span class="tei_name">Traveler's Rest</span>, into two groups. One would explore north to, and along, <span class="tei_name">the Maria's River</span>, the other south to, and along, the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>. As each unit proceeded, it would be further divided into subgroups, each assigned a specific task.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> undertook the northern and more dangerous ride. How it came about that he was the one chosen we do not know. First of all, he would strike as directly east as possible to the vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri</span>. He knew, from the Indians and from celestial observations he and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had taken along the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span> route, that this new trail would be from five hundred to six hundred miles shorter than the other. But what, exactly, were its characteristics? Would it serve for transportation and communication between the United States and the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>?</p>
               <p>
Having reached the <span class="tei_name">White Bear Islands</span> above <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, his party would open the caches there and repack the material for transport down the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. That done, the captain and six men would cut across country to <span class="tei_name">Maria's River</span> and determine, if they could, how far north it actually extended—the old dream: a siphon for furs from the <span class="tei_name">Saskatchewan</span>. During this period three men would watch over the goods at <span class="tei_name">White Bear Island</span> until they were 
joined by one of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> subgroups, coming down the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> with the dugouts and other material retrieved from the cache at the eastern foot of <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span>. The combined groups, helped by horses, would transport the baggage around the falls to <span class="tei_name">Portage Creek</span>. After refitting the pirogue hidden there, they would rejoin <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> somewhere near the mouth of <span class="tei_name">Maria's River</span>. During this time, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would take the rest of his group from the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks of the Missouri</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>, whose course he would explore by horseback and boat to its mouth. There he would join the other parties! <a href="#n1808" id="ln1808" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> route would take him almost immediately into the canyon later called <span class="tei_name">Hellgate</span> because of its use as an ambush by the three confederated tribes of <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> (<span class="tei_name">Siksikas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Bloods</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>) and their allies, the <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span>, whom the captains generally called the <span class="tei_name">Minitaris or Gros Ventres of the Plains</span>, although the <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> had no blood or linguistic connection with the <span class="tei_name">Minitaris (Hidatsas)</span> of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, neighbors of the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. After running the <span class="tei_name">Hellgate</span> gauntlet, <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party would continue to <span class="tei_name">White Bear Islands</span>, drop off the three men delegated to stop there, and then turn north into the heart of Pahkee country, a blanket name for all the marauding groups. A risk, yes. But exposure to the <span class="tei_name">Pahkees</span> was what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wanted (or had thought he wanted, back at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>) for the sake of intertribal peace and American commerce. The five <span class="tei_name">Nez Percés</span> who had brought the expedition across the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> would, he hoped, help him reach his goal by continuing with his party at least as far as the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>.</p>
               <p>
Unfortunately the five were already spooking themselves about the dangers involved. They nervously identified certain tracks they discovered near <span class="tei_name">Traveler's Rest</span> as left by the <span class="tei_name">Pahkees</span>. Suddenly they decided they wanted to go home, and it was only with difficulty that the captains persuaded them to continue far enough to put <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> on the right "road to the buffalo."</p>
               <p>
Because the mission was dangerous, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> asked for volunteers. Several men stepped forward. First he chose, inevitably, <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>. To them he added, as sergeant for the group, <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span>, and then <span class="tei_name">Robert Frazer</span> and <span class="tei_name">William Werner</span>. The three men delegated to handle matters at the <span class="tei_name">White Bear Islands</span> were named arbitrarily: <span class="tei_name">John Thompson</span> and the syphilitic sufferers, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span> and <span class="tei_name">Silas Goodrich</span>. Theirs was the easiest of the tasks; during intervals of rest, the ailing pair could "use the mercury freely," to quote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. <a href="#n1809" id="ln1809" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> men divided from <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> early in the morning of July 3, 1806. "I could not help feeling much concern," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted, not so much for himself or <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, one feels, as for the success of the entire expedition. For at that moment, with the homestretch lying ahead, the Corps was disintegrating on purpose.</p>
               <p>
Bear with us now, for we run into a confusion of names. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> group—ten whites, counting himself, and five Indians—started north, down the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot</span>. (The whites called it <span class="tei_name">Clark's Fork</span>.) After riding about five miles they came abreast of the point where today's <span class="tei_name">Clark Fork</span> (their <span class="tei_name">East Fork of Clark's River</span>) joined the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wanted to cross the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot</span> so he could follow the north bank of the <span class="tei_name">Clark Fork</span> through <span class="tei_name">Hellgate Canyon</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Big Blackfoot River</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> called that stream "<span class="tei_name">The River of the Road to the Buffalo</span>," or, in <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Cokahlarishkit</span>. <a href="#n18unnumbered" id="ln18unnumbered" class="ref_link"><sup>[*]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The whites built three rafts for this crossing—three because the only dry driftwood they could find was small and crooked. Disdaining flotation, the Indians rode across the stream, towing their gear in sacks of deerskin manufactured on the spot. Shouting and throwing sticks, the whites chased their seventeen horses into the water. Once started, the animals swam on across the stream after the Indians. Altogether, the crossing took three hours, for the small rafts had to shuttle back and forth several times. During the process the boats drifted downstream more than a mile. By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the remaining men started over, they had reached a place of fast current. They paddled frantically, only to run into some overhanging brush on the far side that knocked <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> overboard. He floundered ashore unharmed. His erstwhile companions, unnamed but identified as poor swimmers, flailed mightily 
with their homemade paddles before managing to land.</p>
               <p>
That was the last notable adventure on the way to the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, unless struggles with fading morale can be called adventures. The next morning (July 4: no celebration that year) the Indians halted. No <span class="tei_name">Hellgate</span> for them. After giving <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> directions to a pass across the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span>, they smoked a pipe together, and the Indians grieved, "confident the <span class="tei_name">Pahkees</span> would cut us off." Then they parted, "these affectionate people [showing] every emmotion of unfeigned regret at separating from us." After that it was hard to pass old war camps, as the whites did nearly every day, and not feel uneasiness. July 6: "we expect to meet with the <span class="tei_name">Minnetares</span> and are therefore on our guard both day and night"—an awkward way to feel about people they had once wanted to find and turn into friends. <a href="#n1810" id="ln1810" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
No confrontation occurred. After crossing the divide at gentle <span class="tei_name">Lewis and Clark Pass</span>, which <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never saw and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> did not name, they came down the <span class="tei_name">Medicine (our Sun) River</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. It was July 11. <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>, had said the traverse would take four days. The <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> had suggested five. The whites had spent a little more than eight, partly because they had sat out a rain and had taken time to hunt. Small matter. Last year's journey by way of <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span> had taken almost two months. (But if they hadn't gone that route they might never have found the horses they needed.) Their spirits soared. "the morning was fair and the plains looked beatifull the grass much improved by the late rain. the air was pleasant and a vast assemblage of little birds which croud to the groves on the river sang most enchantingly."</p>
               <p>
The animals felt the joy, too. By <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> estimate, there were no fewer than ten thousand buffalo in a two-mile circle around the <span class="tei_name">White Bear Islands</span>. "it is now the season at which the buffalo begin to coppelate and the bulls keep a tremedious roaring we could hear them for many miles."</p>
               <p>
By evening they had killed, skinned, and butchered eleven of the massive animals, for food and for hides to be used in making boats, tents, many pack ropes, and other gear. As soon as the boats were finished, they crossed the river and set up camp close to where they had stayed while making the portage the year before. While wolves howled and circled around then at a cautious distance, they opened the cache and discovered that high water had entered the 
pit, destroying <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> bearskins, all the plant specimens he had collected between the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages and the falls, and most of the medicines. But much of what was in his trunk and boxes could be spread out and dried. The wooden wheels of the wagon they had built for portaging their dugouts had survived. The pieces of the iron boat frame looked as good as ever—and about as useful. Best of all, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> detailed chart of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> was intact.</p>
               <p>
Another loss occurred that night. Apparently the party was careless about guarding the horses, and Indians—<span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> believed—made off with ten of the seventeen animals. The reduction caused a shift in plans. The captain would take only <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> with him to the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>. They would ride four horses and lead two spares. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Frazer</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Werner</span> would remain at the camp with <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>, and <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>. After the party floating down the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> from the caches on the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead</span> had arrived, the combined groups would 
use the remaining four horses to help with the portage past the <span class="tei_name">Falls</span>.</p>
               <p>
There was almost a loss of personnel as well. On the 15th, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span>, supposedly ailing with the pox, returned from an errand to <span class="tei_name">Portage Creek</span> with a broken rifle. He said that on his way through the brush of Willow Creek he had ridden almost on top of a grizzly. The bear—but let <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> give the summary. He could be graphic when recounting such episodes in his journal.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">McNeal's</span> startled horse "threw him immediately under the bear; this animal raised himself on his hinder feet for battle, and gave him time to recover from his fall which he did in an instant and with his clubbed musquet he struck the bear over the head and cut him with the guard of the gun and broke off the breech, the bear stunned with the stroke fell to the ground and began to scratch his head with his feet; this gave <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> time to climb a willow tree which was near at hand and thus fortunately made his escape." The adventure put <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to ruminating about luck. Members of the expedition had killed several grizzlies in <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> country, but none had been a match for those of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. "these bear are a most tremenduous animal; it seems that the hand of providence has been most wonderfully in our favor with rispect to them, or some of us would long since have fallen a sacrifice to their farosity." <a href="#n1811" id="ln1811" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the 16th, with no remarks about providence, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> started north, planning to intersect the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span> near the point where <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had turned back from his exploration of the river the previous year. On the 18th they reached the stream about six miles above their target point. They had seen Indian sign along the way and were very much on the qui vive as they jogged ahead for five days, sometimes out on the treeless plains. On reaching the junction of <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank</span> creeks (their mingling forms the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>), they turned north along the <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank</span>. The gravelly soil, alternating in places with clay made rough by herds of buffalo, hurt the horses' feet. There was no sign of the migratory buffalo themselves, however. What little meat the quartet obtained had to be stretched out with pounded cous roots they had brought along for emergencies.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had assumed that <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank Creek</span> might bring him as high as the fiftieth parallel of latitude, close to major tributaries of the <span class="tei_name">South Saskatchewan</span>, as shown on British maps. The stream veered west, however, and by July 22 the party was close enough to the spectacular stretch of the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span> later called the <span class="tei_name">Lewis Range</span> that he could see the gap by which the creek left today's <span class="tei_name">Glacier National Park</span> and entered the plains. Clearly it did not head nearly as far north as he had hoped.</p>
               <p>
Still, it was good to learn even unpalatable truths. The day might come, moreover, when boundary negotiators dealing with <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span> about the upper limits of <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> Territory might find it useful to know just how far north he had penetrated into a key area of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River's</span> drainage system. So he had the party camp beside <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank Creek</span>, intending to make his celestial observations the next day.</p>
               <p>
It rained the next day. It either rained or was cloudy until July 26, when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> grudgingly decided they could wait no longer but must return to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and join the other groups of the fragmented expedition. After naming the bivouac where they had stayed <em class="hi">
                     <span class="tei_name">Camp Disappointment</span>
                  </em> (<span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> emphasis), the quartet rode 
south to <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine Creek</span>. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> pressed down the stream to hunt. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> climbed, on their horses, out of the creek's deep trench for a look at the plains, which in that area were rough and broken.</p>
               <p>
Through his spyglass the captain saw, with a jolt, eight Indians and about thirty horses on another hill about a mile away. Run? He resisted the impulse. The eight Indians had already noticed him, and there might be more out of sight in the folds of the hills. Fleeing would simply invite a chase by people whose horses were probably fresher than his party's. And certainly the whites were outnumbered. The best reaction, he decided, was to hold the <span class="tei_name">Pahkee</span> peace meeting he had talked so glibly about in the councils of the <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span>.</p>
               <p>
Stiffly, like strange dogs coming together, the groups approached each other. The Indians, he noted, had only two guns among them but a full complement of bows and arrows. When no one made a threatening move, all relaxed. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> passed out gifts to the three men who he was told by signs were the Indians' leaders. He understood them to say they were <span class="tei_name">Minitaris of the Plains</span>. If his interpretation was correct, they were lying; Canadian traders who heard the story of the encounter from the Indians themselves identified the eight as <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>, a <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> tribe.</p>
               <p>
Telling them he had much to say, he prevailed on them to camp with him in the river bottom. The spot he chose was a tight meadow between almost unscalable bluffs broken here and there by stubby box canyons that he called niches. Close to the only three cottonwood trees in the meadow the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> erected a large, semicircular shelter of dressed buffalo skins (a windbreak? a sort of half tepee?) and invited <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, who had been fetched back to join the assembly, to sleep there with them. The <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> spread out their blankets close to the fire, which was built near the shelter. Each group, seeking perhaps to bluff the other, said it had many friends nearby. Then, over their pipes, they conversed in signs through <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>. In answer to a question about commerce the Indians said they traded wolf and beaver skins for arms, liquor, blankets, and so on at English forts on the <span class="tei_name">Saskatchewan</span>, six days' ride away. At that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> trotted out, with full embroidery, his Pax Americana talk. He had been to the great waters where the sun sets, he said. Along the way he had convinced many nations of the advantages of living at peace with their neighbors. He had spread the word that the Americans would soon build trading houses on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> that all Indians could visit without fear of attack. Would his listeners, or a delegation summoned by them, ride with him to the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span> and meet his men? (By then, he was figuring, the six soldiers he had left at the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> would be on hand with the white pirogue and its swivel gun. Perhaps the nine men <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was dropping off at the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead</span> would have joined them with their five canoes. Everybody armed. Magic things to see. That ought to impress the Indians.) To those who made the trip, he said, he would give ten horses. "To this proposition," he wrote laconically in his diary, "they made no reply."</p>
               <p>
That night he took the first watch. On being relieved by <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>, he crawled into the shelter where <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> were sleeping. Lying down fully clad, as the others were, he fell into a deep slumber.</p>
               <p>
At dawn someone built up the fire outside. The Indians crowded around it while the whites, except for <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span>, who was then on guard, still luxuriated in their blankets. Lulled by the apparent friendliness of the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>, <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> thoughtlessly laid his rifle on the ground beside <span class="tei_name">Reuben's</span>. <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span> was just beginning to stir and stretch.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> noticed not only the unattended guns but the general unreadiness of all the whites. Speaking quickly and openly, for no one knew their language, they planned a concerted attack. One warrior would make off with both of the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers'</span> guns. Two others would seize the rifles in the shelter—those lying beside <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. The other six <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> should lay hold of the whites' six horses. There seems to have been no intent, right then, to kill the Americans. Such a battle might cost a <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> life, a loss that all Indian raiders were reluctant to face. Bringing home white mens' guns and horses without harm to themselves would give them prestige enough. Besides, the Americans, left unarmed and afoot on the plains, would soon die anyway.</p>
               <p>
Someone flashed a signal and the attack began. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> people responded faster than the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> anticipated. <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> yelled at his brother and raced after the man burdened with their two guns. As they grappled, <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span> rushed up and stabbed the thief to the heart. As he withdrew the knife blade, he heard air whistle through the wound from the punctured lung. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> meanwhile wrested his gun from the man who attempted to spirit it away. Their shouts and scuffles aroused <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Drawing his pistol from its holster, he took after the brave who had his gun, yelling, 
"Drop it!" The man could not understand the words, but the meaning was clear and he could see that plans had backfired. Meekly, he complied.</p>
               <p>
During the excitement the American and Indian horses had mixed together and were galloping away in two bunches, the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> assigned to them racing after them afoot. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the <span class="tei_name">two Fields</span> sprinted after the larger herd. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> pursued the two men hazing the smaller bunch. In the confusion some of the horses peeled off to one side or the other. The rest ran into one of the box canyons, or niches, opening into the main trench of the stream.</p>
               <p>
End of race: there was a blank wall ahead. Realizing this, one of the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> jumped behind a jumble of rocks. The other wheeled and took aim at <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, who, after three hundred yards of running, had pulled within thirty steps of the pair. Although he was gasping for breath, he managed to fire first. His hand held steady and the bullet hit the <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> in the stomach. He dropped to his knees, caught himself, and fired back. The bullet passed so close to 
<span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> bare head that he said he felt the breath of it. The wounded man then crawled away to join his companion among the rocks. Unable to reload—his shot pouch was in the shelter—<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> decided he really did not want to follow the horses into the niche, where one hale Indian crouched, bow and arrow ready. <a href="#n1812" id="ln1812" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
One way or another, the Americans retrieved as many horses as they needed—a bargain, since four of them had belonged to the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> and were better than the ones the whites had been using. While the soldiers hurriedly packed and saddled the animals, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> threw most of the abandoned Indian baggage onto the fire. Seeing that the peace medal he had given to the dead man the night before was still around the corpse's neck, he left it there "that they might be informed who we were," for he still believed more Indians were nearby.</p>
               <p>
Fearing that the fleeing Indians would stir their yet nearby tribesmen to furious pursuit, the whites galloped from the scene in a hurry. Stopping only occasionally to eat, nap, and let the horses graze, they covered 120 miles, by <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> estimate (and he was pretty close), in little more than twenty-four hours. They were stiff and sore as they rode through the morning light onto the edge of a steep slope overlooking the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, but they soon forgot the 
aches. By happy coincidence both of the groups that had been descending the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> hove into sight aboard the white pirogue and five dugouts. Behind them came <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> with the four horses they had been using at the portage around <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>. That portage had been hard work in deep mud, under clouds of mosquitos, but it had only taken four days to complete. And along the way both groups had passed through Edens of game, notably "beaver Sign and lodges without number."</p>
               <p>
The rivermen saluted the fleeing quartet with shouts and rifle fire. On reaching the water's edge, the men threw their saddles into the river and turned the horses loose. Hurriedly, for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was still afraid of pursuit, he urged the boatmen on to the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>, to retrieve as swiftly as possible the red pirogue and the goods that had been cached there the year before.</p>
               <p>
Though the caches were, for the most part, in good order, the red pirogue was too decayed to repair. After stripping it of its nails and ironwork, the explorers resumed their downriver dash, the men plying the oars with a will. Not until then, soothed by the rocking of the boat he was on, did <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> relax with the belief that he and his men had passed well beyond the reach of any retaliation the Indians could mount. He never learned, as we have through the hindsight of history, that the eight <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> had been alone and there had been no pursuit. He never learned either, for he died young, of the disastrous results that flowed from his extemporized incursion into <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> diplomacy.</p>
               <p>
The Indians' first reaction to that murderous little fight—<span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> target at the niche had also died—was a desire for revenge, a response normal to most North American tribes. Only blood satisfaction could wipe away the hurt brought on by the spilling of a friend's or relative's blood. That satisfaction, moreover, could be achieved by inflicting harm on any member of the tribe or clan to which the original attacker belonged.</p>
               <p>
The great Canadian geographer, cartographer, and fur trader, <span class="tei_name">David Thompson</span>, saw the workings of the system in person. During the summer of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> battle with the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>, <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> had tried to cross the northern <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span> to reach the tribes of the upper <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, who then controlled trade with the western Indians by means of guns and sheer terror, turned him back. In 1807, however, <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> got through, because, as he wrote, "the murder of two <span class="tei_name">Peagan Indians</span> by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> of the United States, drew the <span class="tei_name">Peagans</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Mississourie River</span> to revenge their deaths and this gave me an opportunity to cross the Mountains." <a href="#n1813" id="ln1813" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But there was more to the antipathy than just revenge. Having obtained guns from Canadian traders some years before, the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> had driven several tribes westward off the plains into wilderness fastness beyond the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>. Except for annual hunts by large parties, they stayed off, as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had learned during talks with the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span>, and, to an extent, the <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>. Yet the captains supposed that a general peace promoted by the United States and sealed with gifts and demonstrations of wondrous technological devices would solve the problem and let Western Indians visit trading houses on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>—all to the benefit of American mercantile interests.</p>
               <p>
Naively, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had outlined the program to the eight <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>. Probably the implication did not register on them at the moment. Probably simple plunder had been their motive when they grabbed at the guns. But when they rejoined their tribe, they told the full story. Alarm as well as anger ran through the listeners. Trading houses—guns—on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>! Any such development would undercut <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> power and threaten their position as middlemen for the whites of the Hudson's Bay and North West fur companies. So they began lurking along the river and its tributaries, and when the first American trapping/trading parties came upstream on <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> trail, they struck. It was the beginning of a series of guerrilla wars that would keep taking American lives until a smallpox epidemic of the late 1830s and the decline of fur trade reduced the tribe to near-impotence. <a href="#n1814" id="ln1814" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> did not see those developments. <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> did live through those years, however, dying in 1838, but whether he grasped the full panorama, even during his time as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, is unlikely. After all, the Corps of Discovery had merely been trying to carry out <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> bidding, and if there had been trouble, the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> were the ones who, in a most treacherous manner, had started it.</p>
               <p>
This discussion is, of course, basically fruitless. If <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> had not clashed with Indians over the control of the newly acquired West, some other "advance agent of civilization" would have. And the Indians would have fought back. That's the way the American frontier was.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
Trigger fingers kept busy during the long run from the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>, where <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> detachment was expected. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> now had twenty men to feed. Their appetites were huge, game abounded, and the hunters slaughtered exuberantly, taking only the choicest cuts of the animals they killed. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also wanted elkskins for use as shelters against the deluges that were soaking them. The hunters (chiefly <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>) obliged with piles of hides. The soldiers draped them around the poles of abandoned tepees they occasionally found in the bottomlands and perhaps over log frames they erected themselves. Once <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had a crude hide awning stretched over the deck of the white pirogue. More shooting attended his request for the skeletons and woolly coats of mountain sheep that he could take East as specimens of Western wildlife. Grizzly bears furnished irresistible proofs of prowess, and by that time the Corps knew how to go about killing them. One monster they bagged measured nine feet from the tip of its nose to the end of its stubby tail. Finally, hides, bear claws, and elk teeth could be used at times as mediums of exchange in the Indian towns farther down the river.</p>
               <p>
So most of the hunting can be classified as necessary. Still, the size of some of the body counts <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> recorded in his journal lead to a suspicion that many animals were shot just because they were there. On July 30, the nimrods brought in nine bighorns, two buffalo, two beaver, and one elk. The next day, fifteen elk, fourteen deer, two bighorns, and one beaver. Between the morning of August 2 and the evening of August 3, the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> slew twenty-nine deer. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> did say on occasion that they rowed past game without pausing to kill it, as though the restraint were noteworthy. "Game," he wrote on August 6, "is so abundant and gentle that we kill it as we please." The American frontier was that way, too—joyfully exploitive in the presence of seemingly boundless resources. <a href="#n1815" id="ln1815" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> The sadness and the feeling of loss came later, when the good things were hard to find.</p>
               <p>
About 4:00 P.M. on August 7, the detachment reached the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>. From the remnants of a note once attached to a piece of elk horn, they learned <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had arrived there on the 3d but had drifted on, looking for buffalo and, if possible, freedom from mosquitos. Unhurried now that he knew where <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> halted his little fleet a short distance below the river junction to repair the dugouts and let the men, who were nearly naked, make clothes out of deerskin. Then on they went until midday, August 11, when they spotted a herd of elk in a willow thicket on an island.</p>
               <p>
Landing, several of the men scattered out for a little shooting. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, dressed like the others in buckskin, went with them. He had killed one elk in the brush and was pursuing another he had wounded when a bullet slammed into his left buttock. The lead ball passed completely through without striking a bone, grazed a deep groove across the right buttock, and lodged in his trousers. He yelled at <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span>, from whom he had recently separated, got no answer, remembered the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, and jumped to the conclusion that Indians were lurking in the willows. He stumbled to the pirogue. Gathering as many men as he could, he prepared to comb the thicket. Then shock and pain and the blood running down his legs made him give up.</p>
               <p>
His men found no Indians. They did find <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span>, who admitted, with great trepidation, that he may have fired the shot. Satisfied that the accident did not deserve punishment even on the grounds of carelessness, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> let the matter drop and with <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Gass's</span> help turned to the torturous process of dressing the multiple wounds. <a href="#n1816" id="ln1816" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Pain and fever kept him awake most of the night. Nevertheless, when the bowman of the pirogue spotted a riverside camp at eight o'clock the next morning, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> insisted on pulling over and interviewing the two trappers who stepped to the shore to wave at them. They were <span class="tei_name">Joseph Dickson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Forest Hancock</span>, residents of <span class="tei_name">Illinois</span>—the first American trappers to penetrate that high up the river and the first white men the Corps had seen since leaving the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> towns. "I pointed out to them," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote later while lying on his stomach, "the places [on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>] where the beaver most abounded." During the talk <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, who had been separated from the main company for several days while hunting, reappeared with tales of having killed thirteen deer and five elk—and with the skins of thirty-one beaver. Excited by what they had seen and heard, <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hancock</span> decided to return to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> towns with the explorers and persuade one of the French-Canadian voyageurs who lived nearby to help them reach the fabulous fur grounds at the head of the river. <a href="#n1817" id="ln1817" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
At one o'clock that same day the fleet overtook <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party. Once more the crews banged away at the sky with their rifles, "being rejoiced to meet all together again," <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> wrote. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was not in sight, however, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was alarmed until he found his friend stretched out stomach down in the white pirogue and heard his wan assurance that he would soon he on his feet once more. To speed the process <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took over the painful task of dressing the wounds. Before long and still lying on his stomach most of the time, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> began trying to turn his abbreviated field notes into finished copy for his journal. The task proved too demanding and he quit—but not before he performed a last botanical duty by describing in detail the stem, leaf shapes, blossoms, and berries of "a singular cherry" <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> discovered and brought to show him. <a href="#n1818" id="ln1818" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
From then on, as far as we know, the chore of keeping the trip diary was entirely <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> once again. He added the new copy without a break to what he had already written about his detachment's adventures and misadventures since parting from <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> group at <span class="tei_name">Traveler's Rest</span>.</p>
