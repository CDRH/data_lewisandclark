                  <span class="italic">Tuesday 8th.</span>    At 9 o'clock in a fine morning we continued our voyage down the river: passed three islands and several rapids; and at noon stopped at some Indian lodges, of which there are a great many along the river. At 2 we proceeded on again. In the evening, in passing through a rapid, I had my canoe stove, and she sunk. Fortunately the water was not more than waist deep, so our lives and baggage were saved, though the latter was wet. We halted and encamped here to repair the canoe, after coming 18 miles. At this place there are some lodges of the natives on both sides of the river; a 
number of whom keep about us, and we get some fish from them. Two chiefs <a href="#n22100804" id="ln22100804" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> of the upper village joined us here, and proposed to go with us, until we should meet with white people; which they say will be at no great distance.

Tuesday October 8th    We had a fair day, We delayed for to load one of our Canoes &amp; burying a Cannister of powder; which we did on the North side of a broken top Tree, About 9 o'Clock A. M. we set out, &amp; proceeded on with our Canoes down the River on our Voyage; we saw a number of the Indians horses feeding on the side of hills, as we passed along, We also passed over several bad rapids, where our Canoes took in Water, occasion'd by the Waves dashing over the sides of them.—</p>
               <p>
The Current of the River has run rapid the most part of the way this day, &amp; in some places we found the River very deep.    We passed by large Clifts of rocks &amp; naked hills lying on both sides of the River.—    About 12 oClock A. M. we arrived at some Indian Camps, which lay on the South side of the River, in which we saw some well looking Indian Men &amp; Squaws; there was only 5 lodges at this place, and they had several small Canoes, which were tied to the Shore.    These Indians employ themselves in catching of Salmon and catch considerable quantity of them    They were part of the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">flatt head</a> Nation.—</p>
               <p>
We stopped with our Canoes some time, &amp; purchased from these Indians some Salmon for which we gave them round Blue &amp; Green beads, &amp; some small pieces of Tin.    some of our party also purchased from those Indians 2 dogs for trifles—    Those Indians had a number of fine horses, which we saw feeding along the Shore.—    The day proved warm.    We proceeded on but a short distance down the River, and came to another Indian camp; This Camp was situated at the lower end of an Island, where lay some rapids.    We halted here for a short time, &amp; purchased some more Salmon and white bread Roots.—</p>
               <p>
These Indians were also belonging to the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">flatt head</a> Nation.—    We proceeded on and went but a short distance, and took in the Indians that set out this morning by land.    we then continued on our Voyage, and as we were descending a rocky rapid at the foot of an Island on which were some Indian camps, One of our Canoes struck a rock, and wheeled round, where she again Struck 〈a〉 another rock and Cracked the bottom of it, &amp; was near splitting in two; &amp; threw the Man who was steering her overboard, but he with great difficulty got to her again—    This Canoe soon filled with water &amp; hung on the rock in a perilous situation.    Some of the Men on board of her, could not swim; &amp; those Men that could, had no chance of saving themselves, the Waves ran so high, and the current was so rapid, that they must have been dashed against Rocks that lay below them a short distance &amp; in all probability must have drownded.—    It was very fortunate for those Men, that an Indian who saw their situation from the Island we passed last, came to their assistance with a small Canoe &amp; One of our Canoes went also, &amp; took out some of the loading &amp; landed it safe on the Shore.—</p>
               <p>
Our officers had one of the other Canoes unloaded and the Men went, and took out the remainder of the loading from on board that Canoes, which had been stove; and got it all on the Shore below the rapid, They experienced much difficulty in unloading the Canoe in the Rapids, the Current being so very Swift &amp; strong.    We found the whole of the loading got out of that Canoe, wet &amp; we lost some small Articles of the loading.—    Our party were all rejoiced at the fortunate escape that the Men made that were in the Canoe, &amp; think that nothing but the Interference of providence was the occasion.    In the Evening a number of the Natives came to Visit us, &amp; behaved with a great deal of friendship to us all, they continued some time with us &amp; took a friendly leave &amp; departed for their Camps.    These Indians also belonged to the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">Flatt-head</a> Nation.—    We came about 18 Miles this day before the accident happen'd to the Canoe,—    &amp; encamped where we unloaded the Canoes with the baggage.—
