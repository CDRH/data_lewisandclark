Tuesday Septemr 25th    We waited at an Anchor this morning, in expectation of the Indian Chiefs and Warriors arrival here.    about 10 o'Clock A M they came to the bank of the River, there was fifty in number; our officers went on shore to them, where they held a Council, and made three of them Chiefs, and gave them Medals, and some presents.    five of those Indians came on board the boat, and staid a considerable time; they were curious in examing our boat, having never seen one of the kind before—    Our Captain returned on board, fearing some treachery from those Savages.—    <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> and some of the Men went on Shore afterwards in one of the Pettyaugers.—    He found that the Indians inclined not to let us pass any further up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a>; on his going to leave the Shore, a number of them held to the Cable of the Pettyauger, saying, they wanted one of the Pettyaugers to stay behind with them, as they were poor.    <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clark</a> insisted on going on board, but they resisted him for a long time—    they told <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a>, that they had Soldiers on shore, as well as he had Soldiers on board his Canoes; <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> then told them that he had Men and Medecine on board the boat, &amp; Pettyaugers, that would kill twenty such nations in a day.—    They then began to be still, and only said, they wished that we would stop at their lodges, untill their Women &amp; chlldren could see us &amp; our boats.—</p>

Four of the Indians came on board of our boat, and we proceeded on one Mile; and Anchor'd the Boat &amp; Pettyaugers out in the River, at the lower point of an Island, which lay in the middle of the River.    Those Indians that came on board the boat staid with us this Night.—

The "soldiers," as the French traders called them, were warriors chosen to enforce order and discipline on certain occasions, such as hunts, when irresponsible individual behavior could not be tolerated. Sometimes the duty was assigned to the members of a particular warrior society. They punished offenders by flogging with horsewhips, killing the guilty party's dogs or horses, or by destroying his inanimate property. Since their appointment was temporary, the fear of retaliation sometimes inhibited them in the performance of their duties. Chiefs often appointed a soldier to protect a trader during his sojourn with the tribe. See below, <a href="lc.jrn.1804-09-26">September 26, 1804</a>.
