This morning was fair    Thermometer at 18° above naught much warmer than it has been for some days; wind S. E.    continue to be visited by the natives. The Sergt. of the guard reported that the Indian women (wives to our interpreters[)] were in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any time of night and admitting their Indian visitors, I therefore directed a lock to be put to the gate and ordered that no Indian but those attatched to the garrison should be permitted to remain all night within the fort or admitted during the period which the gate had been previously ordered to be kept shut which was from sunset untill sunrise.—
