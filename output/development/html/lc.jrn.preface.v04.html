         <div class="preface  tei_div">
            <p>Again it is a pleasure to acknowledge the help of persons who have assisted in the
development of this new edition of the journals. The individuals named in previous volumes have been a continuing source of help. Persons who have helped
with this particular volume include Robert N. Bergantino (geology), Butte, Monana, and Lawrence L. Loendorf (archaeology), Grand Forks, North Dakota.</p>
            <p>Beginning with this volume, the annotation makes extensive use of United
States Geological Survey (USGS) maps. Bergantino graciously supplied the project with a set of USGS maps (1° x 2°, 1:250,000) on which he had plotted <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> route, camps, and points of observation through <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a>. We used
those maps principally for obtaining modern place names and did not cite them
in notes. Since these maps did not always provide sufficient detail, we turned to
other USGS maps (30° x 60°, 1:100,000), and these were cited in the notes; they
are also listed in the "Sources Cited," at the end of this volume. We were also
aided by three special sources. In July 1979, Bob Saindon prepared a special
supplement for the <em class="hi">Glasgow</em> (Montana) <em class="hi">Courier </em>titles "Lewis and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> in Northeast <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a>." This material was especially helpful for the expedition's trip beween the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Musselshell%20%28Mah-tush%2C-ah-zhah%2C%20Shell%29%20River">Musselshell</a> rivers. The Bureau of Land Management
has developed a set of maps for the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Breaks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Breaks%20of%20the">Missouri River Breaks</a> region, from James
Kipp State Park to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Benton (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Benton%20%28Mont.%29">Fort Benton</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a>. Titled "Upper <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> National Wild
and Scenic River," these maps locate <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> camps and other historic
features on a modern projection. In 1984 Bergantino produced a special map of
"The <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a> Portage of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, 1805–1806." In addition to aiding
our annotation, it was also used in preparing this volume's map of the area. None
of the three sources are cited specifically in the notes.
