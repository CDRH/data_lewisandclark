This morning we had the dryed meat secured in skins and the canoes loaded; we took breakfast and departed at 9 A. M.    we continued up the N. side of the river nearly to the place at which we had encamped on the 3rd of Nov. <a href="#n31040601" id="ln31040601" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> when we passed the river to the south side in quest of the hunters we had sent up yesterday and the day before.    from the appearance of a rock near which we had encamped on the 3rd of November last I could judge better of the rise of the water than I could at any point below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was at that time; the river is here about 1½ miles wide; it's general width from the beacon    [<span class="italic">NB: beaten before—but really beacon</span>] rock <a href="#n31040602" id="ln31040602" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho' in many places it is still wider.    it is only in the fall of the year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock.    this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred feet; it has some pine or reather fir timber on it's nothern side, the southern is a precipice of it's whole hight.    it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river.    at the distance of ten miles from our encampment we met with our hunters in the upper end of the bottom to which we had directed them on the South side of the river.    they had killed three Elk this morning and wounded two others so badly that they expected to get them.    we therefore determined to encamp for the evening at this place in order to dry the meat, in surch of which we sent a party immediately and employed others in preparing scaffoalds and collecting firewood &amp;c against their return.    we found some indians with our hunters when we arrived; these people are constantly hanging about us.—    As has been before mentioned <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt C</a> set out with a party of seven men on 2ed inst. in surch of the entrance of the <a class="regularization" title="Willamette (Multnomah) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River">Multnomah river</a>.    he departed at ½ after 11 A.

Two Indians Came last night very late to our Camp and continued all night.    early we had all the meat packed up and our Canoes loaded ready for to Set out and after an early brackfast at which time all things were ready and we Set out and proceeded to the Camp of <a class="regularization" title="Gibson, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gibson%2C%20George">Gibson</a> &amp; party about 9 miles, they had killed 3 Elk at no great distance and Wounded two others so badly that we expect to precure them. Sent a party of Six men with <a class="regularization" title="Shannon, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George">Shannon</a> who had killed the Elk to bring in the Elk, and formed a Camp, near which we had a Scaffold made ready to dry the meat as Soon as it Should arive. <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">Reubin Field</a> killed a bird of the Quail kind or Class <a href="#n31040613" id="ln31040613" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> which was whistleing near our Camp    it is [lar]ger than the quail or partridge as they are Called <a class="regularization" title="Kentucky" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Virginia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Virginia">[Virg]inia</a>.    it's form is presisely that of our partridge tho' its plumage differs in every part.    the upper part of the head, Sides and back of the neck, including the Croop and about ⅓ of the under part of the body is of a bright dove coloured blue, under neath the under beak, as high as the lower edge of the eye, and back as far as the hinder part of the eyes and thence comeing down to a point in the front of the neck about ⅔rd of it's length downwards, is of a fine dark brick red.    between this brick red and the dove colour there runs a narrow Stripe of pure white.    the ears are covered with some coarse dark brown feathers.    just at the base of the under chap there is a narrow transvirce Stripe of white.    from the crown of the head two long round feathers extend backwards nearly in the direction of the beak and are of a black Colour.    the length of these feathers is 2½ inches.    one overlais and Conseals the other which is Somewhat Shorter and Seems to be raped in the plumage of that in front which folding backwards colapses behing and has a round appearance.    the tail is composed of 12 dark brown feathers of nearly equal length.    the large feathers of the wings are of a dark brown &amp; are reather Short in purpotion to the body of the bird.    in this respect very Similar to the partridge.    the covert of the wings and back are of a dove Colour with a Slight admixture of redish brown.    a wide Stripe which extends from Side to Side of the body and occupies the lower region of the breast is beautifully varigated with the brick red white &amp; black which perdominates in the order they are mentioned and the Colours mark the feathers transversely.    the legs are covered with feathers as low as the Knee; these feathers are of dark brown tiped with a dark brick red as are also those between and about the joining of the legs with the body.    the foot is presisely that of the Common partridge except that they are as also the legs white.    the upper beak is Short, wide at it's base, black, convex, curves downwards and reather obtusely pointed.    it exceeds the under chap considerably which is of a white colour, also convex under neath and obtusely pointed.    the nostrils are remarkably Small, placed far back and low down on the Sides of the beak.    they are covered by a thin proterant elastic, black leather like Substance.    the eyes are of a uniform pierceing black colour.    this is a most butifull bird    I preserved the Skin of this bird retaining the wings feet &amp; head which I hope will give a just Idea of the bird.    it's loud note it Single and Consists of a loud Squall, intirely different from the whistling of our partridge or quailes.    it has a chiping note when allarmed like our partridge.—    to day there was a Second of those birds killed which presisely resembles that just discribed.
