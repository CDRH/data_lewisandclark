In order to give <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> time to reach the forks of <a class="regularization" title="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River">Jefferson's river</a> I concluded to spend this day at the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshone</a> Camp and obtain what information I could with rispect to the country.    as we had nothing but a little flour and parched meal to eat except the berries with which the Indians furnished us I directed <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> to hunt a few hours and try to kill something, the Indians furnished them with horses and most of their young men also turned out to hunt.    the game which they principally hunt is the Antelope which they pursue on horseback and shoot with their arrows.    this animal is so extreemly fleet and dureable that a single horse has no possible chance to overtake them or run them down.    the Indians are therefore obliged to have recorce to strategem when they discover a herd of the Antelope they seperate and scatter themselves to the distance of five or six miles in different directions arround them generally scelecting some commanding eminence for a stand; some one or two now pursue the herd at full speed over the hills vallies gullies and the sides of precipices that are tremendious to view. thus after runing them from five to six or seven miles the fresh horses that were in waiting head them and drive them back persuing them as far or perhaps further quite to the other extreem of the hunters who now in turn pursue on their fresh horses thus 〈finally〉 worrying the poor animal down and finally killing them with their arrows.    forty or fifty hunters will be engaged for half a day in this manner and perhaps not kill more than two or three Antelopes.    they have but few Elk or black tailed deer, and the common red deer they cannot take as they secrete themselves in the brush when pursued, and they have only the bow and arrow wich is a very slender dependence for killing any game except such as they can run down with their horses. I was very much entertained with a view of this indian chase; it was after a herd of about 10 Antelope and about 20 hunters.    it lasted about 2 hours and considerable part of the chase in view from my tent.    about 1 A. M. the hunters returned had not killed a single Antelope, and their horses foaming with sweat.    my hunters returned soon after and had been equally unsuccessfull. I now directed <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> to make me a little paist with the flour and added some berries to it which I found very pallateable.</p>
               <p>
The means I had of communicating with these people was by way of <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> who understood perfectly the common language of jesticulation or signs which seems to be universally understood by all the Nations we have yet seen. <a href="#n19081401" id="ln19081401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    it is true that this language is imperfect and liable to error but is much less so than would be expected. <a href="#n19081402" id="ln19081402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    the strong parts of the ideas are seldom mistaken.</p>
               <p>
I now prevailed on the Chief to instruct me with rispect to the geography of his country.    this he undertook very cheerfully, by delienating the rivers on the ground.    but I soon found that his information fell far short of my expectation or wishes.    he drew the river on which we now are to which he placed two branches just above us, <a href="#n19081403" id="ln19081403" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which he shewed me from the openings of the mountains were in view; he next made it discharge itself into a large river which flowed from the S. W. about ten miles below us, <a href="#n19081404" id="ln19081404" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> then continued this joint stream in the same direction of this valley or N. W. for one days march and then enclined it to the West for 2 more days march, here he placed a number of heeps of sand on each side which he informed me represented the vast mountains of rock eternally covered with snow through which the river passed. <a href="#n19081405" id="ln19081405" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>    that the perpendicular and even juting rocks so closely hemned in the river that there was no possibilyte of passing along the shore; that the bed of the river was obstructed by sharp pointed rocks and the rapidity of the stream such that the whole surface of the river was beat into perfect foam as far as the eye could reach.    that the mountains were also inaccessible to man or horse.    he said that this being the state of the country in that direction that himself nor none of his nation had ever been further down the river than these mountains. I then enquired the state of the country on either side of the river but he could not inform me.    he said there was an old man of his nation a days march below who could probably give me some information of the country to the N. W. and refered me to an old man then present for that to the S. W.—    the Chief further informed me that he had understood from the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">persed nosed Indians</a>
                   <a href="#n19081406" id="ln19081406" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> who inhabit this river below the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountains</a> that it ran a great way toward the seting sun and finally lost itself in a great lake of water which was illy taisted, and where the white men lived. I next commenced my enquiries of the old man to whom I had been refered for information relative the country S W. of us.    this he depicted with horrors and obstructions scarcely inferior to that just mentioned.    he informed me that the band of this nation to which he belonged resided at the distance of 20 days march from hence not far from the white people <a href="#n19081407" id="ln19081407" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> with whom they traded for horses mules cloth metal beads and the shells which they woar as orniment being those of a species of perl oister.    that the course to his relations was a little to the West of South.    that in order to get to his relations the first seven days we should be obliged to climb over steep and <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountains</a> where we could find no game to kill nor anything but roots such as a ferce and warlike nation lived on whom he called the <a class="regularization" title="Tukudika Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tukudika%20Indians">broken mockersons</a>
                   <a href="#n19081408" id="ln19081408" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> or <a class="regularization" title="Tukudika Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tukudika%20Indians">mockersons with holes</a>, and said inhabited those mountains and lived like the bear of other countries among the rocks and fed on roots or the flesh of such horses as they could take or steel from those who passed through their country.    that in passing this country the feet of our horses would be so much wounded with the stones many of them would give out.    the next part of the rout was about 10 days through a dry and parched sandy desert <a href="#n19081409" id="ln19081409" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> in which no food at this season for either man or horse, and in which we must suffer if not perish for the want of water.    that the sun had now dryed up the little pools of water which exist through this desert plain in the spring season and had also scorched all the grass.    that no animal inhabited this plain on which we could hope to subsist.    that about the center of this plain a large river passed from S. E. to N. W. which was navigable but afforded neither Salmon nor timber. <a href="#n19081410" id="ln19081410" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>    that beyond this plain thee or four days march his relations lived in a country tolerable fertile and partially covered with timber on another large river which ran in the same direction of the former. <a href="#n19081411" id="ln19081411" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>    that this last discharged itself into a large river <a href="#n19081412" id="ln19081412" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> on which many numerous nations lived with whom his relations were at war but whether this last discharged itself into the great lake or not he did not know.    that from his relations it was yet a great distance to the great or stinking lake as they call the Ocean.    that the way which such of his nation as had been to the Stinking lake traveled was up the river on which they lived and over to that on which the white people lived which last they knew discharged itself into the Ocean, and that this was the way which he would advise me to travel if I was determined to proceed to the Ocean but would advise me to put off the journey untill the next spring when he would conduct me. I thanked him for his information and advise and gave him a knife with which he appeared to be much gratifyed.    from this narative I was convinced that the streams of which he had spoken as runing through the plains and that on which his relations lived were southern branches of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>, heading with the <a class="regularization" title="Rio de los Apostolos" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rio%20de%20los%20Apostolos">rivers Apostles</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Colorado River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Colorado%20River">Collorado</a>, and that the rout he had pointed out was to the <a class="regularization" title="Gulf of California" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Gulf%20of%20California">Vermillion Sea</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Gulf of California" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Gulf%20of%20California">gulph of Callifornia</a>. <a href="#n19081413" id="ln19081413" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> I therefore told him that this rout was more to the South than I wished to travel, and requested to know if there was no rout on the left of this river on which we now are, by means of which, I could intercept it below the mountains through which it passes; but he could not inform me of any except that of the barren plain which he said joined the mountain on that side and through which it was impossible for us to pass at this season even if we were fortunate enough to escape from the <a class="regularization" title="Tukudika Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Tukudika%20Indians">broken mockerson Indians</a>. I now asked <a class="regularization" title="Cameahwait" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cameahwait">Cameahwait</a> by what rout the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Pierced nosed indians</a>, who he informed me inhabited this river below the mountains, came over to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>; this he informed me was to the north, but added that the road was a very bad one as he had been informed by them and that they had suffered excessively with hunger on the rout being obliged to subsist for many days on berries alone as there was no game in that part of the mountains which were broken rockey and so thickly covered with timber that they could scarcely pass.    however knowing that Indians had passed, and did pass, at this season on that side of this river to the same below the mountains, my rout was instantly settled in my own mind, povided the account of this river should prove true on an investigation of it, which I was determined should be made before we would undertake the rout by land in any direction. I felt perfectly satisfyed, that if the Indians could pass these mountains with their women and Children, that we could also pass them; and that if the nations on this river below the mountains were as numerous as they were stated to be that they must have some means of subsistence which it would be equally in our power to procure in the same country.    they informed me that there was no buffaloe on the West side of these mountains; that the game consisted of a few Elk deer and Antelopes, and that the natives subsisted on fish and roots principally.    in this manner I spent the day smoking with them and acquiring what information I could with respect to their country.    they informed me that they could pass to the Spaniards by the way of the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">yellowstone river</a> in 10 days. I can discover that these people are by no means friendly to the Spaniard    their complaint is, that the Spaniards will not let them have fire arms and amunition, <a href="#n19081414" id="ln19081414" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> that they put them off by telling them if they suffer them to have guns they will kill each other, thus leaving them defenceless and an easy prey to their bloodthirsty neighbours to the East of them, who being in possession of fire arms hunt them up and murder them without rispect to sex or age and plunder them of their horses on all occasions.    they told me that to avoid their enemies who were eternally harrassing them that they were obliged to remain in the interior of these mountains at least two thirds of the year where the suffered as we then saw great heardships for the want of food sometimes living for weeks without meat and only a little fish roots and berries.    but this added <a class="regularization" title="Cameahwait" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cameahwait">Cameahwait</a>, with his ferce eyes and lank jaws grown meager for the want of food, would not be the case if we had guns, we could then live in the country of buffaloe and eat as our enimies do and not be compelled to hide ourselves in these mountains and live on roots and berries as the bear do.    we do not fear our enimies when placed on an equal footing with them. I told them that the <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Minnetares</a>
                  <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a> &amp; <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Recares</a> of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> had promised us to desist from making war on them &amp; that we would indevour to find the means of making the <a class="regularization" title="Atsina Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Atsina%20Indians">Minnetares of fort d Prarie</a> or as they call them <a class="regularization" title="Atsina Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Atsina%20Indians">Pahkees</a> desist from waging war against them also.    that after our finally returning to our homes towards the rising sun whitemen would come to them with an abundance of guns and every other article necessary to their defence and comfort, and that they would be enabled to supply themselves with these articles on reasonable terms in exchange for the skins of the beaver Otter and Ermin <a href="#n19081415" id="ln19081415" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> so abundant in their country.    they expressed great pleasure at this information and said they had been long anxious to see the whitemen that traded guns; and that we might rest assured of their friendship and that they would do whatever we wished them. <a href="#n19081416" id="ln19081416" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
I now told <a class="regularization" title="Cameahwait" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cameahwait">Cameahwait</a> that I wished him to speak to his people and engage them to go with me tomorrow to the forks of <a class="regularization" title="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River">Jeffersons river</a> where our baggage was by this time arrived with another Chief and a large party of whitemen who would wait my return at that place.    that I wish them to take with them about 30 spare horses to transport our baggage to this place where we would then remain sometime among them and trade with them for horses, and finally concert our future plans for geting on to the ocean and of the traid which would be extended to them after our return to our homes.    he complyed with my request and made a lengthey harrangue to his village.    he returned in about an hour and a half and informed me that they would be ready to accompany me in the morning. I promised to reward them for their trouble. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> who had had a good view of their horses estimated them at 400. <a href="#n19081417" id="ln19081417" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>    most of them are fine horses.    indeed many of them would make a figure on the South side of <a class="regularization" title="James (Jacque) River (S.

I also saw a bridle bit of spanish manufactary, and sundry other articles which I have no doubt were obtained from the same source.    notwithstanding the extreem poverty of those poor people they are very merry they danced again this evening untill midnight.    each warrior keep one ore more horses tyed by a cord to a take near his lodge both day and night and are always prepared for action at a moments warning.    they fight on horseback altogether.    I observe that the large flies <a href="#n19081418" id="ln19081418" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> are extreemly troublesome to the horses as well as ourselves.</p>
