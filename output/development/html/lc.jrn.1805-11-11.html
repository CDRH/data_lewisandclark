                  <em class="hi">Monday 11th.</em>    The morning was wet and the wind still blowing, so that we could not proceed; we therefore built large fires and made our situation as comfortable as possible, but still bad enough, as we have no tents, or covering to defend us, except our blankets and some mats we got from the Indians, which we put on poles to keep off the rain. It continued raining and blowing all day; and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon the tide was so high that we had to leave our lodges, until it got lower in the evening. Some of the men went about 40 perches <a href="#n25111105" id="ln25111105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> up the river and caught 15 fine large fish.

Monday Novemr 11th    It rained hard the greater part of last night, which made it very disagreeable to us all.    The greater part of our Men had nothing to shelter them from the rain, &amp; were obliged to lay down in it, &amp; their Cloathes were wet through.    This morning continued wet &amp; rainey, the wind was high, &amp; the swell in the river ran very high, &amp; We did not attempt to move from this place.—</p>
               <p>
About 4 o'Clock P. M. 4 Indians came down the river in a Canoe, &amp; halted at where we were encamp'd.    They had a quantity of fresh Salmon trout, &amp;  some Roots &amp;ca    We purchased from them some of the Salmon trout. They informed us by signs that they were going down to the Mouth of the River, to trade with white people; &amp; mention'd in english the name of a particular white Man who they called <a class="regularization" title="Hill, Samuel or William Shaler" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hill%2C%20Samuel%20or%20William%20Shaler">Mr. Haley</a>, &amp; made signs to us that they traded with him.    These Indians staid but a short time with us, &amp; then set out.    they crossed to the other side of the River with their Canoes, through high waves &amp; breakers, which we all consider'd too dangerous to attempt. Some of our party Shot &amp; gigged 16 Salmon trout in a Creek, a short distance above our Camp.—
