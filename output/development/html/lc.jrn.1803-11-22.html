The old forest bed of the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> is a lens of peaty material that contains a large amount of partly coalified wood that retains its bark. It was buried in muds along the river during one of the interglacial ages prior to the Wisconsin glaciation. The <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> should have had a similar alluvial history, so it would be reasonable that such a bed would be encountered here also.
