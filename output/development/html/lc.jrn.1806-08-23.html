                  <span class="italic">Saturday 23rd.</span>    We set out early in a fine morning, but the wind was high; and we went on very well till near noon, when the wind blew so hard that we had to halt, and were detained about four hours. Three hunters <a href="#n39082304" id="ln39082304" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> went on ahead by land, and when we had overtaken them they had killed two elk and some deer, and we halted to take in the meat. Here we had a very heavy shower of rain, which detained us another hour. We encamped at night and found the musquitoes very troublesome.
