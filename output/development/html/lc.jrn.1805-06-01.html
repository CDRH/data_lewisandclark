The moring was cloudy and a few drops of rain. Set out at an early hour and proceeded as usual by the help of our chords.    the river Clifts and bluffs not so high as yesterday and the country becomes more level.    a mountain or a part of the N. Mountain appears to approach the river within 8 or 10 ms. bearing N. from our encampment of the last evening. <a href="#n14060101" id="ln14060101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Capt C. who walked on shore today informed me that the river hills were much lower than usual and that from the tops of those hills he had a delightfull view of rich level and extensive plains on both sides of the river; in those plains, which in many places reach the river clifts, he observed large banks of pure sand which appeared to have been d[r]iven by the S W. winds from the river bluffs and there deposited. <a href="#n14060102" id="ln14060102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    the plains are more fertile at some distance from the river than near the bluffs where the surface of the earth is very generally covered with small smothe pebbles which have the appearance of having been woarn by the agitation of the waters in which they were no doubt once immerced. <a href="#n14060103" id="ln14060103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> A range of high Mountains appear to the S. W. at a considerable distance covered with snow, they appear to run Westerly. <a href="#n14060104" id="ln14060104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> no timber appears on the highlands; but much more than yesterday on the river and Islands.    rockey points and shoals less freequent than yesterday but some of them quite as bad when they did occur.    the river from 2 to 400 yards wide, courant more gentle and still becoming clearer.    game is by no means as abundant as
below; we killed one male bighorn and a mule deer today; saw buffalow at a distance in the plains particularly near a small Lake on Lard. side about 8 ms. distant.    some few drops of rain again fell this evening.    we passed six Islands and encamped on the 7th; <a href="#n14060105" id="ln14060105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> they are all small but contain some timber.    the wind has been against us all day.—    I saw the choke cherry the yellow and red courant bushes; the wild rose appears now to be in full bloom as are also the prickley pear which are numerous in these plains.— <a href="#n14060106" id="ln14060106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>    We also saw some Indian Lodges of sticks today which did not appear to have been long evacuated.—    some coal appear in the bluffs.</p>
