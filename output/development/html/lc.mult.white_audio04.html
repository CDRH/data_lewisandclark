               This span of time is so immense that it forces us to reconsider how small a portion of the history we know today. It compels us to face the depth of misunderstanding that is perpetuated when we are told, over and over again, that the Lewis and Clark expedition marks the beginning of western U.S. history. For in fact, the entire period since 1800 comprises little more than one percent of the history of the Salish and Pend d'Oreille people.</p>
            <p>
               If we were to represent this timeline as a single twenty-four-hour day, Lewis and Clark would arrive at about 11:28 P.M.â€”about half an hour before midnight.</p>
