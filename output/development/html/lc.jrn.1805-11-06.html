Wednesday Novemr. 6th    We had several showers of rain during last night; Our officers placed a guard on our Canoes during the night, to attend them, the tide rising &amp; falling 3 feet perpendicular.    This morning was cloudy &amp; wet.    We set off early, &amp; proceeded on our Voyage.    We passed a small Indian Village, which lay on the South side of the River.    Some Indians came to us in Canoes; from whom we purchased some fresh fish of different kinds, And also purchased, some Roots from 〈some〉 Indians who over took us in Canoes; &amp; were going down the River with loads of this root &amp;ca to trade.    About noon, we halted to dine, at a large bottom, which was 
covered with Cotton wood Trees, lying on the South side of the River.    several of our hunters went out for about an hour, &amp; found the underbrush growing so thick; that they could not go any distance.—    We continued on, &amp; passed high Clifts of rocks lying on the South side of the River, which were about 100 feet high, from the surface of the Water, &amp; hills on both sides of the River, covered with different kind of Pine &amp; White Cedar, &amp; a wood called Abervity, Red wood <a href="#n25110623" id="ln25110623" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> &amp;ca.—</p>
