There are so many paths leading to and from this spring, that our guide took a wrong one for a mile or two, and we had bad travelling across till we got into the road again. At noon we halted. Game is scarce; and 
our hunters killed nothing since yesterday morning; though 4 of the best were constantly out, and every one of them furnished with a good horse. While we remained here, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> and the men, who had been left with him, came up; but had not found the horse.

along it, &amp; this Meadow lay near to the Spring, &amp; a small distance above it—    We could not get along the Indian trail, for the timber that had been blown down in a thicket of Pine &amp; other Trees.—    We went round this falling timber, and round a hill, and got into the road again.    We proceeded on our Journey 'till about 11 o'Clock A.
