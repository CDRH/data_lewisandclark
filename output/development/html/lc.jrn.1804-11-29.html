                  <em class="hi">Thursday 29th.</em>    This day was clear, but cold. We went to unrig the boat, and by an accident one of the sergeants had his shoulder dislocated. <a href="#n08112902" id="ln08112902" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The 30th the weather continued the same. Early in the morning of this day we saw an Indian on the opposite side of the river, and brought him over. He informed us that, a few days ago, eight of his nation were out hunting, and were attacked by a party of the <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians">Sioux</a> tribe, who killed one and wounded two more; and also carried off their horses. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> and twenty-three men immediately set out with an intention of pursuing the murderers. They went up to the first village of the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a>, but their warriors did not seem disposed to turn out. They suggested the coldness of the weather; that the <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians">Sioux</a> were too far gone to be overtaken; and put off the expedition to the spring of the year. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> and his party returned the same evening to the fort.

Now this is probably near the longitude of the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages; for as it appears by the above statement, and by other observations of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> nearer the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, that the course up the river is, for a considerable distance, nearly due west, and afterwards nearly due north, the difference of longitude and latitude, between the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and the point where <a class="regularization" title="Thompson, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Thompson%2C%20David">Mr. Thompson</a> took his observations, may be added together, in estimating the distance: and this will give about 8½ degrees of latitude [a]nd 9 degrees of longitude making in the whole 17½ degrees, which from the very meandring course of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, may be sufficient to include 1610 miles of it, the distance from the mouth to the villages.
