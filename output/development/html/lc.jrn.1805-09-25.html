                  <em class="hi">Wednesday 25th.</em>    A fine, pleasant, warm morning. The hunters went out early and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> rode out to see if there were any trees to be found large enough for canoes. The men in general appear to be getting much better; but <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> is very sick and taking medicine; and myself and two or three of the men are yet very unwell. The climate here is warm; and the heat to day was as great as we had experienced at any time during the summer. The water also is soft and warm, and perhaps causes our indisposition more than any thing else. In the evening <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> returned to camp, having discovered a place about 5 or 6 miles down the river, where a large branch 
comes in on the north side that will furnish timber large enough for our purpose. Our hunters also came in, and had killed nothing but a small panther <a href="#n22092504" id="ln22092504" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and a pheasant. The man who had remained at the first village came up.
