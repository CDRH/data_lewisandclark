               <p>
The <em class="hi">Mule Deer</em>
                   <a href="#n28031106" id="ln28031106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> we have never found except in rough Country; they prefer the Open Grounds and are Seldom found in the wood lands near the river; when they are met with in the wood lands or river bottoms and pursued, they imediately run to the hills or open country as the Elk do, the Contrary happens with the common Deer.    there are Several differences between the mule and common deer as well as in form as in habits.    they are fully a third larger in general, and the male is particularly large; think there is Somewhat greater disparity of Size between the Male and Female of this Species than there is between the male and female fallow Deer; I am Convinced I have Seen a Buck of this Species twice the volume a Buck of the Common Deer.    the Ears are peculiarly large, I measured those of a large Buck 〈of this Species〉 which I found to be <em class="hi">eleven</em> inches long and 3½ in width at the widest part; they are not so delicately formed, their hair in winter is thicker longer and of a much darker grey, in Summer the hair is Still coarser longer and of a paler red, more like that of the Elk; in winter they also have a Considerable quantity of very fine wool intermixed with the hair and lying next to the Skin as the Antelope has.    the long hair which grows on the outer Side of the first joint of the hind legs, and which in the Common Deer do not usially occupy more than 2 inches in them occupy from 6 to 8; their horns also differ, those in the Common deer consist of two main beams gradually deminishing as the points proceed from it, with the mule deer the horns consist of two beams which at the distance of 4 or 6 inches from the head divide themselves into two equal branches which again either divide into two other equal branches or terminate in a Smaller, and two equal ones; haveing either 2, 4 or 6 points on a beam; the horn is not so rough about the base as the common deer, and are invariably of a much darker Colour. the most Strikeing differance of all, is the white rump and tail.    from the root of the tail as a center there is a circular Spot perfectly white of about 3½ inches radius, which occupy a part of the rump and the extremities of buttocks and joins the white of the belley underneath; the tail which is usially from 8 to 9 inches long for the first 4 or 5 inches from its upper extremity is covered with Short white hairs, much Shorter indeed than those hairs of the body; from hence for about one inch further, the hair is Still white but gradually becoms longer; the tail then termonates in a tissue of Black hair of about 3 inches long.    from this black hair of the tail they have obtained among the French engages the appelation of the <em class="hi">black tailed Deer</em>, but this I conceive by no means Characteristic of the Animal as much the larger portion of the tail is white.    the Ears and the tail of this Animale when Compared with those of the Common Deer, So well Comported with those of the <em class="hi">Mule</em> when compared with the Horse, that we have by way of distinction adapted the appellation of the mule Deer <a href="#n28031107" id="ln28031107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which I think much more appropriate.    on the inner corner of each eye there is a drane (like the Elk) or large recepticle which Seams to Answer as a drane to the eye which givs it the appearance of weeping, this in the Common Deer of the Atlantic States is scercely proceptable but becoms more Conspicious in the fallow Deer, and Still more So in the Elk; this recepticle in the Elk is larger than any of the Pecora order <a href="#n28031108" id="ln28031108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> with which I am acquainted.</p>
