A fine morning, set out at an early hour.    one Beaver caught this morning by two traps, having a foot in each; the traps belonged to different individuals, between whom, a contest ensued, which would have terminated, most probably, in a serious rencounter had not our timely arrival at the place prevented it.    after breakfast this morning, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> walked on Stad. shore, while the party were assending by means of their toe lines, I walked with them on the bank; found a species of pea bearing a yellow flower, and now in blume; it seldom rises more than 6 inches high, the leaf &amp; stalk resembles that of the common gardin pea, the root is pirenial. <a href="#n11041801" id="ln11041801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (See specimen of vegitables No. 3.) I also saw several parsels of buffaloe's hair hanging on the rose bushes, <a href="#n11041802" id="ln11041802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which had been bleached by exposure to the weather and became perfectly white.    it every appearance of the wool of the sheep, tho' much finer and more silkey and soft. I am confident that an excellent cloth may be made of the wool of the Buffaloe. the Buffaloe I killed yesterday had cast his long hare, and the poil <a href="#n11041803" id="ln11041803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which remained was very thick, fine, and about 2 inches in length. I think this anamal would have furnished about five pounds of wool.    we were detained today from one to five P. M. in consequence of the wind which blew so violently from N. that it was with difficulty we could keep the canoes from filling with water altho' they were along shore; I had them secured by placing the perogues on the out side of them in such manner as to break the waves off them.    at 5 we proceed, and shortly after met with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a>, who had killed an Elk and a deer and was wating our arrival.    we took the meat on board and continued our march untill nearly dark when we came too on the Stard side under a boald welltimbered bank which sheltered us from the wind which had abated but not yet ceased.    here we encamped, <a href="#n11041804" id="ln11041804" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> it being the extremity of the last course of this day.—</p>
