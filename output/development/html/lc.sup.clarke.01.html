            <h3>DAYTON DUNCAN<br/>
               <br/> Introduction to the Bison Books Edition</h3>
            <p>A few years ago I was helping my friend Stephen Ambrose lead a group of people along
               some of the most scenic stretches of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail. On a warm summer evening, after a
               pleasant day of paddling canoes on the Missouri River, we camped amid the eerie and
               majestic White Cliffs of north-central Montana, close to the exact spot where, or 31
               May 1805, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> wrote
               one of his most lyrical journal passages about the wondrous landscape he and his men
               were encountering with such fresh eyes. "As we passed on," Lewis concluded, "it
               seemed as if those seens of visionary inchantment would never have an end."</p>
            <p>Nearly two centuries later we found the enchantment equally palpable as we sat around
               the campfire and gazed at the silent cliffs reflected in the river, tinged pink by
               the setting sun. There were about thirty of us in the group, roughly the same number
               as in the original Corps of Discovery. Beyond that one feature of our trip–and
               our geographical location–most of the similarities between the two expeditions
               ended. On average our group's members were about thirty years older than the young
               men under the command of Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> (along with one teenaged Indian woman and her infant son). We had
               paddled <em class="hi">down</em>stream to our camp (which was tiring enough for
               people our age), but nothing we did could be compared to dragging bulky dugouts day
               in and day out against the Missouri's relentless current. Unlike the Corps of
               Discovery, we felt no concerns about grizzly bears (they disappeared from the river a
               century ago), getting lost (we had precise maps and an experienced outfitter), or
               finding horses when the canoe portion of our journey ended (a chartered bus was hired
               to take us back to our parked cars). Having studied the history of the expedition in
               some detail, we also had made sure of another important difference: unlike the Corps
               of Discovery, we were absolutely <em class="hi">not</em> going to run out of
               whiskey.</p>
            <p>That evening, after Steve and I took turns reading aloud from the journals, he spoke
               for a few minutes about teamwork. It's a point he had eloquently made three years
               earlier in the documentary film Ken Burns and I produced for public television: how
               after so many days together in their struggle to cross the continent, members of the
               Corps of Discovery eventually became so close to one another that they could hear a
               cough in the night and know who it was; they could recognize the sound of each
               other's footsteps; they knew who was best at hunting, at starting a fire, or at any
               other task; they even knew who liked salt on his meat and who didn't. Such detailed
               knowledge about everyone else's personal habits and strengths—a simultaneous
               acknowledgment of individuality within a group that itself has begun to act as a
               single, organic unit—is the natural byproduct of the intimate bond of teamwork
               so crucial to the success of any expedition.</p>
            <p>Everyone around the campfire nodded in agreement, then headed for their sleeping
               bags. The next morning I told Steve he could add another item of familiarity to his
               list. After only one night of camping together, I said, we already knew who snored
               and who didn't—and we would be pitching our tents accordingly for the remainder
               of the trip.</p>
            <p>Did any members of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition snore? If so, which ones? Was it a gentle sawing sound
               that encouraged the others to sleep, like the croaking of frogs on a riverbank? Or
               was it a series of erratically erupting snorts and rasps, perhaps even a grand anvil
               chorus of a dozen or more men that reverberated out of the tents, echoed over the
               hills, and alarmed the wild beasts of the Plains? Did their non-snoring campmates
               ponder (as that other great American adventurer Huckleberry Finn would have) the
               age-old conundrum, the "curiosest thing in the world": why is the snorer, the person
               closest to the sound, the only one left undisturbed by his snoring? Did they kick or
               shove or toss sticks at the offender? Or did they simply lie there, wide awake and
               murderously sleep deprived, silently calculating how hard it would be to slip a few
               doses of Rush's Thunderbolts (that super-powered laxative) into someone's
               breakfast?</p>
            <p>We don't know the answers to these questions because the primary source of
               information, the expedition's journals, doesn't provide them. But it's a safe bet
               that every single member of the Corps of Discovery could have answered them, and
               probably in elaborate detail.</p>
            <p>The men considered some specific disruptions of their slumber important enough to
               mention in their journals. The night before the expedition entered the White Cliffs,
               for instance, a buffalo bull stampeded into the sleeping camp, rampaged around the
               four fires, bent a rifle and one of the blunderbusses with its pounding hooves, and,
               according to <span class="tei_name">Sgt. John Ordway</span>, came
               "within a flew Inches of Several mens heads" before Lewis's dog, <span class="tei_name">Seaman</span>, chased it away. "It was Supposed," <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> added, that "if he had trod on a man it would
               have killed him dead."' This puts the issue of being awakened by snoring in a
               different perspective. Or consider the night of 26 July 1806, on the Corps's return
               trip, when a vicious wolf sank its fangs into the hand of Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Nathaniel Pryor</span> the kind of disturbance that
               might rouse anyone from even the deepest of dreams.</p>
            <p>Both captains reported times when the worries of leadership prevented them from
               sleeping: <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, when the
               entire crew was required to spend the night on their keelboat, surrounded by hundreds
               of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> warriors;
               Lewis, when he camped near Lemhi Pass with a band of <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span>s, whom he feared were about to abandon him
               before he could purchase any of their desperately needed horses. <span class="tei_name">Seaman</span> the dog had his own share of what Lewis called
               "wristless nights"–constantly patrolling the campsites after dark in bear
               country to warn the men of approaching grizzlies, as if the responsibility to allow
               others some wellearned rest was his alone.</p>
            <p>Most other recorded bouts with insomnia, though far less dramatic, are nonetheless
               helpful in providing a fuller picture of the expedition's experience. At a site west
               of the Yellowstone River the beaver were so numerous that the slapping of their tails
               on the water kept some men from nodding off; near the mouth of the Columbia the huge
               and noisy flocks of geese and brants had done the same thing. Along the Missouri
               mosquitoes caused at least two sleepless nights (and probably innumerable others
               unrecorded); fleas were the problem at Fort Clatsop. Among the Nez Percés in Idaho,
               after the nearly starved men had unadvisedly gorged themselves on salmon and camas
               root, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dutifully noted in his
               journal that the feast "filled us so full of wind, that we were scercely able to
               Breathe all night" (and then, thankfully, he left additional details of the evening
               to the imagination).</p>
            <p>But nowhere in the journals–among the hundreds of thousands of words that
               chronicle every day of the historic two-and-a-half-year expedition that brim with a
               remarkable accumulation of information—do we learn who among the Corps of
               Discovery snored his way across the continent and back.</p>
            <p>Obviously the issues of sleep and snoring are not the most critical points of
               consideration in the epic journey of Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and their fellow explorers. But they do lead to
               larger, more important ones.</p>
            <p>First, despite the incredible wealth of detail in the expedition's journals, much
               went unrecorded for posterity. (This is not so much a complaint as an observation.)
               Embarked as they were on an arduous trek into unmapped territory, where every bend in
               the river and every new horizon might spell discouragement, disaster, or defeat, the
               insistent priorities of mere survival could easily have overwhelmed the more prosaic
               task of taking pen to paper every evening. That they wrote at all—let alone
               created such an enduring classic among the annals of exploration—stands as a
               stunning achievement in itself, a testament both to <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span>'s farsighted instructions that
               "your observations are to be taken with great pains &amp; accuracy, to be entered
               distinctly &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself," and to their diligence
               in carrying out those orders, even in the most difficult situations.</p>
            <p>Journals from six men have survived: those of Captains Meriwether Lewis and <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, Sergeants <span class="tei_name">John Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Charles Floyd</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Private Joseph Whitehouse</span>. Taken together their
               commentaries leave no day of the expedition unrecorded, and for most days provide
               multiple perspectives from which to triangulate events. In addition, Sergeant <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and <span class="tei_name">Private Robert Frazer</span> are presumed to have kept
               journals as well, as yet unrecovered. What has been lost from not hearing their
               voices? How much more would we learn from the personal accounts of others on the
               expedition, such as <span class="tei_name">York</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s black slave; or <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, the young <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span> woman, and Charbonneau, her French Canadian
               husband; or the other enlisted men? It's impossible to tell.</p>
            <p>This leads to a second issue: the nature of the journals themselves. These are not
               the diaries of teenage girls, full of emotion and juicy gossip, meant as an outlet
               for personal feelings and destined to be kept under lock and key for fear of
               embarrassment. Nor are they the journals of mature adults as we might expect them to
               be written today, recording a day's activities as a springboard for someone's
               innermost thoughts and contemplations. These are the journals of busy military men
               writing under orders from the president of the United States, recording information
               meant to be useful to him and the rest of the "civilized world," and fully
               anticipating that what they set down would be published in some form or another. In
               other words, the more personal the informationfrom the trivial (naming names about
               snoring habits) to the profound (private desires and misgivings, or frank assessments
               of another expedition member's strengths and weaknesses)—the less likely the
               Corps of Discovery's chroniclers are to reveal it.</p>
            <p>On a few occasions Lewis displays a histrionic yearning for glory or alternately
               provides brief glimpses into the darker recesses of his soul. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sometimes whines about his health or exhibits a
               fatherly concern for the welfare of his men. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s descriptions of the most dangerous moments come the closest to
               expressing outright fear, just as his entries about Christmas and his longing to
               return home seem the most heartfelt. In general, though, the information the journals
               provide exists within a fairly narrow range: miles traveled, the day's weather,
               locations of campsites, new species and new landscapes encountered, Indian tribes met
               and the prospects for trade, brief accountings of the day's highlights, and soon. All
               the things, in other words, that Mr. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> so anxiously awaited. He wasn't interested in reading a novel of
               western adventure, he wanted facts. The Corps of Discovery obeyed by returning with a
               prodigious number of them.</p>
            <p>If <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had added in his
               instructions to "Take equal pains to tell us more about yourselves and your traveling
               companions, your own habits, beliefs, and customs, &amp;c.," the journalists might
               possibly have taken a soldierly stab at it–though it is as difficult to imagine
               them doing so with much enthusiasm as it is to imagine the shy and secretive
               president wanting that kind of information in the first place. His priorities were
               clear: he wanted facts, not story.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, from the unelaborated facts alone a dramatic narrative emerges, one
               that is chock full of more heart-pounding near misses than most novels of the day
               would have dared attempt: a crumbling riverbank nearly overwhelms the keelboat; Lewis
               nearly falls to his death from a cliff; a confrontation with the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
               <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> nearly turns deadly for
               both sides; men nearly freeze to death on the northern Plains; buffaloes nearly
               trample them and grizzly bears nearly catch them; a pirogue containing the most
               valuable cargo nearly capsizes; the expedition nearly takes a disastrous turn up the
               wrong river; a violent hailstorm nearly kills some of the men, while a flash flood
               nearly sweeps <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to his death;
                  <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> nearly dies from sickness;
               her people, the <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span>s
               (with their all-important horses), nearly abandon Lewis; while crossing the
               Bitterroot Range, nearly lost, everyone nearly starves; the Nez Percés nearly
               decide to kill rather than befriend the weak and starving strangers; Columbia River
               cascades and then ocean swells nearly swamp the small flotilla of dugout canoes;
               Blackfeet warriors nearly leave Lewis and a few companions horseless and gunless in
               hostile territory;, Lewis is shot and nearly killed in a hunting accident. (And,
               unbeknownst to the expedition, Spanish war parties dispatched for their destruction
               nearly intercept them.)</p>
            <p>Just as facts overshadow feelings and personalities in the journals, the repetitive
               drumbeat of dramatic moments eventually drowns out the details of the more mundane
               day-to-day routines and the quiet heroics of getting up each morning for yet another
               exhausting day of moving only a few miles more across a seemingly endless continent.
               What is captured in the bargain is undoubtedly the most important information, as
               well as the most stirring moments. But what is lost is a fuller sense of the
               participants in this historic event, and perhaps some greater insights the
               participants in this historic event, and perhaps some greater insights into how they
               succeeded so spectacularly. It's like reading an intricately plotted, action-packed,
               and highly informative novel that is sadly populated by rather featureless
               characters, or embarking on an epic adventure without really getting to know everyone
               else along on the trip.</p>
            <p>Exacerbating the problem with all this lost potential is the way in which the
               captains overshadow everyone else. From the very start the historic enterprise tended
               to be viewed from the top down. President <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, for instance, always considered it the "Lewis Expedition,"
               reflecting his notion that Lewis was the only one to whom he had delegated authority
               and who therefore was solely responsible for the journey's outcome. Lewis knew
               better. He was the first to add <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
               to the expedition's name, and always insisted that his trusted friend shared in the
               fame (just as he had shared in the decision making throughout the hard journey). So
               successful were these two remarkable leaders at melding their talents that they now
               seem historically joined at the hip, two quite different men who cast an even larger
               shadow because they stand together. They are unquestionably the "stars" of the story
               and the ones we most easily recognize, not only because they were the leaders but
               also because they are the story's principal narrators. Despite the existence of other
               journals, we turn to the captains' version of events first.</p>
            <p>From time to time in the story a few other members of the expedition threaten to
               emerge as personalities in their own right, however fleetingly. The lavish attentions
               and honor which Indians paid to <span class="tei_name">York</span> because of
               his black skin prompt the journalists to take note of it, too, although for most of
               the expedition his presence–and its social ramifications–goes unremarked.
               Did some of the men (many from slave-holding states) resent those attentions? Did any
               consider him their friend and equal? What were <span class="tei_name">York</span>'s thoughts? As they all paddled furiously down the Missouri toward
               home in 1806, did he expect that whatever newly found freedoms he had gained from the
               journey (if indeed any were gained) would be extended to him once they reached St.
               Louis?</p>
            <p>Similar questions could be asked–and left unanswered–about <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, the only woman, mother, and
               full-blood Indian on the expedition. She figures prominently in some of the more
               dramatic moments (such as the near capsizing of the white pirogue and, of course, the
                  <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span> negotiations
               with a chief who miraculously turns out to be her brother), and we get a few hints at
               her character (such as when she insists on being taken to see the beached whale on
               the Oregon coast, or when she presents <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with a Christmas present of two dozen white weasel tails). But she
               is absent from the recorded story as often as she is in it, and her point of view is
               available only through speculation.</p>
            <p>What <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and <span class="tei_name">York</span> have in common–and, to a lesser extent, what
               Charbonneau, <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> (a
               mixed-blood of French and Shawnee descent), the baby Jean Baptiste, and even what the
               dog, <span class="tei_name">Seaman</span>, also share–is what sets
               them apart from those we call simply "the men." That's merely another way of saying
               "everyone else." While these few stand out as individual characters in the saga, most
               often "the men" come across as an undifferentiated whole, a single unit comprised of
               interchangeable parts rather than a collection of individuals, each one with his own
               distinct personality, his own foibles and strengths, his own role to play, his own
               unique perspective on the larger experience. History has tended to lump them all
               together as "the men" and left it at that.</p>
            <p>Clearly <em class="hi">they</em> didn't see it that way. As military men they
               recognized the authority and leadership of their captains and no doubt accepted the
               enterprise as the "Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
               Expedition." But as human beings (and, equally pertinent, as Americans in the first
               generation of independence), each man surely considered it his expedition–in
               experience if not in name. "The men" were individuals with individual names,
               individual attributes, and individual stories to tell.</p>
            <p>Charles <span class="tei_name">Clarke</span>'s <em class="hi">Men of the Lewis &amp; <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                  Expedition</em>, first published in 1970, was one of the first to remind the world
               of that selfevident but too-often-overlooked fact. As he wrote in his introduction,
                  <span class="tei_name">Clarke</span>'s purpose was to "bring
               these men into being again and to rescue them from oblivion so far as is possible at
               this late date." <em class="hi">So far as is possible at this late date</em>.
               Unfortunately, for the many reasons mentioned–the missing voices, the
               circumscribed nature of the journals' focus, the dominance of the captains (and a few
               others) as individual characters–what is "possible at this late date" carries
               special weight and places severe constraints on a noble (and eloquently stated) goal.
               If "the men" have not exactly been fully brought back into being again in these
               pages, the reason is a simple lack of documentary raw material.</p>
            <p>But they can be rescued from complete oblivion. By providing biographical sketches of
               fifty-one expedition members and then arranging a synopsis of each day's events with
               an emphasis on those things directly relating to each of the members, Charles <span class="tei_name">Clarke</span> performed a valuable service. One
               by one "the men" struggle to emerge as the individuals they surely must have been.
               Yet the facts–or, more precisely, the lack of enough facts–constantly
               limit their complete resuscitation. Enough exists to reassemble a skeleton and
               perhaps a bit of flesh, but, <em class="hi">so far as is possible at this late
                  date</em>, breathing real life and blood into them is now probably best left to
               historical novelists. As for the rest of us, we can string together the available
               facts about an individual expedition member to hint at a fuller portrait and, with a
               little imagination, at least point ourselves toward a fuller understanding of what it
               must have been like to be a member of the greatest expedition in American history. </p>
            <p>Consider, for instance, one of my personal favorites, Alexander Hamilton <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>, one of the many men about
               whom there is more that we don't know than what we do know. Born along the
               Connecticut River in Charlestown, New Hampshire (just a few miles from my home),
                  <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> was twenty-five years
               old, apparently a skilled blacksmith, and a private in the army when he joined the
               Corps of Discovery at its camp in Illinois during the winter of 1803–1804. What
               prompted <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> to volunteer for
               the expedition? How did he fit in with the other young men who tended toward
               rabble-rousing that first winter? What did he expect for the journey? (Fevered
               excitement? foreboding? feigned ambivalence?) These are all unknown. Aside from a few
               passing references–a jumbled list of recruits, a notation of who got drunk on
               New Year's Eve, the mention of bringing in a pair of hinges–<span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s name rarely appears in the early months
               of the journals.</p>
            <p>As the expedition began its ascent up the Missouri, it appears <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> spent at least some days on shore riding
               horseback with George <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>,
               the expedition's chief scout and best hunter, which suggests that the captains
               recognized in him some level of competence with a gun and horses. Someone raised
               along the Connecticut would have been familiar with rivers, but the mighty Missouri's
               size, power, and soon-to- be-legendary treachery must have amazed <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>. Perhaps he was thankful to be assigned to
               hunting duty rather than fighting the Big Muddy with the others. Did he and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> exchange stories from
               their very different backgrounds? Was there an implicit competition between them over
               who supplied the most fresh meat to the hungry men? Did the primeval hardwood forests
               of Missouri, with their majestic stands of hickory and oak, hearken him back to the
               gentle hills of New Hampshire, blanketed with trees as they might have been when
                  <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s ancestors first
               arrived in New England? We can speculate but we cannot know. The journals only report
               for certain that he and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> were responsible for the horses in late May, that on at least
               one occasion he and other hunters killed three fat elk bulls, and that, in the
               organization of the party, he was assigned to the squad of <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Ordway</span>, a fellow New Hampshire native. It takes
               a careful reading of the early journals to be even aware of <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s presence.</p>
            <p>But on 12 July 1804, at Camp New Island, just north of what is now the
               Kansas-Nebraska line, <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>
               burst onto center stage in the expedition's narrative. He did it, ironically enough,
               by sleeping. During the first months of the expedition the captains had worked to
               instill military discipline on a group of young men who seem to have been
               particularly reluctant to accept it. There were cases of drunkenness (<span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s had been but one of many
               such infractions), open disobedience, men going AWOL, and night guards helping
               themselves to supplies (that is, the whiskey). In each case Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had convened a court-martial of
               enlisted men to hear the charges, judge the facts, and mete out punishments, usually
               consisting of fifty lashes.</p>
            <p>On 12 July, however, the captains themselves composed the courtmartial because of the
               seriousness of the offense: falling asleep while on night guard duty, the kind of
               lapse that might endanger the entire expedition's survival in the wrong circumstance
               and obviously something Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted to make sure never happened again. The few facts we know of
               the incident are confined to the four terse paragraphs Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> entered in the expedition's orderly book: <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> had been assigned as night
               sentinel the previous evening; his sergeant, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, accused him of "lying down and Sleeping on his post"; the offense
               was considered "<em class="hi">Capatol Crimes</em>, and under the rules and
               articles of <em class="hi">War</em> punishable by <em class="hi">Death</em>."
               Acting in his own defense, the report says, <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> made what I would consider to be the first
               attempt at a plea bargain west of the Mississippi River: "<em class="hi">Guilty of
                  Lying Down, and not Guilty of Going to Sleep</em>."</p>
            <p>Whether he had actually been asleep a few hours earlier (as charged) or not (as he
               claimed), <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> must surely
               have been fully alert during these proceedings. His life potentially hung in the
               balance as the captains weighed their decision and then announced it: guilty of both
               charges. An extra jolt of adrenaline must have rushed through his system in the brief
               moment between verdict and sentencing: not execution (obvious relief) but one hundred
               lashes on the bare back (a quick, reflexive tensing of shoulder muscles) to be
               administered in equal amounts over four nights.</p>
            <p>It would be interesting–and informative–to know the other men's reaction
               to the trial, the verdict, and the next four evenings at each successive campsite,
               when <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> would have stepped
               forward to strip down his shirt and turn his face away to receive his nightly dose of
               twenty-five lashes. Perhaps some of the men, by now friends since spending seven
               months together, turned their faces away too. Maybe others relished the sight,
               harboring either some personal grudge against <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> or a belief that he truly had endangered
               their survival and deserved a stricter punishment. Once again the journals are of no
               help in creating a complete sense of the event. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span> make
               no mention whatsoever of the court martial, let alone the nightly lashings. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> devotes only a single sentence to
               the incident ("one Sentinel a Sleep on his post last night, and tried by court
               martial this day"), omitting not only that <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> was the accused but that <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> himself was the accuser. Is the
               near silence about the matter in the enlisted men's diaries significant? It's
               impossible to say.</p>
            <p>Equally lost to history is <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s point of view. If wrongly accused he could have been justifiably
               resentful toward his sergeant and commanding officers; if caught "fair and square" he
               might have considered himself properly chastised, perhaps even lucky to have escaped
               with whatever skin was left on his back at the end of the fourth evening. Did Lewis
               (the chief dispenser of medicine) treat <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s wounds each night? Did the floggings leave lasting scars? Was
                  <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> comforted or shunned
               by his mates during the next few days? Was he brought back into the company of men
               with, perhaps, a few jokes, a friendly word, a helping hand during a task made
               difficult by a sore back? Answers to those questions would explain much about the
               dynamics of the Corps of Discovery–between the commanders and their men,
               between noncommissioned officers and their squads, within the group as a whole, or
               between individual members–but we could answer them only if we had more
               details. Instead we are left to wonder, extrapolate, speculate, yearn for fuller
               information, and, in the end, be thankful for the few facts we do have from which to
               populate this epic expedition with more than simply names on a list.</p>
            <p>We know with certainty that July 1804 was not a good month for Private <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>, because he surfaces next in
               the joumals on 29 July when he was dispatched back to the previous night's campsite
               to retrieve a tomahawk he had forgotten, and then, while crossing a creek on a log,
               had lost his balance and dropped his rifle into the deep water. We know also that
                  <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span> was sent out to rescue
               the gun from the creek's muddy bottom. <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> probably never forgot that humiliating day: the look in the
               captains' eyes or the sounds of their voices after he admitted to misplacing his
               tomahawk; the long walk to retrieve it; the moment on the log when he thought he
               would fall in, and the next moment, right after dropping his rifle, when he probably
               wished he had; the sight of <span class="tei_name">Reuben
                  Field</span> disappearing underwater and his reappearance moments later with the
               prize; the talk and the looks of the other men when he and his sodden companion
               returned to camp and retold the story; the sinking feeling that perhaps he shouldn't
               have volunteered for the expedition in the first place. Regardless of how memorable
               that day was for <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>, the
               journals' mention of his part in it slides by in a few short sentences. We are told
               more about the weather (dark with occasional rain, cold wind from the WNW, the state
               of the river (more bends and slower current north of the Platte, the banks lined
               mostly with cottonwoods now, many of them ravaged and broken by a storm of sometime
               in the recent past), and the day's provisions (some huge catfish and jerked meat from
                  <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>'s fresh kills) than
               we are told about any particular person.</p>
            <p>And so it goes for the remainder of the "<span class="tei_name">Willard</span> Expedition." For the rest of the journey he sporadically appears
               in tantalizing shards of information—the DNA of a fuller story, suggesting (but
               only suggesting) the unique quality of one man's unforgettable experience—and
               through him a better knowledge of the larger organism known as the Corps of
               Discovery. He appears, then just as quickly disappears, leaving us to fill in the
               blanks or connect the dots.<br/> And what dots there are to connect!</p>

               if only he could be brought back to life to tell it in detail from his own point of
               view. Part <em class="hi">Pilgrim's Progress</em>, complete with valuable lessons
               learned on the road, and part <em class="hi">Perils of Pauline</em>, full of close
               calls and comic mishaps, it would also add immeasurable depth to the larger story of
               the Corps of Discovery. If fully fleshed out, <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s tale–of a lowly and sometimes
               hapless private who suffered lashings, injuries, illnesses, and accidents, yet
               persevered to earn his commanders' trust and his nation's thanks–would humanize
               the expedition in a way that the existing accounts never will.</p>
            <p>Lacking that, the mere outline of <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s journey (and of everyone else's brought forth in this book) at
               the very least demands that we resist the temptation to think of "the men" of the
               Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition only in
               passing or predominantly as a single entity. <em class="hi">So far as is possible
                  at this late date</em>, they should be remembered in the way their captains
               thought of them and in the way they knew each other: as distinct and fallible human
               beings. In realizing their individuality, the key to their success–their
               unity–appears even more remarkable. By admitting their fallibility their heroic
               achievement becomes that much more inspiring.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Alexander Willard</span> lived to the
               ripe old age of eighty-seven—long enough to serve his country several times
               more (as a government blacksmith for the Sauk, Fox, Delaware, and Shawnee Indians,
               and in the War of 1812); long enough to marry and raise twelve children (one given
               the name Lewis, another <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>); long
               enough to be alive during the invention of photography and have his picture taken,
               his back proud and erect, his eyes confidently fixed straight ahead; long enough to
               play his part in yet another national transcontinental endeavor, the covered wagon
               migrations to the gold fields of California, where he died in 1865. <a href="#nduncanintro01" id="lnduncanintro01" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>There is a faint suspicion that he did, in fact, keep a journal during his expedition
               with Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the Corps of
               Discovery. Certainly he must have told and retold his adventures to his children and
               grandchildren in the many years that followed. How I wish that journal could be found
               in someone's attic or that one of <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s descendants had transcribed his reminiscences. <a href="#nduncanintro03" id="lnduncanintro03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>But even if such accounts were miraculously discovered, I doubt they would settle a
               question which, in the absence of conclusive facts to the contrary, I've decided to
               believe about <span class="tei_name">Alexander Willard</span>.
               I believe he was asleep during night guard duty back on Camp New Island in 1804 And I
               think I know how <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Ordway</span>
               discovered him and then knew immediately that <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> was both lying down and sleeping. He was
               snoring.</p>

               allowed me to quote from their most valuable publications. All these sources have
               been used to compile the "Personnel Diary" which follows.</p>
            <p>I am happy to acknowledge the great aid given me by Miss Anna M. Cartlidge of
               Baltimore for new data on the <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>-<span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>
               families. To Mrs. Edna McElhiney Olson of St. Charles, Missouri, I am indebted for
               the St. Charles and Millington family data. To Rev. Frederick <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> for the <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> family material and to Mrs. Lois More of Sonoma, California, for
               the lineage of Alexander Hamilton <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>. To them I express my gratitude.</p>
            <p>Many others have sent encouragement and biographical details, but the list is so long
               that I cannot acknowledge them all here. I ask that they accept my sincere
               appreciation for their interest and valuable help.</p>
            <p>I cannot close however, without mention of one more who has been of great assistance.
               Mrs. Dorothy Shields Lollier of Carlsbad, California, has researched the Shields
               family and has brought to my attention most of the information regarding that most
               valuable man to the expedition — John Shields.</p>
            <p>Mr. Anton J. Pregaldin of Clayton, Missouri, has generously supplied me with his
               research on those unsung members of the expedition, the French-Canadian engages. His
               findings, in a most difficult field, throw a helpful glimmer of light on those
               heretofore obscure watermen.</p>
            <p>Last, but far from least, I express deep gratitude to Anna Marie and Everett G. Hager
               for preparing the fine index. I am most fortunate in having all such outstanding
               experts on my team.</p>
            <p>Now I can only hope that my own research and arrangement of all this scattered
               material will be helpful to future students of the Expedition.</p>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>The Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition to the
               Pacific and return by way of the Missouri River in 1804-1806 was probably the best
               written and officially documented of all such governmental undertakings. Certainly
               its captains and several of its members made copious mention in their journals of the
               daily travels and notable sights encountered along the way. We have complete records
               of the material and supplies carried, details of the boats and medicines taken, and
               full reports on the Indians and strange animals and plants discovered. But a complete
               roster of all the men who set out with the expedition was never made. <a href="#nintro01" id="lnintro01" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, they omitted to mention much about themselves in their journals, for
               they were innocently unaware that they were creating history. True, the captains do
               mention a member now and then, but that is about all. They were certainly convinced
               that no biographical data was necessary, for this was a military command.</p>
            <p>After the expedition successfully returned in 1806, there was a long delay before the
               publication of their journals in 1814. <a href="#nintro02" id="lnintro02" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The War of 1812
               occupied the nation's attention, and for a long lapse of years the members of the
               expedition were forgotten.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study is an attempt to bring these men into being again and to
               rescue them from oblivion so far as is possible at this late date. Therefore, it is
               not the purpose here to discuss the reasons that brought the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition into being. However, I
               think it pertinent to recall that an investigation of what lay beyond the Mississippi
               had for many years been in <span class="tei_name">Thomas
                  Jefferson</span>'s mind.</p>
            <p>At least two of his previous plans to cross the continent — that of <span class="tei_name">John Ledyard</span> and Andrew Michaux —
               had come to naught. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> knew
               of the recently published account of <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span>'s journal which contained a detailed plan of how Great
               Britain might set up posts at the mouth of the Columbia River, and at other suitable
               ports. These were to control the ever increasing numbers of American ships that were
               then dominating the sea-otter trade to the Orient. These plans also included control
               of the fur trade and fisheries of that part of Western America.</p>
            <p>These international schemes were plain to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, and they had to be averted before they became permanently
               established. The United States had a claim to the Oregon country because <span class="tei_name">Captain Robert Gray</span> was the first to
               discover and enter the mouth of the Columbia River in 1792. This claim could be
               strengthened by an overland expedition to, and exploration of, the lands bordering
               the upper waters of the Columbia — and by descending that river to the sea.</p>
            <p>In the winter of 1802, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>
               instructed his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, who was skilled at frontier
               living and who had recently served in several campaigns with the army, to study
               botany, zoology, medicine, and celestial navigation in preparation for leading an
               expedition to the Pacific.</p>
            <p>In a secret appeal to Congress on January 18, 1803, the sum of "Twenty-five Hundred
               Dollars" was appropriated for "An intelligent officer with ten or twelve chosen men,
               fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it, taken from our military posts,
               where they may be spared without inconvenience, might explore the whole line, even to
               the Western Ocean." To further cinch the argument, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> mentioned that "The soldiers pay would be
               going on, whether here or there" and that "the appropriation of Twenty-five Hundred
               Dollars for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States
               — would cover the undertaking." <a href="#nintro03" id="lnintro03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> In the light of
               recent study, it appears that Congress was privy to an understanding, not openly
               admitted, of the "official" request for appropriations. In early 1803, the jealousies
               of England, France, and Spain were not to be aroused by a large military party
               snooping around in disputed domains. Furthermore, the influential fur trading
               companies did not look with favor on this constant probing into their lands. The
               inevitable settlement which followed was contrary to the source of their income.</p>
            <p>But before the year 1803 was finished, it became evident that such a small party as
               ten or twelve men could never overcome the Indians who zealously contested the
               passage to the upper Missouri River. The British traders already in that country did
               not desire competition from traders coming up the Missouri from the south, and they
               did all in their power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1803, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>
               was firmly convinced by Auguste Chouteau, <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> and other experienced traders, who had for many years been
               familiar with the lower Missouri — that a stronger, and hence, larger party,
               would be necessary to command respect, and safe traverse of the Missouri waters.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> kept <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> advised of these
               developments, and the latter adroitly managed the additional funds required.
               Historians may never learn how this was done, but the fact remains that it was. To
               help matters, he had as we say today, "something special going for him" in 1803.
               Louisiana, which in those days was about all the lands west of the Mississippi to the
               western mountains (wherever they were), changed hands from Spain to France to the
               United States in that year. That transaction removed some of the sticky diplomatic
               difficulties, although Spain remained convinced that the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> party really intended to take over
               the Spanish establishments. Spain actually sent out from Santa Fe in 1804 an overland
               expedition to cut Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                  off. <a href="#nintro04" id="lnintro04" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Fortunately it could not find them.</p>
            <p>During the summer and fall of 1803, Lewis and his coleader, <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, were recruiting and testing men as
               possible prospects for the rigorous adventures that lay ahead. While the men were
               selected with great care, <span class="tei_name">Captain
                  Lewis</span> was authorized to offer the following inducements to those enlisting:
                   <a href="#nintro05" id="lnintro05" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <blockquote><p>
               <p>FIRST: The bounty (if not a soldier) but in both cases, six months pay in advance.
                  Pay of $10.00 per month, plus clothing and subsistence</p>
               <p>SECOND: To discharge them from service if they wish it, immediately on their
                  return from the expedition, giving them their arrears of pay, clothing, etc.</p>
               <p>THIRD : To secure to them a portion of land equal to that given by the United
                  States to the officers and soldiers who served in the Revolutionary War.</p>
            </p></blockquote>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> was authorized to
               select by voluntary engagement, men from the companies of Captains Russell and <span class="tei_name">Daniel Bissell</span>, and of <span class="tei_name">Captain Amos Stoddard</span> now occupying the
               posts of Fort Massac and Fort Kaskaskia. <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> was also authorized to engage any other men, not soldiers,
               whom he thought useful in promoting the objects or success of the expedition. They
               were to recruit "some good hunters; stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the
               woods, and capable of bearing bodily fatigues to a considerable degree. The hunters
               were to be engaged with the understanding that they were to bear the common labor of
               the party and not to engage in hunting exclusively."</p>
            <p>With <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>'s agreement to
               join <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> in the
               expedition, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was furnished with
               these instructions, and Lewis advised him to be on the lookout for suitable men.
               Several young gentlemen's sons applied to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, but as he felt they were not accustomed to labor, he had to
               diplomatically offer them no encouragement. He did temporarily engage some men who
               later became known as "The nine young men from Kentucky."</p>
            <p>Major William MacRae, Commandant at South West Point, Kentucky, was instructed to
               send six or eight soldiers as likely candidates from Tennessee to Fort Massac to
               await <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>'s arrival.</p>
            <p>With this help and inducements, <span class="tei_name">Captain
                  Lewis</span> wrote <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on
               September 28, 1803, that he felt "we shall be able to form our party without much
               difficulty; four or five French water-men I conceive will be essential, this we can
               do I presume very readily at St. Louis." In the same letter Lewis wrote, "I have two
               young men with me whom I have taken on trial and not yet engaged them, but
               conditionally only, though I think they will answer tolerably well."  <a href="#nintro06" id="lnintro06" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> came down
               the Ohio River and was joined by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> at Louisville, some twelve temporary recruits also came along. At
               Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; in Kentucky, and at the frontier military posts of Fort
               Massac, Vincennes and Kaskaskia, other volunteers were recruited and transferred to
               Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s command.</p>
            <p>They formed a camp at Wood River (Camp du Bois) in Illinois, which in 1803 was about
               opposite the mouth of the Missouri River. <a href="#nintro07" id="lnintro07" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> This location
               was not too far from St. Louis, but sufficiently removed from its wine shops and
               women, and, most importantly, was <em class="hi">not</em> in Spanish territory.
               Here during the winter and spring, <span class="tei_name">Captain
                  Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Ordway</span>
               observed and drilled the men who had been chosen thus far. All of them had been
               selected for their special talents and experiences as backwoods men. All were of a
               resourceful nature, and a few, such as one Mr. Leakins, who were overly resourceful,
               were rejected as being too undisciplined to serve under a military command.</p>
            <p>During the cold winter the men built huts, hunted deer, rabbits, racoons and turkeys
               for their sustenance. They had to build a sled in order to haul in enough firewood.
               Compatibility was established, and a pattern of camp life was begun which would
               prevail over the next two years.</p>
            <p>Whiskey peddlers soon found the camp, which caused some trouble. Discipline had to be
               enforced. Court-martial rules were set up for dealing with the red-blooded, rugged
               recruits who were frequently drunk. It is worthy of note that some of the men who
               later turned out to be the most valuable men of the party, were among those who had
               to be punished while at Camp Woods, as the following orders will show:</p>

               </span>
               <p>The Commanding officer feels himself mortified and disappointed at the disorderly
                  conduct of <span class="tei_name">Reubin Fields</span> in
                  refusing to mount guard when in the due roteen of duty he was regularly warned;
                  nor is he less surprised at the want of discretion in those who urged his
                  opposition to the faithful discharge of his duty, particularly (John) Shields,
                  whose sense of propryety he had every reason to believe would have induced him
                  rather to have promoted good order, than to have excited disorder and faction
                  among the party, particularly in the absence of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and himself.</p>
               <p>The Commanding officer is also sorry to find any man, who has been engaged by
                  himself and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> for the
                  expedition on which they have entered, so destitute of understanding, as not to be
                  able to draw the distinction between being placed under the command of another
                  officer, whose will in such case would be their law, and that of obeying the
                  orders of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and himself
                  communicated to them through <span class="tei_name">Sergt.
                     Ordway</span>, who, as one of the party, has during their necessary absence
                  been charged with the execution of their orders; acting from those orders
                  expressly, and not from his own caprice, and who, is in all respects accountable
                  to us for the faithful observance of the same.</p>
               <p>A moments reflection must convince every man of our party, that were we to neglect
                  the more important and necessary arrangements in relation to the voyage we are now
                  entering on, for the purpose merely of remaining at camp in order to communicate
                  our orders in person to the individuals of the party on mere points of policy,
                  they would have too much reason to complain; nay, even to fear the ultimate
                  success of the enterprise in which we are all embarked. The abuse of some of the
                  party in respect with privilege heretofore granted them of going into the country,
                  is not less displeasing; to such therefore as have made hunting or other business
                  a pretext to cover their design of visiting a neighboring Whiskey shop, he cannot
                  for the present extend this privilege; and does therefore most positively direct
                  that <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, <span class="tei_name">Bolye</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wiser</span> and <span class="tei_name">Robinson</span> do
                  not receive permission to leave camp under any pretext whatever for <em class="hi">ten days</em>, after this order is read on the parade, unless
                  otherwise directed hereafter by <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span> or himself. The Commanding officers highly approve of the conduct
                  of <span class="tei_name">Sergt. Ordway</span>. The Carpenters,
                  Blacksmiths, and in short the whole party (except <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>, who has been specially directed to perform
                  other duties) are to obey implicity the orders of <span class="tei_name">Sergt. Ordway</span>, who has received our instructions and
                  is held accountable to us for their due execution.</p>

               <p>This order obviously produced the desired effect, for we find all the men
                  mentioned to be members of the party when it started out, and <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span>, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s, John <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Peter Weiser</span> became members of the permanent party that went on to the
                  Pacific.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>, as he was always
                  recognized by the party, though when his commission arrived was only as a second
                  lieutenant in the Artillery, spent most of the time at Camp Woods. He pondered the
                  provisions needed for the expedition, the loading of the three boats, and gave
                  considerable attention to those men who would be selected as permanent members who
                  were to cross the continent, and to those which would comprise the extra force
                  needed to get the equipment and provisions beyond the Indians who dominated the
                  lower Missouri. Try as he would, the total number always came out to be around
                  fifty men. In one of his notes he lists "Our party: 2 Captains; 4 Sergeants; 3
                  interpreters; 22 Americans; 9 or 10 Frenchmen, and <span class="tei_name">York</span>, his slave. Plus 1 Corporal and 6 soldiers in a canoe with
                  provisions for the party as far as these provisions last." <a href="#nintro09" id="lnintro09" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> This totals 48 men if there were nine Frenchmen, or 49 if there were
                  ten.</p>
               <p>This is a point to remember when later the journalists all state the total number
                  of the party consisted of only fortyfive men.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> had been
                  engaged to act as interpreter for the party. He was dispatched to Tennessee to
                  recruit men, and he returned on December 16, 1803, with eight men. One was a
                  blacksmith and another was a "Housejoiner." <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> wrote to <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> in St. Louis "that he did not know
                  how they will answer our experiment, but I am a little disappointed in finding
                  them not possessed of more of the requisite qualifications. There is not a hunter
                  among them. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> nor
                  myself have made no particular bargain with them. I have offered <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> $25.00 per month for
                  as long as he may choose to continue with us."</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> spent most of the
                  time in St. Louis, procuring maps and every bit of information he could gather
                  regarding the land and natives resident up river. Additional medicines and
                  provisions for the voyage were obtained. He was advised that the best men for
                  propelling the boats were those French-Canadian water-men who lived at Kaskaskia
                  and Cahokia. These were villages on the Illinois side of the Mississippi near St.
                  Louis where these boatmen resided when not off on some trading adventure up the
                  Missouri or Mississippi rivers. With Mr. Chouteau's help, the most capable and
                  reliable men were engaged to man the boats as far as the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Nation. Lewis wrote
                     <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that "Mr. Chouteau has
                  procured seven engages to go as far as the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> but they will not agree to go further, and
                  I found it impossible to reduce them to any other engagement than that usually
                  made with these people."  <a href="#nintro10" id="lnintro10" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Probably meaning that
                  they would not enlist in a military organization.</p>
               <p>Some of these engages may have been former employees of the North West Company of
                  Canada. John McDonnell, about the year 1795, wrote an account found in Masson's
                     <em class="hi">Les Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest</em> (vol. I, p.
                  272) : "Many of the Company's servants (have been) deserting from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> country with an
                  intention of going to the Illinois and other places on the Mississippi. . ." It is
                  possible that "La Liberte" (Jo Barter), <span class="tei_name">Joseph Collin</span> and Jean Baptiste DeChamps were former members of the
                  North West Company. Likewise, Francois Rivet, <span class="tei_name">Paul Primeau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Peter Roi</span> and others could have originated from that source, for the
                  same, or variants of the name, appear in the rosters of the North West Company for
                  the years just prior to the formation of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition. See for example, above citation,
                  pages 396–411.</p>
               <p>John Francis McDermott  <a href="#nintro11" id="lnintro11" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> reprints an apt description
                  of the engage:</p>
               <blockquote><p>
                  <p>These men carried out the necessary work of the trade; cordelling, poling or
                     rowing up the Missouri to operational headquarters, seeking out and trading
                     with the Indian villages; trapping the beaver and other fur-bearers; hunting
                     meat animals; maintaining the equipment, conveying the messages through the
                     unknown country; cooking; keeping camp; tending horses; and performing a score
                     of other regular and extra duties. Some of them were sons and grandsons of the
                     men who had come up the Mississippi River from New Orleans with Laclede and
                     Auguste Chouteau, and of this group some were native St. Lousians and many more
                     came from the settlements such as Fort Chartres, Kaskaskia, Cahokia and St.
                     Genevieve.</p>
               </p></blockquote>
               <p>The number of men now deemed necessary was a considerable advance over that
                  understood by Congress. In view of this situation, there could possibly have been
                  an understanding with <span class="tei_name">President
                     Jefferson</span> that the "official" figure would be acceptable if the total
                  number did not exceed forty-five, including the two captains. This could be one of
                  the reasons that no complete roster was compiled by the captains at the outset of
                  the expedition.</p>
               <p>At any rate, all those who kept journals — Lewis, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> — dutifully record that the
                  total number was about forty-five men. They do not all agree on the number, but
                  none exceeds forty-five.</p>
               <p>So for over a hundred and fifty years this number has been accepted. As the names
                  of the entire roster had never been published, no one seemed to question it. Of
                  course, the names of the thirty men who had gone on to the Pacific were known and
                  recorded in the journals, but what of those twenty or so who had helped the party
                  up to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages,
                  had wintered there, and had returned to St. Louis in the early summer of 1805?
                  They brought back the maps and reports that had been made thus far, as well as
                  many crates of new animal, mineral and botanical specimens. They saw to it that
                  all this material was dispatched to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> in Washington, and several of them conducted those Indians
                  who had been prevailed upon to visit the Great White Father, and had acted as
                  interpreters between them and <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span>. All this was part and plan of the expedition from
                  its original conception.</p>
               <p>To many students of the expedition, these men <em class="hi">were</em>
                  important to the success of the enterprise. It has since been felt that more
                  should be known of the entire party— just who they were — and as much
                  biographical information should be collected as is possible.</p>
               <p>As the journals were studied, it also became evident that more men returned from
                  the expedition than the forty-five that were stated to have gone at its start.</p>
               <p>In the December 1944, issue of the <em class="hi">Oregon Historical
                     Quarterly</em>, <a href="#nintro12" id="lnintro12" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> I submitted a roster and made
                  the suggestion that the number should be forty-seven including the captains. I
                  presented a list of forty-five, plus additional names that merited consideration.
                  At that time I felt it presumptuous for a mere student to fly into the face of the
                  scholars and historians who had edited the journals. Since 1944, much new material
                  has been published which substantiates, and even elaborates on that thinking.</p>
               <p>In 1964, <em class="hi">The Field Notes of <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>
                  </em>, 1803–1804, edited by
                  Ernest S. Osgood, were published by the Yale University Press. <em class="hi">The Letters of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition, with Related Documents</em> 1783–1854,
                  edited by Donald Jackson, were published in 1962 by the University of Illinois
                  Press. Each adds bits of additional information regarding the personnel. It now
                  appears that <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> was
                  right when he noted a party of about fifty men.</p>
               <p>But even if we accept this new figure, we are still far from an easy solution as
                  to the names of the men, for the captains, especially <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, had a charming disregard for the accuracy of
                  spelling. When it came to proper names, almost any combination of letters seemed
                  to suffice. Take the name of <span class="tei_name">Corporal Richard Warfington</span> for example. We find it rendered <em class="hi">Warfington, <span class="tei_name">Worthington</span>, <span class="tei_name">Worbington</span>, <span class="tei_name">Worthyton</span>
                  </em> and even more exotic variations. <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> was nearly always <em class="hi">
                     <span class="tei_name">Drewyer</span>
                  </em>.
                  But those are the easy ones. In another case we have <em class="hi">
                     <span class="tei_name">Carr</span>n, <span class="tei_name">Carr</span>, <span class="tei_name">
                        <span class="tei_name">Cane</span>
                     </span> or Cann</em>, all
                  apparently meant to represent one person. I need not here show what happened to
                  the spelling of the French names. That will be found in the roster.</p>
               <p>As though this were not problem enough, we also have those who, following the
                  success of the expedition, attempted to climb on the band-wagon and publicly claim
                  that they had been members of the party. There are many examples, of which it is
                  sufficient to cite only one:</p>
               <blockquote><p>
                  <p>Benjamin Jones was a noted hunter, trapper and surveyor of early times in
                     Missouri. His father was an Englishman who settled in Virginia at an early
                     date. He had two sons, Lewis and Benjamin. The latter ran away from home when
                     he was sixteen years of age, and came to St. Louis, where he joined the Indians
                     and engaged in trapping, until Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> started on their expedition, when he
                     joined their party in the capacity of a scout. Before the expedition reached
                     the Pacific Ocean, he and one or two others were sent back to St. Louis with
                     dispatches. They fell into an Indian ambuscade, lost their horses, and had to
                     perform the journey on foot, which occupied six months but they arrived safely
                     and delivered the dispatches. <a href="#nintro13" id="lnintro13" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
                  </p>
               </p></blockquote>
               <p>Now the first part of this notice could be true, for this Benjamin Jones <em class="hi">was</em> on the Missouri in 1809–1810, and was a hunter
                  with the government service on the Santa Fe trail in 1825. But we find no other
                  documented mention of where Jones was ever a member of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition.</p>
               <p>The student can only sift these momentarily exciting bits of data, and present
                  those which seem to contain honest paydirt. My roster which follows, has been
                  compiled from the researchers who were on the scene some sixty-five years ago,
                  such as Reuben G. Thwaites, <span class="tei_name">Elliott
                     Coues</span>, Eva Emery Dye, <a href="#nintro14" id="lnintro14" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Olin D.
                     Wheeler, <a href="#nintro15" id="lnintro15" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> James K. Hosmer  <a href="#nintro16" id="lnintro16" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and others. They all gave an account of the men, as far as they knew
                  at the time. In addition we have the works of Bradbury, <a href="#nintro17" id="lnintro17" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Brackenridge, <a href="#nintro18" id="lnintro18" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Henry, <a href="#nintro19" id="lnintro19" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> and others who lived in, and wrote of the days when
                  some of these men were still living. Army records and considerable genealogical
                  research have also added details for a more complete picture. I have used them all
                  as sources in compiling my roster.</p>
               <p>Probably not all historians and researchers will ever agree on exactly which men
                  actually started out with Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. A few of the French engages seem to have disappeared from the
                  records, so further data on them is completely lacking. Just when a solution seems
                  to be reached, a new name will crop up. For example, we find a new one in <em class="hi">The Field Notes of <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>
                  </em> previously mentioned. On page 244 of that work we
                  find in a tentative list of engages, a very legible "<span class="tei_name">E. Cann</span>" written in someone's hand. It is interesting to
                  note in the same reproduction of the original document that two of the engages'
                  names are joined together in one: William Labiece Mallat. These are surely William
                     <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> and Etienne
                  Malboeuf. On page 278 Cann is written out in what appears to my perhaps prejudiced
                  eye as "<span class="tei_name">Carn</span>," though on page 118 Dr.
                  Osgood deciphers the word as "Cane." In all my many years of study and research
                  "Cann" and "Cane" are new names to me. To my knowledge none of the journals, nor
                  the vast literature of the fur trade which followed the expedition, even suggests
                  this name.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, one of the spellings in the original journals under date of
                  August 13, 1804, is <em class="hi">
                     <span class="tei_name">Carr</span>n</em>. In the <em class="hi">Field Notes</em>, page 48,
                  there is the word <em class="hi">Carseux</em> written over an entry. This is
                  not singular, for on the entry for July 5, 1804, we find the name of Howard
                  — one of the members — written over it. In The <em class="hi">Territorial Papers of the United States</em>, <a href="#nintro20" id="lnintro20" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
                  under date of December 28, 1805, we find that <span class="tei_name">Alexander Carson</span>, along with <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                     Robidoux</span>, Pierre Chouteau, John Carson, <span class="tei_name">John Robertson</span> and hundreds of others, were
                  signers of a memorial attesting to the good conduct of Governor Wilkinson. John
                  Bradbury  <a href="#nintro21" id="lnintro21" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> states that <span class="tei_name">Alexander Carson</span> was near the head of the Missouri in

               <h4>[James W. Nesmith, Indian Commissioner]</h4>
               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
               <p> . . .You desire to know the particulars of the murder of <span class="tei_name">Alexander Carson</span>, a Virginian (I think) who was murdered
                  in April, or May, 1836, at a place called Ellick's [Alec's] Butte, about six miles
                  north of Lafayette, Yam Hill County, by an Indian, who was called Boney, of the
                  Nefalitin Tribe.</p>
               <p>This Boney had been in Carson's employ for several years, trapping, and had always
                  been treated with the utmost kindness and regard, by Carson, he had great
                  confidence in the Indian.</p>
               <p>Whatever led to the crime, is more than anyone knows. Carson had been stopping at
                  my house two or three weeks, this Boney, his wife, and son with him. Carson was
                  sick. When he thought he was able to travel, left my house accompanied by Boney,
                  Boney's wife and son. The first night after leaving my house (he) camped at
                  Ellick's Butte, the whole tribe camped there. Boney arose in the night, stole out
                  of Carson's tent his (Carson's) rifle, which he held in reserve and holding up the
                  curtain of the tent so that the light of the fire might shine on Carson, compelled
                  his son (a lad of twelve or fourteen years) to shoot him in the head with a
                  shot-gun, blowing his brains all over the tent.</p>
               <p>The body was thrown in a small stream, and the plunder distributed out amongst the
                  tribe. I may mention here an Indian by the name of Click-kowin who was said to be
                  a half Killamook, and was with the Killamooks a portion of his time, was accessory
                  to the murder, and shared in the plunder.</p>
               <p>Boney, and his son, died soon after the murder was committed, and Click-kowin was
                  shot after the murder, by Waaninkapah, the Chief of the Nefalitin tribe.</p>
               <p>Those Indians have never atoned for the crime, they were compelled to give up a
                  portion of the plunder which was delivered over to William Cannin, a cousin of
                  Carsons. Boney's son confessed the crime and went with us and showed where all the
                  plunder had been cached, as far as he knew of.</p>
               <p>Carson came out to the Mountains with Lewis &amp; <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and after returning to the States, engaged
                  with Hunt in 1811 and returned to this country, and remained here.</p>

               <p>I quote this letter in full, except for some irrelevant matter at the opening,
                  because <span class="tei_name">Alexander Carson</span>, along with
                  Joseph <span class="tei_name">Collins</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charles Hebert</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charles Caugee</span> and "<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>," have no official record of any wages paid for
                  service. Heretofore, historians have questioned that they were members of the
                  expedition.</p>
               <p>As I have shown above, Lewis was authorized to hire, rather than enlist, extra
                  men, which he apparently did and paid some of them off at Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> in the spring of 1805.
                  Note the entry under date of August 22, 1806, where we read:</p>
               <blockquote><p>
                  <p>At this nation we found <span class="tei_name">Rokey</span> who
                     was one of our engagés as high as the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. This man had spent all his wages and
                     requested to return with us. We agreed to give him passage down [to St. Louis].
                         <a href="#nintro23" id="lnintro23" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
                  </p>
               </p></blockquote>
               <p>This would seem to be proof that a few of the men were not enlisted, but were
                  hired for the trip up the Missouri only, and were paid wages out of funds in hand.
                  The others were paid by <span class="tei_name">Captain Amos
                     Stoddard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                  Lewis</span>'s agent in St. Louis. For this reason they do not appear on the
                  muster rolls and were not entitled to extra pay and land warrants as the enlisted
                  men later were. This may also be a reason why the journalists list only forty-five
                  men, for they might not have considered the hired, extra men as technically a part
                  of the expedition.</p>
               <p> In the revised <em class="hi">
                     <span class="tei_name">Private Joseph Whitehouse</span> Journal</em>, as yet unpublished, there is
                  found a partial list of the members who set out and adds "8 Canadians who were
                  only to proceed with us to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>."</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Alexander Carson</span> could have been one of
                  these extra men, for with the evidence I have shown, and the entry in the journals
                  for August 18, 1804, <a href="#nintro24" id="lnintro24" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> where it is stated: "Detached
                  Sgt. Oderway, <span class="tei_name">Peter Crusatt</span>,
                     <span class="tei_name">George Shannon</span>, <span class="tei_name">Werner</span> and <em class="hi">
                     <span class="tei_name">Carr</span>n</em> to the <span class="tei_name">Mahar</span> Village with a flag. . ."
                  [italics mine], we know that such a man <em class="hi">was</em> with the
                  expedition. Thwaites appears to have had some evidence, for on page 109 he notes
                  after the word <span class="tei_name">Carr</span>n "(Carson–
                  editor)."</p>
               <p>The above evidence, while not conclusive, is the best we have at present. However,
                  I believe it is strong enough that <span class="tei_name">Alexander
                     Carson</span> should be considered as one of the party until such time as we
                  have positive contrary evidence.</p>
               <p>In connection with these "alleged members," it may be of interest to report a
                  sidelight that is of record. As shown, the previously mentioned <span class="tei_name">Alexander Carson</span>, in his last years, was
                  living in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. A companion of his trapping days,
                  William Canning, was living on a farm nearby. William Canning was a bona fide
                  mountain man, and had been with Wilson P. Hunt's Astorian party of 1810. <a href="#nintro25" id="lnintro25" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a> When Charles Wilkes, U.S.N., wrote of his Oregon
                  explorations of 1841  <a href="#nintro26" id="lnintro26" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> he stated:</p>
               <blockquote><p>
                  <p>At Champoeg, Willamette Valley, was an old man by the name of Cannon [there
                     goes that spelling again — author] who had been one of the party with
                     Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and from his
                     own account, the only remaining one in the country. . .</p>
               </p></blockquote>
               <p>Now Canning should have been aware that Francois Rivet, who was a member of the
                  party as far as the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>, was living on a farm nearby. We can forgive him that he may not
                  have known that <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span> was
                  living in West Virginia at the time. But he may just be bragging about himself.
                  Mountain men had a bad habit of doing that.</p>
               <p>Wilkes of course did not mention the fact that Alexander Carson had, in 1829, made
                  a will in favor of Canning, and that after Carson had been murdered in 1836,
                  Canning had claimed from the Hudson's Bay Company, the balance of accounts that
                  were due Carson. <a href="#nintro27" id="lnintro27" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> It appears that in his relation to
                  Wilkes, Canning was also trying to claim Carson's role as a Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> member.</p>
               <p>There is ample documentary evidence to show that Carson and Canning were two
                  different men. It is tempting to speculate that <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> could have been referring to Canning
                  when he rendered the name as Cann and Cane. But it is difficult to imagine that
                  the clearly legible E. of E. Cann could be taken to mean an initial for William.
                  "G" for the French spelling of William perhaps, but hardly an "E". We have already
                  seen that Ellick is one of the spellings, along with Alec., as a nickname for
                  Alexander.</p>
               <p>In any event, neither Canning, Cannin, nor Cannon is ever mentioned in conection

               <p>I have given all this Carson material as a typical example of the research done to
                  arrive at the most complete and correct roster possible. In an attempt to gather
                  further information, I appended additional data to my 1944 roster, and it was
                  published in the DAR Magazine for November, 1965. <a href="#nintro28" id="lnintro28" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
                  The idea for submitting the story to that magazine was to solicit the aid of the
                  members of the DAR who may be descended from some of these men, and who would
                  furnish genealogical information. I am happy to acknowledge that quite a bit of
                  new information has been acquired, and is collected here for the first time. In no
                  case have I used "family tradition," but only include data that is fully
                  documented. I am particularly pleased that some of the members who heretofore have
                  had the notation after their names — "Nothing more known of him" —
                  have been rescued from oblivion.</p>
               <p>By the time the winter of 1803 had passed into the spring of 1804, <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> had decided on which of
                  the men would be taken along on the expedition. Many of them had been transferred
                  from their former military units as of January 1, 1804, onto the muster rolls of
                  the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition.
                  Later, some of the French water-men had been enlisted, but others were hired as
                  extra hands. The provisions and Indian trade goods were divided so that some of
                  each were placed in separate boxes in order that all would not be lost in case of
                  accident. The air gun was mounted on the keel-boat and the arms checked and put in
                  order. The powder was contained in cannisters of lead which could later be melted
                  and molded into bullets when the cannisters were empty. A hundred other details
                  had to be thought out and arranged, for once the expedition set out, no other
                  supplies could be obtained in the frontier country into which they were going.</p>
               <p>At long last, spring arrived, and the Missouri was showing signs of becoming
                  navigable. <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> was in
                  St. Louis winding up the many last minute details, including a conference with a
                  delegation of <span class="tei_name">Osage Indians</span>.
                  George <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was with him
                  most of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>, at Camp Woods (Camp
                  du Bois) :</p>
               <blockquote><p>
                  <p> . . determined to go as far as St. Charles, a french Village 7 Leags. up the
                     Missourie, and wait at that place untill <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> could finish the business in
                     which he was obliged to attend to at St. Louis and join me by Land from that
                     place 24 miles; by this movement I calculated that if any alterations in the
                     loading of the Vestles or other Changes necessary, that they might be made at
                     St. Charles.  <a href="#nintro29" id="lnintro29" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>

               <p>So at 4 o'clock on the afternoon of May 14, 1804, the shake-down cruise began.
                  They easily could have made St. Charles in one day, but <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> took all of two, for there was no
                  hurry, and much had to be learned about the men, the boats, and the loading. They
                  soon found out that the keel-boat was too heavily loaded in the stern. On the
                  nights of the 14th and 15th, they camped along the river, for this presented an
                  opportunity to test the arrangement of the men into messes, or groups, where each
                  prepared its own meals. This pre-arrangement was continued until May 26th of the
                  voyage when a few changes were made. On the 16th of May, the party arrived at St.
                  Charles, where, during the following four days, the cargoes were reloaded. On the
                  19th, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> came over
                  from St. Louis with $99.00 which was apparently used to purchase supplies which
                     <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> thought necessary. <a href="#nintro30" id="lnintro30" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> had warned the
                  members :</p>
               <blockquote><p>
                  <p>That they should act with true respect for their own dignity, and not make it
                     necessary for him to leave the comforts of the town for a more retired
                     situation  <a href="#nintro31" id="lnintro31" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
                  </p>
               </p></blockquote>
               <p>Nevertheless, <span class="tei_name">William Werner</span>,
                     <span class="tei_name">Hugh Hall</span> and John <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> went absent-without-leave, and
                  furthermore, <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> behaved in an
                  unbecoming manner at the ball, and after his return to the keel-boat, had uttered
                  disrespectful statements in regard to the orders of <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had been over to Portage des <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> to talk and trade with
                  the Indians at that place, and the three men had taken advantage of his absence.
                  This sort of behavior had to be stopped, so Captain <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> appointed a court-martial, headed by Sgt.
                  John <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, with <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s, <span class="tei_name">Richard Windsor</span>, Joseph <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> and <span class="tei_name">John Potts</span> as members. The court sentenced each of the
                  culprits to receive twenty-five lashes on their bare-backs, but because of the
                  former good conduct of <span class="tei_name">Werner</span> and
                  Hall, they recommended mercy from Captain <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The punishment was remitted for them, but John <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> received his punishment at
                  sunset that evening.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, May 20th, the men were given leave to enjoy themselves and to hear a
                  sermon at the Catholic Church on Main Street. That afternoon at six-thirty, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> arrived from St.
                  Louis with a group of friends to help send the expedition off. He was accompanied
                  by Capt. Amos <span class="tei_name">Stoddard</span> (who was to
                  act as his agent while he was away), Lt. <span class="tei_name">Clarence Mulford</span>, Lt. Stephen Worrall and the
                  Messrs. Auguste Chouteau, <span class="tei_name">Charles
                     Gratiot</span>, <span class="tei_name">David

                     Rankin</span> and Doctor Antoine Francois Saugrain. <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> made some additional purchases
                  such as sugar, and castor-oil was obtained from Doctors Jeremiah and Seth
                  Millington. These were two American doctors who had arrived in St. Charles in
                  January 1799 and were now raising medicinal plants on their farms located above
                  the town.  <a href="#nintro32" id="lnintro32" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>The gentlemen of the village gave a banquet and a ball for the party. It was the
                  last taste of civilization before their departure. The next day, May 21, 1804, the
                  orders were given for departure, and despite the rain, a farewell parade was
                  given. The band played all the way down the mile long main street fronting the
                  Missouri River, and there was singing and fiddle playing.33 <a href="#nintro33" id="lnintro33" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> By four o'clock all the men were aboard who were to sail at the
                  time, and the expedition left St. Charles under a salute and three cheers from the
                  dignitaries and citizens. In honor of their warm hospitality, three cheers were
                  returned and three guns were fired from the boats as a salute. Under the joint
                  command of Captains Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the expedition officially started up the Missouri.</p>
               <p>Since that fateful day some one hundred and sixty years ago when the expedition
                  faded off into the dim distance, the following facts have been gathered about the
                  men who comprised it, and who set off on this historic voyage of exploration.</p>

                     of William and Lucy (Meriwether) Lewis. Well educated, blond– sunny hair;
                     bowlegged, particular, precise, serious, reserved and inclined to melancholia
                     and hypochondria. He served in the 1st Infantry, U.S. Army and in Gen. Wayne's
                     northwestern campaigns. In 1801 he was appointed Pres. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s private secretary. After the
                     expedition, he was appointed the Governor of Louisiana Territory. Clerks in
                     Washington protested some of his drafts — some of which were connected
                     with the expedition — which caused him emotional strain. He decided to go
                     to Washington to explain the drafts, and while enroute on the Natchez Trace, he
                     died, either by murder or suicide, on October 11, 1809. A monument stands at

                     short, burley, barrel-chested. "His talk unconventional — better suited
                     for the camp than the parlor." He was recruited from Capt. <span class="tei_name">Russell Bissell</span>'s 1st Infantry at Kaskaskia,
                     and his pay started with Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as of January 1, 1804. He had enlisted in the loth U.S.
                     Infantry in 1799 at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, after having served in a Ranger
                     Company in 1792. He was a fine carpenter, boat builder, woodsman and great wit.
                     After <span class="tei_name">Charles Floyd</span>'s death, he
                     was elected sergeant. After the expedition, he served in the War of 1812 under
                     Capt. Kingsly of Nashville, Tennessee. In March 1813, he was at Fort Massac,
                     Kentucky, then at Bellefontaine, Missouri. In 1814, he ascended the Ohio to
                     Pittsburgh, then on to Fort Erie. He was in the battle of Lundy's Lane; then to
                     Sackett's Harbor. He lost his left eye at Fort Independence in June 1815, and
                     was discharged and pensioned in the same month for total disability. He married
                     at the age of sixty, in 1831, to Maria Hamilton, aged twenty. They were the
                     parents of six children: Benjamin, William, James, Sarah, Annie and Rachel.</p>
                  <p>He died April 2, 1870, aged almost ninety-nine years — the sole survivor
                     of the expedition. He is buried at Brooke County Cemetery, at Wellsburg, West
                     Virginia. He was the first to publish a journal of the expedition in 1807,
                     seven years before the official Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> journals were finally printed in 1814.

                  <p>Born about 1775 at Dumbarton, New Hampshire. His parents and a brother,
                     Stephen, lived near Hebron, New Hampshire, in the spring of 1804. He was
                     recruited from Capt. Bissell's 1st Infantry Company at Kaskaskia and went on
                     Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s payroll as of
                     January 1, 1804, though he was in charge of Camp du Bois much of the time
                     before this date. He was educated and kept a journal which, after being lost
                     for over a hundred years, was published in 1916. He was held in high esteem by
                     his commanders. He kept the orderly books and held other important duties while
                     on the expedition.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition returned in 'Sob, he witnessed the sale on September 29,
                     1806, of <span class="tei_name">John Collins</span> and Joseph
                        <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>'s land
                     warrants. He purchased the land warrants of his fellow members, <span class="tei_name">William Werner</span> and Jean Baptiste
                        <span class="tei_name">La Page</span>. He went to
                     Washington with Captain Lewis and a party of Indians to show to the President,
                     then he returned to New Hampshire for a time. In 1809 he returned to Missouri
                     and settled in the Tywappity Bottom, near New Madrid, Missouri. He became an
                     owner of extensive lands and attained some prosperity — having two
                     plantations of peach and apple orchards. He married in Missouri, and he and his
                     wife, Gracy, died in Missouri about 1817. They left no survivors. <a href="#nbioroster07" id="lnbioroster07" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

                  <strong>7. S<span class="smallcaps">ERGEANT</span> NATHANIEL HALE PRYOR.</strong>
                  <p>Born in 1772, probably in Amherst County, Virginia. He was a son of John and
                     Nancy (<span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>) <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>. She was a sister of
                     Robert <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>, and Robert was
                     the father of Charles <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>
                     — also a member of the expedition. Therefore, <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span> were cousins. He moved with his parents in
                     1783 to Kentucky, and was recruited by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> on October 20, 1803. He is usually listed as one of
                     the "Nine young men from Kentucky." He married on May 17, 1798, Miss Peggy
                     Patton, so was one of the few married men of the expedition. His leaders
                     stated, "He was a man of character and ability." He probably kept a journal,
                     but it has not yet been discovered. His journal is said to have been lost while
                     enroute to France for publication. After the expedition returned, he was one of
                     the party who in 1807 attempted to return the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Chief, Shahaka, to his homeland, but was
                     prevented from doing so by the Arikara Indians. Nathaniel H. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> remained in the army
                     and was a second lieutenant until 1810. He then entered the Indian trade on the
                     upper Mississippi. In 1812 he was attacked at Fort Madison where he nearly lost
                     his life. Two of his men were slain, but he escaped by crossing the ice of the
                     Mississippi. He re-entered the army in 1813, and in 1814 he became a captain.
                     He served in the Battle of New Orleans. Later, he was discharged and he then
                     set up a trading post on the Arkansas River. He married an <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> girl, and they had
                     several children who were all given Indian names. They lived among the <span class="tei_name">Osage</span>s until his death on
                     June 1, 1831. He is buried at <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, Mayes County, Oklahoma, where a monument has been erected to
                     his honor. He is not the same <span class="tei_name">Nathaniel Pryor</span> of Pattie's Narrative. This was Nathaniel "Miguel"
                        <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, born in
                     Kentucky in 1798, and died in Los Angeles in 1850. The family relationship, if
                     any, is not clear, for there were several other <span class="tei_name">Nathaniel Pryor</span>s at this time.  <a href="#nbioroster08" id="lnbioroster08" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

                     DREWYER).</strong>
                  <p>Probably born at Sandwich, Canada, son of Pierre <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> of Detroit, and a Shawnee mother.
                     His father had served with Kenton and as interpreter for George Rogers <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> at Fort McIntosh and at the
                     Great <span class="tei_name">Miami</span>. George was
                     in the U.S. Army at Fort Massac when he was transferred to <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> on November 11, 1803, after
                     some resistance on the part of his commander who did not want to lose him. He
                     was tall, straight, and had black hair and dark eyes. He was adept in the
                     Indian sign language. He was always with one captain or the other in most
                     emergencies and situations of danger where skill, nerve, endurance and cool
                     judgement were needed.</p>
                  <p> After the expedition he lived for a few years at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He
                     bought the land warrants of John <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                        Whitehouse</span>, which, with other land, he sold on April 3, 1807 for
                     $1300.00. As he received $25.00 per month while he served with the expedition,
                     he had the funds to make land purchases. He made a return trip to the Rocky
                     Mountains and gave <span class="tei_name">William
                        Clark</span> considerable topographical details of the mountain country
                     which <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> incorporated into
                     his map of the Northwest. He was killed by the Blackfeet Indians in 1810, not
                     far from the area in which he had the scrape with these Indians while he was
                     with <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> when they
                     made the exploration to the upper Maria's River. He was with the <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> party when he met his

                  <strong>9. P<span class="smallcaps">RIVATE</span> WILLIAM E. BRATTON
                     (BRATTEN).</strong>
                  <p>Born, July 27, 1778, in Augusta County, Virginia, of Irish parentage. He
                     probably is a son of George <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>, or of George's brother, James, who were sons of Capt.
                     Robert <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> and his
                     wife, Mrs. Annie (McFarland) Dunlap. Robert <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> came to America from Donegal,
                     Ireland, about 1740, and later settled in Cowpasture, Augusta County, Virginia.
                     I give these clues to William's ancestry because there is yet some confusion as
                     to just which of the brothers was William's father.</p>
                  <p>It is reported William's family migrated to Kentucky about 1790, and on October
                     20, 1803, William enlisted under <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> for the expedition. Hence he is usually listed as one
                     of the "Nine young men from Kentucky." His middle name may be Elliott, for it
                     appears this was his mother's name. This "E" was adopted during his Indiana
                     years to distinguish him from another William <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>, probably his cousin, who also
                     lived near Waynetown, Indiana, and with whom he has often been confused.</p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">William E. Bratton</span> was
                     over six feet tall, square of build, very straight and erect, rather reserved,
                     economical, of fine intelligence and the strictest morals. At an early age he
                     was apprenticed to a blacksmith, possibly his father, or uncle, James, and
                     later became an excellent gunsmith and blacksmith on the expedition. In these
                     capacities, and as a hunter, he was a useful man.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition had reached the mouth of the Columbia River in November
                     1805, <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> and four
                     companions were assigned to salt making at the seashore. They produced enough
                     salt for the expedition's winter requirements as well as enough to last them
                     for the return trip to the states. While working at this exposed task, <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> became seriously ill
                     of lumbago. He became so weak that he could hardly walk, although the captains
                     did everything in their power to help him. At long last, on May 24, 1806, an
                     Indian steam bath was constructed as a forlorn hope of saving his life. This
                     proved effective, and soon <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> was able to resume his duties. <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>'s conscientious service was
                     attested to by the discharge he received at the end of the expedition.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition, <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> returned to Kentucky. He lived there for a time, but
                     returned to Missouri where he lived near <span class="tei_name">John Ordway</span> for a few years. He enlisted from Kentucky for the War
                     of 1812, and was one of those surrendered at Frenchtown (now Monroe, Michigan)
                     on January 22, 1813. He sold his warrant for land to a Mr. Samuel Barclay in
                     1816.</p>
                  <p>When aged forty-one, he married on November 25, 1819, Miss Mary H. Maxwell
                     (1796-1875) and they resided for a time at Greenville, Ohio. By the year 1822,
                     in June, William located on some land at Waynetown, Indiana. They were the
                     parents of eight sons and two daughters, one of whom, Griselda Ann, married a
                     Mr. Stephen Fields. It was she who gave the first brief biographical data to
                     Olin D. Wheeler, who incorporated this data into his roster found in his The
                     Trail of Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">William E. Bratton</span> was
                     elected the first justice of the peace of `Wayne township in June 1824, and he
                     served in that capacity for five years. Meanwhile he raised his large family,
                     and now the many <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>
                     descendants are spread over the United States. Apparently one of the sons, S.
                        <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>, came to
                     California during the gold rush of 1849.</p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">William E. Bratton</span> died
                     November 11, 1841, at Waynetown, Indiana, and is buried in the pioneer cemetery
                     there. A monument marks the final resting place of this important man.  <a href="#nbioroster10" id="lnbioroster10" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>

                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> was born in Frederick
                     County, Maryland. His army unit is unknown, but as he went on the muster roll
                     as of January 1, 1804, he was possibly transferred from Capt. <span class="tei_name">Russell Bissell</span>'s Company. He
                     was one of the best hunters of the party. While at Camp du Bois, <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> once noted him as a
                     "blackguard," perhaps because he killed a farmer's pig, and then claimed it was
                     "bear meat." Later this cloud was removed by most excellent service throughout
                     the voyage. He sold his warrant for land to George <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, in September 1806, for $300.00
                     in cash. He was killed while with Ashley in a fight with the Arikara on June 2,
                     1823. He may be the <span class="tei_name">John Collins</span>

                     COULTER).</strong>
                  <p>Born about 1774, near Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia. He was a son of
                     Joseph and Ellen (Shields) <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>
                     and a grandson of Micajah Coalter. When he was about five years old, his
                     parents moved to Maysville, Kentucky. John spent his boyhood in Maysville and
                     as a young man he probably served as a Ranger under Simon Kenton.</p>
                  <p>He was five feet ten inches tall; rather shy; had blue eyes; an open pleasing
                     countenance; was quick minded, courageous and a fine hunter. He was recruited
                     by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> at
                     Maysville on October 15, 1803 — one of the "Nine young men from Kentucky"
                     and a permanent member of the expedition. He was trusted with many special
                     missions while with the party.</p>
                  <p>When the expedition was enroute home, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> was honorably discharged on August 13, 1806. He returned to
                     the Yellowstone with Forest <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                        Dickson</span>, free trappers from Missouri and Illinois. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> had probably known both men
                     during his Maysville days. The partnership with <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> and <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span> lasted only some six weeks, for a
                     falling out had occurred. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>
                     and <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> returned to the
                        <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> during
                     October 1806, and they spent the winter there. In the spring of 1807, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> started for St. Louis alone,
                     and by July he was at the mouth of the Platte River when he encountered, and
                     joined, <span class="tei_name">Manuel</span>
                     <span class="tei_name">Lisa</span>'s trapping party bound for
                     the Yellowstone. They arrived there in October 1807, and <span class="tei_name">Lisa</span> immediately dispatched <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> to the Crow Indians then on the Bighorn
                     River. During 1808–1809, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> trapped the area around the Stinking Water (<span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>) River.</p>
                  <p>By May 1809, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> had returned
                     to St. Louis. He sold his military warrant for land, probably to the land
                     speculator, John G. Comegys. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> soon signed up with Andrew Henry whose trapping expedition
                     was headed for the upper Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> was sent with a party to trap the rich beaver country of the
                     Blackfeet Indians. Because of his past friendship with the Crows —mortal
                     enemies of the Blackfeet— <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> was forced into a conflict with the latter. He escaped from
                     the Blackfeet in the famous encounter in which another Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> member, <span class="tei_name">John Potts</span>, was killed. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> now had enough of the mountains and
                     returned to St. Louis. Back in Missouri, probably in early 1811, he married a
                     woman named "Sallie." Mrs. Dye, in The Conquest, page 311, states, "Coalter
                     – married a squaw." Other traditions say she was a white woman.
                     Whichever, they settled on a farm near Charette, Franklin County, Missouri.
                     They had a son, Hiram <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, who
                     became the father of eight children.</p>

                     Dundee, Missouri, on Tunnel Hill, which was located between the Big and Little
                     Boeuf creeks. A railroad cut was later made which eliminated all trace of this
                     cemetery. The remains were said to have been scattered along the railroad fill.
                     However, in the collections of the St. Charles Historical Society are the books
                     of the Fee Fee Baptist Church Records. An entry is written, "<span class="tei_name">John Colter</span> — a fur trader

                     furnishings were auctioned on December 10, 1813, and brought $124.44½.
                     Sallie, his wife, received an additional $69.00 on January 9, 1815. She had

                  <p>Born about 1774, perhaps in Culpeper County, Virginia. He may have been a
                     grandson of Abraham Field, Jr., who married a Miss Byrd and lived in Culpeper
                     County. One of the sons of Abraham was Col. John Field, born in Culpeper. John
                     married, Anna Rogers <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, an

                     Colonel Field served under George Washington in the Braddock campaign. He lost
                     his life in the Battle of Point Pleasant in October 1774, for which services
                     his heirs were granted a large tract of land in Bourbon County, Kentucky.
                     Another brother, Reuben, served in the 8th and 4th Virginia Regiments, and was
                     present at the surrender of Cornwallis. John had eleven children, and our
                     Joseph and Reuben may have been his sons, or the sons of the brother,

                     — two of the very earliest. They were probably raised in Kentucky and
                     each is listed as one of the "Nine young men from Kentucky." They served the
                     expedition as two of its most valuable men until discharge on October 10, 1806.
                     Both were excellent woodsmen-hunters and were usually involved in every duty of
                     exploration and trust while on the expedition. Joseph was in charge of a small
                     party which explored the lower Yellowstone River. After the expedition, Joseph
                     received a warrant for land located in Franklin County, Missouri. <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> noted he was dead by

                     a good singer, hunter and horseman. He frequently was lost, but always managed

                     by an act of Congress, was pensioned for the loss of his leg. During 1810 he

                     brothers and an older sister. In 1784, his parents emigrated to Pidgeon Forge
                     in what is now Sevier County, Tennessee. Here John ran a mill and a blacksmith
                     shop for his brother-in-law, Samuel Wilson. About 1790, he married Nancy
                     _______, and they had a daughter, Janette. <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> enlisted in the expedition on

                     from Kentucky." He was one of the most valuable men on the expedition, as he
                     was the head blacksmith, gunsmith, boat builder and general repair man for
                     anything needed. His blacksmith work helped keep the party in corn and other
                     foodstuffs for much of the winter and spring of 1804–05.</p>
                  <p>When the expedition returned, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> wrote: "Shields had received the pay of only a

                     allow him something [extra] as an artificer, he has well deserved it." In 1806
                     he received $180.00 in back pay, and in 1807, $178.50 in extra pay (as did the
                     others), plus a warrant for land located in Franklin County, Missouri.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition, he spent a year trapping with his kinsman, Daniel Boone,
                     in Missouri, and the following year with Squire Boone in Indiana. He died in
                     December 1809, and is probably buried among some of his brothers in "Little
                     Flock Baptist Burying Grounds," south of Corydon, Harrison County, Indiana. His
                     wife Nancy, survived him. Their only daughter, Janette, married her cousin,
                     John Tipton, and they left descendants. John Tipton was an executor of his
                        will. <a href="#nbioroster17" id="lnbioroster17" class="ref_link"><sup>[]</sup></a>

                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">Joseph Whitehouse</span> was born
                     about 1775, probably in Fairfax County, Virginia. About 1784, he and his family
                     migrated to Kentucky. They seem to have located in Boyle and Mercer counties,
                     Kentucky. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> lists
                     him as one of the "Nine young men from Kentucky" which would indicate that he
                     grew up in that state.</p>
                  <p>As a young man, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and during one period was
                     stationed at Kaskaskia, Illinois Territory, where he had frequent contact with
                     the traders who trafficked with the Indians on the lower Missouri River. This
                     was a favorite subject of interest to <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, so when he heard that recruits
                     for the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                     expedition were sought, he located the captains with the hope of joining
                     them.</p>
                  <p>He was transferred from Capt. <span class="tei_name">Daniel
                        Bissell</span>'s Company, then at Fort Massac, to the expedition and was
                     entered on the rolls of Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as of January 1, 1804. This would appear to mean that <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, and the other
                     members recruited from other military commands, had remained on the pay-roll of
                     their former units until December 31, 1803, when they were entered upon the
                     pay-roll of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                     Expedition.</p>
                  <p>The Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> journals
                     frequently mention <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> as a "hide-curer" and a "tailor," and record that he
                     often made and repaired the clothes of the men. After the expedition returned,
                        <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> sold his
                     warrant for land of 160 acres to <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> for $280.00. In 1807, a St. Louis court ordered
                     him arrested for debt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>,
                     in his account of the members made during the years 1825–1828, lists the
                     name, <span class="tei_name">Joseph Whitehouse</span>,
                     without comment. This could mean that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not then know the whereabouts of <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> — or that he may still have
                     been living then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">Joseph Whitehouse</span> kept a
                     journal while on the expedition. A portion, apparently the field notes, or
                     actual diary, is printed in Thwaites' edition of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> journals. Recently a revised
                     version of <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>'s
                     journal has been found and now is in the Newberry Library of Chicago. This
                     version has an entry for November 17, 1803, but properly begins with the date,
                     May 14, 1804, when the expedition set out, and ends on April 6, 1806 when the
                     expedition was on the lower Columbia, homeward bound. It would appear that
                        <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, during the
                     fall of 1806, prepared, or had prepared for him, a new, expanded journal with
                     the thought of having it published. He included a preface and announced that
                     his volume would contain a map. This new version is to be published under the
                     able editorship of Dr. Donald Jackson.</p>

                     skilled in sign-talk, so was of valuable assistance to the captains at the

                     engagees as of May 26, 1804. There is no record of wages paid him, so he was
                     probably one of those hired, rather than enlisted, in the party, and was paid
                     in cash by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>
                     when discharged at the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> in the winter of 1804.</p>

                  <strong>50. E<span class="smallcaps">NGAGE</span> JOSEPH COLLIN.</strong>
                  <p>There was a <span class="tei_name">Joseph Collin</span>, a
                     son of Joseph and Marie (Dier) Collin of St. Genevieve de Montreal, Canada, who
                     married Marie Louise Denis dit La Pierre, at Portage des <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>, on July 15, 1818. She
                     was a widow, having been married in 1790 to Louis Clermont, which would
                     indicate the year of birth of our Joseph as about 1770. <a href="#nbioroster34" id="lnbioroster34" class="ref_link"><sup>[]</sup></a>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> states in his journal
                     that <span class="tei_name">Joseph Collin</span> "was a young
                     man who formerly belonged to the North West Company." <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> lists him as a member of the
                     expedition as of May 26, 1804. It is possible that Collin went only as far as
                     the Arikara. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> says (page
                     149) "we left one of our frenchmen with <span class="tei_name">Tabbo</span> [Antoine <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>] and took his Soon (<span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>'s son) in his
                     place."</p>
                  <p>When the party returned from the Pacific they again met this man among the
                     Arikara on August 21, 1806, and "as he wished to return [to St. Louis] the
                     Captains consented" and he was taken along. (<span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, Aug. 22, 1806.)</p>
                  <p>There is no record of wages paid him, so he was probably paid in cash by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>, either at the
                     Arikara or at the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>.</p>

                  <strong>51. E<span class="smallcaps">NGAGE</span> "ROKEY" (ROSS; ROCQUE).</strong>
                  <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> in his journal (page
                     392) calls him "Ross," which suggests that "<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>" is a nickname. There were also many Rocques
                     active in the fur trade at this same time, so perhaps Rocque is the proper form
                     of the name. <a href="#nbioroster35" id="lnbioroster35" class="ref_link"><sup>[]</sup></a>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the split of the parties in the spring of 1805 at the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>, "<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>" obviously remained on the upper
                     Missouri. When the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> party returned to the Arikara on August 22, 1806, they found
                        "<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>" there. They state: "He
                     was one of our engagees as high as the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. This man had spent all his wages and
                     requested to return with us" to St. Louis. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, same date, says : "Ross joined us in order
                     to go down with us."</p>
                  <p>There was a Charles Ross who was an Oregon pioneer in the employ of the
                     Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

                     Newfoundland type dog. This animal was much admired by the natives for his
                     sagacity and they frequently offered to trade for him — which Lewis
                     always refused to do. He had paid $20.00 for him.</p>
               </li><li>FOUR HORSES. <p>These were taken from St. Charles by the hunters to go along
                     the river banks while the boats were being worked upstream. Three horses were
                     lost enroute and the last one was stolen by the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> on September 24,
                     1804. They were valuable to the expedition for they enabled the hunters, in
                     addition to bringing in game, to explore inland from the Missouri. The
                     information thus obtained was added to the captains' written description of the
                     creeks and country of the lower Missouri.</p>

            <p>So here we have a roster of fifty-one men who are recorded at one place or another in
               the various journals as being members of the party. It seems to be the most accurate
               roster that can be determined.</p>
            <p>A few names appear on tentative lists, that do not appear later on the expedition.
               They may be among those temporary men at Camp Woods for a time, but as <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span> states: "Several men who
               voluntered for this expedition, relinquished the honor and privilege when the time
               came to start — in common phrase, they backed out."</p>
            <p>In view of the number of men who returned in the spring of 1805, we need extra men
               above the forty-five stated, to fill the roster. I have attempted to show this
               situation in the "Diary" which follows.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="introdiary introdiary tei_div" id="introdiary">
            <h4>Introduction to the Diary</h4>
            <p>I have compiled this composite "Diary" from the Biddle condensation of the Lewis and
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> journals, The Original
               Journals of Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and the
               journals of <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span> and <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>.
               These, with The Field Notes of <span class="tei_name">William
                  Clark</span>, are all the journals known at this time. In this compilation, I have
               selected those entries which concern the men, their health and welfare, with only
               enough material to set the locale and scene of each day's activities. I have tried to
               preserve the language of the journalists, but have had to use words of my own in
               order to connect the statements made by the various journalists. As all the
               descriptions of geography, ethnology, zoology, botany, mineralogy, meteorology and
               astronomy are omitted in this compilation, the result becomes a relation principally
               of the men, and therefore runs the risk of reading like a glorious hunting
               expedition. When one considers that the command practically lived off the land for
               more than two and a half years, then he realizes the great numbers of game animals
               required to feed and clothe the men. In some cases trivial matter is retained only
               because the name of the member is mentioned.</p>
            <p>In no sense is this "Diary" intended as a substitute for, nor a one volume
               condensation of, any of the journals. The real purpose of the expedition was not to
               extoll its members, but to explore and describe a new frontier. This purpose can only
               be found by a study of the original journals. As the men are rather lost in the maze
               of descriptive matter found there, the aim of this condensation is to bring them back
               into sight. It reveals their personalities and characters, and for that reason may be
               needed. As such, this con densation differs from Bernard DeVoto's excellent one
               volume edition of The Journals of Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, Boston, 1953, which retains the spelling and punctuation of the
               original journals.</p>
            <p>While some men receive more notice than others, yet it is a picture of them all, and
               one can sense the skills and qualifications of the men who overcame the various
               problems — and who made this particular expedition so successful. The reader
               becomes aware of the excellent planning of the commanders; their care to keep the men
               in good health under the most trying conditions; of their foibles and strength; their
               good times, hard times and sickness. Always apparent is the concern of the whole
               party to make the objects of the expedition a success. That this was accomplished at
               a considerable risk of life is evident by the continual detailing of a few men who
               were sent ahead, or remained behind, the main party, to secure food for the command's
               sustenance.</p>
            <p>Where one journal may state "sent out 5 hunters," from another I have obtained the
               names of the men, and have inserted their names when found, into the text. In those
               entries where no names are given, it is because no journal records them. In several
               cases I have found that the various journals do not always agree on the events of a
               given day. It is to be remembered that frequently these journals were written days
               after the event had occurred. I have had to select that which seemed to be the
               accurate description. I have also incorporated into the text, for the convenience of
               the reader, modern names of rivers, and the full names of traders—with a brief
               identification taken from other sources.</p>
            <p>In view of this "Diary" being a composite of several writers, I have not felt it
               necessarry to retain their spelling and punctuation. In those cases where I have
               added material not found in the journal of a member, I have enclosed such matter in
               [brackets] and have given a citation to its source. </p>
            <p> Let us return to St. Charles and begin the "Diary" on the day the expedition left
               that village.</p>

               <p>All the fore-part of the day we were arranging our party and preparing the

                  the afternoon, under three cheers from the gentlemen on the bank, and proceeded on
                  to the head of an island. We left four of our Frenchmen in St. Charles to finish

                  himself at twenty feet, and with his knife, he dug in and saved himself. It was a

                  wheeled the keel-boat; broke the tow-rope, and was near to over-setting the boat.
                  All hands jumped out, and by the means of swimmers, we got a rope fast to the
                  stern. We were near lost as the boat wheeled a third time before we got her to
                  shore. At this place George <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Alexander
                     Willard</span>, the two men we had left at St. Charles to bring on the horses,
                  joined us.</p>

               <p>We set out early as usual, and enroute we met Mr. Regis <span class="tei_name">Loisel</span>, a St. Louis merchant, on his way down
                  from Cedar Island. He gave us much information in regard to the Indians up river.
                  We passed St. Johns, [La Charette] a poor village— the last white settlement
                  on the Missouri River. The People gave us milk and butter.</p>

               <p>While passing through a narrow pass between an island and the main river, the men
                  had trouble with moving sand-bars. The current was swift and the river banks were
                  undercut, and they were caving down into the river. The boat wheeled so rapidly
                  that the men were almost swept off their feet. The active exertions of the men
                  prevented the boat from turning and being capsized. Again <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> had cause to appreciate his men: "We

                  like a turkey. When he fired his gun, the noise was increased. [This happened on

               <p>Some of the men with Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> looked for ash timber to make oars. They got enough to make
                  twenty oars. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and
                  another hunter came in with more game, and also a young horse they had found in
                  the prairie. Our party is afflicted with boils, and several have dysentery, which
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> attributes to the
                  muddy water of the river. The boats were moved against the river by several
                  methods. With a fair wind, the sails were used. With insufficient wind, the oars
                  were used, and in narrow places with shallow water, poles were employed. Soldiers
                  on both sides of the keel-boat, facing the stem, placed their poles in the bed of
                  the stream and the first in line walked aft, pushing on the pole; the next in line
                  followed in order, while those who had completed their maneuver, returned to the
                  bow to fall in line again. Where the current was too swift and the river too deep
                  for the poles, cordelling was resorted to. The rope was passed to men pulling from
                  the shore, and the steersmen kept the rudder set so as to keep the craft from
                  being pulled towards shore. All this was hard work, and the French engages
                  complained for the want of food — saying they were accustomed to five or six
                  meals a day. The captains roughly rebuked them for this presumption, for the other
                  men seemed to manage well.</p>

                  They think it might be caused by some hominy they ate. The large red pirogue ran a

                  plain. The pirogue was unloaded and some of the baggage was found to be damaged.
                  The captains are still thinking of sending one of the pirogues back to St. Louis.
                  The Fields brothers, who were sent to look for <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and the horses, joined us and informed us

                  on the opposite shore. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and young Dorion carried over to them some hominy, kettles,
                  tobacco, etc. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>

                  and his party with a fat dog, already cooked, of which they heartily partook and
                  found well flavored. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  is engaged in writing a speech, as the Indians are to meet with us tomorrow. The

               <p>We prepared some presents and medals which we intend to give to the Indians. We
                  sent Old Dorion over in a pirogue for the chiefs and warriors to bring them to our
                  council. At 12 o'clock we met, and Capt. Lewis delivered a speech in which he
                  explained the change in government, enjoined them to make peace, and invited them
                  to send a chief to our President in Washington to receive his good counsel. We
                  smoked the pipe-of- peace and gave them presents of clothes, tobacco, a flag,
                  medals, cockedhats and uniforms. The chiefs retired to divide their presents,
                  while Captains Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                  went to dinner and to consult about other matters. Old Dorion was displeased that
                  he was not invited to have dinner with them, and the captains were sorry that they
                  had overlooked inviting him. The air gun was fired, and it was explained that this
                  gun was our great medicine, and that the gun could do great harm. After a few
                  firings, the Indians ran to the trees to see the holes the shots had made, and
                  they shouted aloud at the execution this gun could do. At night a circle was
                  formed about the camp fires. The chiefs looked on with great dignity while the
                  warriors danced until late at night. <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> have

               <p>The Indians remained with us all day. They want Old Dorion and his son to stay
                  with them so that he could accompany their chief to Washington. The chiefs
                  returned a speech with an eloquent account of their dire poverty, etc. They said
                  they would make peace with the Pawnee and <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>, and said one of them would visit our
                  President next spring. They also wished the captains would give them something for
                  their squaws. The captains told them we were not traders, but had only come to
                  make the road open for the traders who would follow, and who would supply their
                  wants at better terms than they had ever had before. We learned much of their
                  habits and customs, which we collect for our Government. The captains gave them
                  more tobacco and corn to take to their lodges. We commissioned Old Dorion to make
                  peace with all the chief nations in the neighborhood. We gave him a flag and some
                  clothes. He received this with pleasure and promised to do all that was necessary.
                  The chiefs sent their young men home, while they stayed to wait for Mr. Dorion. We
                  gave Dorion a bottle of whiskey, and he and his son — with the chiefs
                  — crossed to the other side of the river to camp.</p>

                  had to lighten the keel-boat, for we found, because of the low water and
                  sand-bars, that we could not proceed with the present loading. We have been
                  planning, as instructed, to send a pirogue back to St. Louis, but our captains now
                  concluded to detain her, and her crew of soldiers under Cpl. Warfington, until
                  spring. We put some of the load of the keel-Boat into the red pirogue. The hunting
                  party under <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>,
                  obtained buffalo, elk, antelope and a magpie. We use the buffalo skins to cover

                  were not afraid of any Indians. We told them that some of their men had stolen a
                  horse sent by their Great Father, and that we would not speak to them any more

               <p>We raised a flag pole over our camp and put up an awning and a sand-bar in
                  readiness for the Indians. At 10 o'clock they came — about fifty in number.
                  We gave them food and tobacco. They have some captive <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> squaws, so Cruzatte could talk to them, and
                  they in return, translated into <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>. The captains in this manner delivered a speech, gave medals and
                  presents of knives, clothes, a cocked-hat, and other small articles. We paraded
                  our party and invited the chiefs on board the boat. There we showed them many
                  curiosities and gave them a half wine glass of whiskey. They took up an empty
                  bottle and soon began to be troublesome. One of them, "The <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>," pretended to be drunk and reeled about the
                  boat. With some difficulty, <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span> took the other chiefs ashore and tried to reconcile them, but as
                  he landed, three warriors seized the cable. The chief who affected drunkenness was
                  exceedingly insolent both in words and gestures, saying we could not depart. He
                  said that they were poor and would keep our pirogue, and that they had soldiers as
                  well as we. Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, in
                  moderation, told them we had a long way to go — and would go — and
                  that we were not squaws, but soldiers. The chief's insults became so personal, and
                  his intentions so evident to do us injury, that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> at last drew his sword, and at this
                  motion, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> ordered the
                  men in the boat under arms. The large swivel gun was loaded with buck-shot. The
                  five men who were with <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  had previously taken up their guns with full determination to defend him if
                  necessary. The Grand Chief, "<span class="tei_name">Black
                     Buffalo</span>," then took hold of the cable and sent the young warriors off,
                  and the lesser chiefs went to the Indian party about twenty yards back. All of
                  them had their bows strung and guns cocked. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> felt warm and spoke in positive terms
                  to them all, but principally to the First Chief. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> offered him his hand, but the chief
                  refused it — but let the rope go and went to his party. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> pushed the pirogue off and had not gone
                  far when the First Chief and three principal men walked into the water and
                  requested to come on board. They were taken in and we proceeded about a mile and
                  anchored near a small island which <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> named "Bad Humored Island." The four Indians stayed with us all

               <p>We set out early but soon came to to let the squaws and boys see the boat as the
                  chiefs had requested. Great numbers of men, women and children were on the banks
                  watching us. They are fond of dress and show, and appeared spritely, but generally
                  ill looking. After landing, Capt. Lewis and five men, including <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, went on shore with
                  the chief who appeared to want to make up and be friendly. After <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> had been on shore
                  about three hours, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  became uneasy for fear of deception, and sent a sergeant to see him. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> reported all was well
                  and that the Indians wanted us to remain one more night so that they could show
                  their good disposition towards us — so we determined to remain. After <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> returned to the boat,
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> went on shore. He
                  was received on an elegant buffalo robe and was carried to the village by six
                  warriors and was not permitted to touch the ground until he was put down in the
                  grand council house on a white, dressed robe. Under this shelter, about seventy
                  men sat in a circle and the pipe-of-peace was smoked. A large fire was near in
                  which food was cooking. Soon after they sat <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> down, the warriors went for <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and they brought him
                  back in the same manner. An old man arose and spoke in approval of what we had
                  done, and informed us of their situation, requesting us to take pity on them. We
                  told him the Great Father wanted his children to live in peace and that he would
                  want them to give up the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> prisoners and make peace with that nation. After much talk, the
                  Great Chief then rose and with great state he spoke to the same purpose. With
                  great solemnity he took up the pipe-of-peace, lit it, and presented the stem to us
                  to smoke. He took some of the most delicate parts of the dog which had been
                  prepared for the feast, and made an offering to the flag to acknowledge transfer
                  of the country. We smoked for an hour until dark when all was cleared away. A
                  large fire was made in the center and about ten musicians beat on tambourines. Men
                  and women came on highly decorated and proceeded to dance the War Dance. They did
                  this with great cheerfulness until about midnight, when we informed the chiefs
                  that they must be tired. Accompanied by four chiefs, we returned to the boat, and
                  they stayed with us all night. They promise to deliver the prisoners to Mr.
                  Dorion. All of our men are on board, anchored about one hundred paces from shore.
                  Everyone is in high spirits this evening [Nothing is mentioned about the recovery

                  others took them on shore and they left us with reluctance, but we are still alert
                  for any treachery. They offered the captains a young woman for companionship,
                  which was refused. At dark the dance was begun as usual, performed as last night.
                  About 11 p.m., we returned to the boats with two chiefs, but by bad steering, the
                  pirogue struck the keel-boat's cable with such force as to break it near the
                  anchor. The chiefs became frightened and alarmed, and the Indians came down in
                  great haste, armed for action. They found the incident harmless, but about twenty
                  of them camped on shore all night. As we had lost our anchor, we were obliged to
                  lay to under a bank much exposed to the hostile intentions of these <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> whom we had every
                  reason to believe intended to stop our boats and rob us. Peter Cruzatte came in at
                  night and informed us that the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> prisoners told him that the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> intended to stop us. Under Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, a guard was kept all night, but
                  we showed no sign of our knowledge of these evil intentions.</p>

               <p>We made many diligent attempts to find our anchor without success, for the sand
                  had covered it up. We were determined to proceed, and after breakfast we, with
                  great difficulty, got all the chiefs but the First Chief, out of the boat. When we
                  were about setting out, the Indian soldiers took possession of the cable. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, who was still aboard,
                  was informed of this. He went to <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span>, who was at the bow, and told him the warriors wanted tobacco.
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> was nearing
                  giving orders to cut the rope and fire on them. He said to the chief : "You told
                  us you are a great man and have influence; now show your influence by taking the
                  rope from these men." This appealed to his pride and had the desired effect. We
                  gave a twist of tobacco to the First Chief who gave it to his men. The chief took
                  the cable from them and gave it to us. We proceeded under a favorable breeze. We
                  took in the Number Three Chief who was waiting two miles above. He told us that
                  the Number Two Chief, the one who had pretended drunkenness, was a double-spoken
                  man. Soon afterward, we saw a man riding full speed up the bank. We brought him
                  aboard, and later sent him back with a talk for his nation, i.e. — if they
                  were for peace, they were to stay at home–and if they were for war, or
                  determined to stop us — then we were ready to defend ourselves. We
                  substituted large stones for an anchor, and stopped at a small island in the
                  middle of the river. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  feels unwell from all the tension and lack of sleep. Under the circumstances,

                  two squaws on shore. They wanted to come on board, but we refused to let any more
                  sail with us. They offered us the squaws but we told them that we would not speak
                  to another <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  except the one on board — and he could go ashore anytime he pleased. We
                  proceeded on until evening, the Indians still following — when our chief
                  requested to be put ashore — which we did. We later camped on the south side

                  women and children descending the banks towards the river, above which the chief
                  told us there was another band of <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> of about four hundred souls. About 10 a.m., we anchored opposite
                  the camps of this band. We told them that we took them by the hand as friends. As
                  a token of this we would send to each chief a twist of tobacco, and some to the
                  principal men. We also said we had been badly treated by the band below, and would
                  not land again, as we had not time to delay. They wanted us to eat with them, but
                  we declined, and proceeded under a double-reefed sail. The chief on board tossed
                  to those who ran along the shore small pieces of tobacco and told them to open
                  their ears to our councils. About 4 p.m., we went to shore to take on some
                  fire-wood. When we put off, the stern got fast. The boat swam around in the
                  stream, and as the wind was high, she got in the trough of the waves and rocked
                  very much before we got her straightened out. The chief on board was very much
                  afraid and ran and hid himself. He said our boat was bad medicine and, would not
                  go further with us. Our captains gave him a blanket, knife, some tobacco and put
                  him on shore. We told him to keep his men away from us. We camped on a sand-bar,

                  Frenchman. He was recognized by one of our engages. We brought him over to the
                  boat in one of the pirogues. We then came to a trading post where Mr. Jean Valle
                  and two men kept a few goods to trade with the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>. Mr. Valle gave us information of the Cheyenne

                  afternoon we discovered some Indians on the hills, and one of them came down to
                  the river. He told us he wanted us to come ashore. We told him we had spoken to
                  his chief — and proceeded on. We expected to be attacked around the next
                  bend — and were ready for them. Nothing happened, so we went on. We camped
                  on a sand bar, one half mile from shore. There was no hunting today for the

                  to get into the proper channel. We saw several Indians on the bank and they yelled
                  and skipped a ball before us. One swam to us and begged for powder. We gave him a

                  remarkably stout, strong negro), he showed them feats of strength, which, added to
                  his looks, made him more terrible than we wished him to be. He told them that

                  them flags, medals, cloth, paints, etc. After the council, we shot the air gun
                  which astonished them. We observed two of the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> in our council whom we had seen below. We were

                  watermelons and a kind of tobacco. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> observes that this tobacco answers for smoking, but not for

                  people gave us about seven bushels of corn, some tobacco, seeds, leggins and a
                  robe. We continued on to another village where ten bushels of corn, summer squash
                  and beans were given us. We gave them sugar, salt and a sun-glass each. One of
                  them went with us to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. They have an unusual custom of showing appreciation. They
                  think they cannot show sufficient acknowledgment without offering their guests
                  their handsome squaws. They are displeased if the squaws are not received. The
                  squaws are very insistent about it and followed us to our camp. Our men found no
                  difficulty in procuring companions for the night. <span class="tei_name">York</span> participated in these favors, for the maidens desired to preserve
                  among them some living memorial of this wonderful stranger. An Arikara invited him

                  the gallant husband would permit no interruption until a reasonable time had

                  upon every white man as an inferior being. One chief admitted that he admired the
                  air gun, as it could discharge forty shots at one load, but he dreaded the magic
                  of its owners. He said, "Had I these white warriors on the upper plains, my young
                  men on horseback would soon do for them as they would do for so many wolves. There
                  are only two sensible men among them, the worker of iron and the mender of guns."

                  ice about them lies in several strata of unequal thickness, and are separated with
                  streams of water. When we cut through one thickness, the water gushes up so high
                  that it is impossible to cut away at the lower strata. As a last resort we are
                  preparing some iron spikes, attached to poles, to pry the boats up. We have
                  already prepared a large rope of elk skins, and a windlass for pulling it.</p>

               <p>We were visited by many natives who brought corn for blacksmith's work. We were
                  running out of iron, so the blacksmith uses an old iron stove which we had used,
                  and had burnt out while we were ascending the Missouri, as a source. He makes iron
                  scrapers and battle axes for them. A piece about four inches square will trade for
                  seven or eight gallons of corn. The blacksmiths, Shields, <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>, are our greatest resource for

                  which mentioned the wish of their Grand Chief to visit the President, and
                  requesting permission for himself and four men to join our boat when it descends.
                  The captains consent to this as it will then be manned by fifteen hands and be
                  able to defend itself against the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>. [Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> says there were thirteen men in
                  the returning party.]</p>
               <p>The Arikara Chief, Kah-hah We-to (Raven Brave), requested that one of his men who
                  was lame, might descend in the boat. This we agree to. We have but little doubt
                  that the returning party will be fired on by the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>, but they have pledged themselves to us that
                  they will not yield while there is a man of them living.</p>
               <p>We dismissed the keel-boat and crew, with orders to return without loss of time to
                  St. Louis. A small canoe with two Frenchmen accompanies the keel-boat. These men
                  had ascended the Missouri with us last year as engages. The keel-boat crew
                  consisted of six soldiers and two Frenchmen. Two Frenchmen and a lame Arikara also
                  take passage down in her as far as the Arikara villages, at which place they
                  expect Mr. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> to
                  embark with his party, who in that case will make an addition of two, perhaps
                  four, men to the crew of the keel-boat. We gave <span class="tei_name">Richard Warfington</span>, our corporal, the charge
                  of the keel-boat and crew, and confided to his care our maps and dispatches to the
                  Government, letters to our private friends, and a number of articles to the
                  President of the United States.</p>
               <p>One of the Frenchmen, Mr. <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                     Gravelines</span>, an honest, discreet man and an excellent boatman, is
                  employed to conduct the keel-boat as its pilot. Mr. <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> speaks the Arikara language, and he
                  has also been employed to conduct a few of the Arikara chiefs to the seat of
                  government in Washington.</p>

               <p>[Due to the frequent departures and arrivals of unnamed Frenchmen during the past

                  certain just which Frenchmen accompanied the keel-boat on its return. It would
                  appear that the return party was :</p>

                     Francois Rivet</li><li>15. Trapper, Phillipe Degie</li></ul>
               <p>The above is the basic evidence for my assumption that the original party set out
                  with fifty-one men. <span class="tei_name">John
                     Robertson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Peter
                     Pinaut</span> had early on the trip been sent back. <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Charles Floyd</span> had died, Joseph Barter had
                  deserted and <span class="tei_name">Robert Frazier</span> had
                  been transfered to the permanent party. Ross, alias "<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>," <span class="tei_name">Alexander
                     Carson</span> and Peter Roi, seem to be the Frenchmen who returned to the
                  Arikara when the Frenchmen were discharged on November 2, 1804. Another Frenchman,
                  Grenier (Grienyea), though never a member of the party, was at Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> at different times
                  during the winter, and did come up with the expedition from the Arikara villages.
                  He may be one of the Frenchmen mentioned, along with Joseph Collin, as going back
                  and forth between Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and the Arikara. It also appears that Grenier, Ross ("<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>") , and Francois Rivet returned to
                  the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> in 1806, for
                  they seem to be the Frenchmen found there by the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition when the permanent party returned
                  from the Pacific. These three, with Phillip Degie, had stayed with the Arikara at
                  least part of the winter of 1805–1806]</p>
               <p>[While no journals seem to have been kept by Cpl. Warfington nor any members of
                  his return party, we do know a few details of their voyage. After leaving Fort
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, they stopped at
                  the Arikara village and took aboard an Arikara chief and his party. Mr. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Gravelines</span> conducted the
                  chief to St. Louis and then on to Washington, where the chief died. Some of the
                  Frenchmen remained with the Arikara such as Francois Rivet, Phillipe Degie, "<span class="tei_name">Rokey</span>" and possibly <span class="tei_name">Joseph Collin</span>. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> later reported that "<span class="tei_name">John Newman</span> was extremely serviceable
                  as a hunter on the voyage to St. Louis, and that the boat, on several occasions,
                  owed her safety in a great measure, to his personal exertions, being a man of
                  uncommon activity and bodily strength."  <a href="#nch0701" id="lnch0701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>The party reached St. Louis on May 20, 1805, and turned the Indians, the reports,
                  letters and crates of natural history objects over to Charles Gratiot, who was
                  acting agent during the absence of <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                  to discharge upon termination of the voyage, some of them returned to civilian
                  life. Others, such as <span class="tei_name">Richard
                     Warfington</span>, re-enlisted with their former units. They all had been
                  discharged as of June 1, 1805, having performed their assignment with

                     <p>Charbonneau was born in Canada of French parents about the year 1758. He was
                        enlisted as an interpreter and engage on March 18, 1805. He had previously
                        been employed by the North West Company as a trader. He was verbose and
                        excitable. At one time he had lived among the Minnitaree where in 1794 he is
                        reported to have won <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> in
                        a gambling game from Red Arrow, her Indian captor. Other than as an
                        interpreter for the party, he was not of much value. After the party's
                        return from the Pacific to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> again, he, his wife and son, remained
                        with the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. He
                        was with Major Long's expedition to the Rocky Mountains. He came down to St.
                        Louis in 1811 with his three children who were turned over to Governor <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> to educate, and
                        then he returned to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. In 1839 he came back to St. Louis, aged eighty, having
                        served the United States Government as an interpreter from 1819 to
                     1838.</p>

                     <p>
                        <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was a <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> girl born

                        She had been captured by the Minnitaree when about 12 years old, and later
                        became one of the wives of Charbonneau. She was a valuable guide in the far,
                        upper Missouri country, and was as brave a soldier as any of them. She was
                        virtuous, modest and unexcitable. She gave birth to a son, Jean Baptiste, on
                        February 11, 1805, while at Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, and carried the infant to the Pacific

                     <p>
                        <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste
                           Charbonneau</span> was born February 11, 1805, in Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, the son of <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>
                        and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>. He was nicknamed
                           <span class="tei_name">Pomp</span> — meaning a
                        leader or head man — a title often given the first-born of a <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> mother.</p>
                     <p>About 1810, according to the promise given to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> by his parents, he was brought
                        down to St. Louis to be reared and educated by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. About 1821, Jean Baptiste apparently
                        entered the service of the Missouri Fur Company. In October, 1823, Prince
                        Paul, Duke of Wurttemberg— highly impressed with the outstanding young
                        man — took him to Germany for an education in Europe. In late 1829,
                        they returned to Missouri. Jean Baptiste went to the mountains, probably
                        with Drips and Fontenelle, in the spring of 1830. Then followed many years
                        in various capacities as a fur trapper-trader with several outfits. Later he
                        was an interpreter for Fremont, Emory, Abert and several others.</p>
                     <p>He is said to have worn his hair long, was the best man on foot on the
                        plains and mountains and an active and useful man. Several writers who met
                        him note his fine character, pleasant manners and particularly fine
                        education. He could converse in English, French, German, Spanish as well as
                        several Indian languages.</p>
                     <p>In 1846, <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste
                           Charbonneau</span> went to California as a guide for the Mormon Battalion
                        commanded by Philip St. George Cooke. Then he served as alcalde at the San
                        Luis Rey district of San Diego. When gold was discovered in northern
                        California, Jean Baptiste went up there to seek his fortune. With his old
                        friend, Jim Beckwourth, he mined on the Middle Fork of the American River
                        and at other places in Placer County for several wears — always

                        mines in Montana. Enroute, he died of pneumonia about the first of May,

               <p>We hoisted the sails in the white pirogue and sailed under a favorable wind until
                  afternoon. About 2 p.m., a sudden squall struck and turned the pirogue so much on
                  its side, as to alarm Charbonneau who was steering. In his excitement, he threw
                  the pirogue into the wind, which nearly upset her. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> took the helm, and the sails were

                  was the most steady and safe boat we had, hence the loading. Our party caught
                  eight beaver, and the three Frenchmen, seven, last evening. As there appeared to

               <p>Our men are hunting bears. This evening Charbonneau was at the helm of the white
                  pirogue instead of <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>,
                  who was ashore with the captains. Charbonneau cannot swim, and is perhaps the most
                  timid waterman in the world. In this pirogue were embarked our papers,
                  instruments, books, medicine and the greater part of our Indian goods. The pirogue
                  was under sail when a sudden squall of wind hit her, and Charbonneau, instead of
                  putting her before the wind, luffed her into it — and she went to one side.
                  Cruzatte gave orders repeatedly to take hold of the rudder, and at last Cruzatte
                  himself saved her. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>

                  first caught sight of a distant view of the Rocky Mountains — the object of
                  our hopes, and the rewards of our ambitions. We came to a rapids, which by
                  doubling the crews, and using both the ropes and poles, we ascended with great
                  difficulty. Capt. Lewis walked among the hills and killed a fat buffalo which we

               <p>Last night we were alarmed by a large buffalo bull which swam over from the
                  opposite side and clambered over the white pirogue in attempting to land. He then
                  ran full speed towards where the men were asleep, missing their heads by inches.
                  He then took a direction towards the captain's tent. <span class="tei_name">Scannon</span> chased him off. The camp was in an uproar, but no
                  one was hurt. In crossing the pirogue, the buffalo trod on <span class="tei_name">York</span>'s rifle and bent it, and shattered the stock of a
                  blunderbuss. It seems to us that the white pirogue is attended by some evil genii,

                  sometimes have to walk over yards of sharp rocks. At noon, the captains gave the

               <p>We moved our camp over to the point between the two rivers. Both are equally large
                  so we had to determine which of these rivers is the true Missouri. To choose the
                  wrong stream might lose us the whole season, and would probably dishearten the
                  party and defeat the expedition altogether. To this end, an investigation of both
                  streams was the first thing to be done. We dispatched two canoes with three men
                  each up these two rivers with instructions to discover the bearing of these rivers
                  by ascending the rising grounds. The parties are to return by evening. The men
                  seem to feel that the north fork [the Maria's] is the real Missouri, but the
                  captains reserve the opinion that the south fork is the correct one. We are
                  astonished that the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>
                  Indians had not given us more precise information. The party in camp is busy
                  dressing skins for clothing. Many of them can scarcely walk because of mangled and
                  bruised feet. The canoe parties returned in the evening with their reports. Sgt.
                     <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> had ascended the
                  north fork and had taken distances. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> with <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                     Whitehouse</span> had ascended the south fork. The Fields brothers had walked
                  up the north fork some seven miles. Their reports were not convincing of the
                  fundamental points, so the captains concluded to ascend both rivers far enough to
                  observe the main direction the rivers took so that they could satisfy themselves
                  on the one which would be most expedient to take for the journey to the Pacific.
                  They gave orders for Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>,
                  Shields, <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>, Cruzatte and

                  espontoon, would have been precipitated into the river down a craggy precipice of
                  about ninety feet. He reached a place where he could stand and heard <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>'s voice behind him saying
                  "Good God, Captain, what shall I do?" <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> turned and found that <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> had lost his foothold and had slipped

               <p>We determined to deposit at this place the large red pirogue and all the heavy
                  baggage which we could possibly do without — along with some provisions,
                  salt, blacksmith's tools, powder and lead. We do this to lighten our vessels, and
                  at the same time, add to them the crew of the seven hands who heretofore have been
                  employed in navigating the red pirogue. We sent a party of seven men to dig a hole
                  to bury the goods. Peter Cruzatte, being acquainted with the method of making a
                  cache, was left the supervision of constructing it. Cruzatte is an old Missouri
                  navigator, and from his integrity, knowledge and skill as a waterman, has acquired
                  the confidence of every individual of the party. Cruzatte declared it is of his
                  opinion that the north fork is the true Missouri — and could be no other.
                  Finding the men so determined in this belief, and wishing that if the captains
                  were in error to detect it and rectify it as soon as possible, it was agreed among
                  the captains that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>
                  would take a small party by land up the south fork until they found the Great

                  with the canoes the day after tomorrow. Some of our arms and the air-gun needed

                  about making the repairs. <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                     <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> was sent to his

                     <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> to his left to hunt.
                  Later all were to join at the river to take dinner. Soon <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> called that he could hear the sound of
                  falling water. The roar increased as the party advanced. At noon they reached the
                  Falls of the Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> sat on the top of some rocks opposite the center of the falls to
                  gaze on this sublimely grand spectacle which, from the commencement of time, has
                  been concealed from the view of civilized man. He determined to send <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> down in the morning to
                  inform <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and his party
                  of this important discovery, and to settle in their minds all doubts as to the
                  real Missouri. The hunters arrived, loaded with excellent buffalo meat. Others had
                  been killed, so we encamped to dry the meat. <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> has caught a half dozen very fine trout.
                  Our fare was really sumptuous this evening.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the party under <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span> was working its way upstream. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> is still sick. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> is also very sick, and some of the men are still troubled

                  resolved to try on <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>. Six men

                  Two hunters went to get elk skins to cover the iron frame boat. We had trouble
                  with the canoes in the rapids — one turned upside down and nearly drowned

               <p>We drew the white pirogue on shore into a thick bunch of willows, fastened her
                  securely, drove out the plugs in her bottom, and covered her with bushes and
                  driftwood to hide and shelter her from the sun. We now selected a place for a

                  than she ate heartily of the raw, white (tuber) apples, together with a

                  that sticks be set up on the prairie to mark the way of the portage. There are
                  several ravines that have to be avoided. Not having seen any Indians, nor knowing
                  if in fact they could be depended upon for friendship or hostility, we have
                  conceived that our party is already small, and have concluded therefore not to
                  dispatch a canoe with part of our men back to St. Louis, as we had intended to do
                  when we made our plans this spring. The captains had never hinted to any of the
                  party that they had such a scheme in contemplation. The men all appear to have
                  made up their minds to succeed in this expedition, or perish in the attempt. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> called attention to the
                  noises which sounded like a cannon being fired some distance away. We are at a

                  say that these Rocky Mountains make a great noise. It is possible that they have

                  which, he cut his hand and knee, but had a fortunate escape. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and Shields found a little bark and timber, and
                  brought back two elk. Elk skins are best for covering the frame boat, for they are

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> determined to visit
                  the large fountain or giant spring that was discovered by <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> on the 18th. He set out with <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> in a violent wind and
                  rain storm which thoroughly drenched them. The other men continue to work on the
                  iron boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> at the lower camp,
                  decided to ascend the river to remake the sketches he had lost in the wind at the
                  time of his first discovery. With him went <span class="tei_name">York</span>, Charbonneau, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>
                  and Baptiste, the baby. The storm approaching, they sought shelter in a ravine
                  with shelving rocks under which they took cover. A sudden cloud-burst quickly
                  filled the ravine with a torrent of water. Shoving <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and the baby before him, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and Charbonneau climbed up the steep
                  bluff just in time to escape from being washed away. This ravine was just above
                  the great cataract of the Missouri where, had they been swept into it, they must
                  have inevitably perished. <span class="tei_name">York</span> was hunting
                  buffalo at the time, so was not in the ravine, but he was alarmed for their
                  safety. Charbonneau lost his gun, shot-pouch, horn and tomahawk. The baby's cradle
                  and clothes were swept away. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                  was afraid that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> would have a
                  relapse from her recent illness. Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> lost his large compass and an elegant fusee, a tomahawk and an
                  umbrella. The compass is a severe loss, for we have no other large one.</p>
               <p>The canoe party during the excessive heat which had preceded the storm had removed
                  their clothes and were practically naked when the storm overtook them. The large
                  hailstones bruised and knocked them about, and cut the scalps of their heads. They
                  were compelled to camp out on the road over night again. The men at the upper camp
                  were in good order under the willow trees, but were concerned for the men on the
                  road. But it all came out well, and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> used some of the hailstones to make a bowl of punch.</p>

                  on the portage road to move it along. The search party found the compass! Four men

                  cover for the boat is finished and was put into the water to toughen before sewing

                  have not been able to obtain pitch from our kiln, which causes some embarrassment.
                  Some hunters were sent ahead to kill buffalo so that we can make pemmican. We were
                  told that we would leave the buffalo country shortly after passing the falls. If
                  so, we will miss the white puddings that Charbonneau makes. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> fears the boat will be a blunder and
                  useless, for the lack of pitch to seal the seams which had to be sewn together
                  with a coarse needle. The boat looks good and is very light in proportion to its
                  size. The river looks so gentle above the falls that all the men are anxious to be
                  moving onward. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> having
                  been engaged until now on the boat, has not yet seen the Great Falls. He, <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> and three others were permitted

                  working on the canoes and repairing moccasins. A good pair will not last more than
                  two days in this country. The <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>
                  party returned from the falls, bringing the tongues and brains from the buffalo

               <p>We turned the iron boat over and built small fires under her to dry the skin, and
                  applied pitch and tallow to the seams. We hear those noises towards the north-west
                  when the weather is calm. <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                  perilous part of our journey, yet no one repines, and all appear ready to meet any
                  difficulties which might await us. Our work being completed, we had a drink of
                  spirits — the last of our stock — save a little reserved for sickness.
                  The fiddle was played by Cruzatte, and the men danced until 9 p.m. Festive jokes
                  and songs prevailed, and the men were merry until late at night. Thus we

                  Three other men visited the falls today — the last of the party who have not

                  charcoal- tallow-beeswax composition to the boat. It gives her the appearance of

                  to be unloaded. The composition separated from the skins and left the seams
                  exposed, so the iron boat leaked very much. As we cannot repair her without pitch,

                  others, having on board valuable articles which might be injured by water, went
                  more cautiously, and did not reach his camp until evening. The men with <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> were occupied in
                  hunting, but without much success. The men are much afflicted with painful felons.
                  William <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> is unable to

                  Lewis' camp with three canoes and three men for the remainder of the baggage, but
                  a wind came up which forced them to camp for the night enroute. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> killed a

                  winds. They had to unload and drain the canoes which prevented them from reaching
                  camp. We eat very much meat; it requires four deer, an elk and a deer, or one
                  buffalo to supply us for twenty-four hours. We reserve our flour and parched meal
                  for later when game might not be so plentiful. The hunters killed three buffalo
                  which were made into pemmican — dried and pounded meat, mixed with fat. The
                  canoes are finished except for putting in some knees. We have to use our nets to

                  onions. Capt. Lewis shot an otter but it sank to the bottom. The water is so clear
                  that he dove in and retrieved it. As the canoes had taken different routes through
                  the islands, it was some time before we all gathered at dinner time. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> went back a mile for a

                  that we select the correct fork to ascend. Each fork seems to carry the same
                  amount of water, so to call any one of them the "Missouri" would be giving a
                  preference not warranted. The hunters returned at evening with six deer, three
                  otter and a muskrat.</p>
               <p>At 3 p.m. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> arrived very
                  sick with a high fever. He took five of Dr. Rush's pills. We intend to stay here
                  for several days, so the men put their deer skins in the water to prepare them for
                  dressing tomorrow. We are concerned that we do not find the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> Indians, for the
                  success of our expedition is doubtful if we do not find some Indians with horses.
                  We take consolation in the thought that if the Indians can live here and acquire
                  food to subsist — so can we. It was near here that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was captured by the Minnitaree about five
                  years ago.</p>

                  this morning since the pills have operated. We sent two men up to the southeast
                  fork to examine that river. The captains concur in the impropriety of naming any
                  of the forks the Missouri. Therefore they named the north-west fork — which
                  they mean to ascend — the "<span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>"; the middle-fork the "Madison," and the southeast fork, the
                     "<span class="tei_name">Gallatin</span>." A small bower was
                  erected for the comfort of <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span>, as the leather lodge, when exposed to the sun, is very hot. The

                  party. The hunters killed eight deer and two elk. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> shows no emotion or joy at being again in her
                  native land. If she has enough to eat and a few trinkets to wear, we believe she

                  art. Many of the men are lame and have boils. One man had his arm dislocated, but
                  it was replaced and is well again. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> slipped and fell on the "gunwall" of the canoe. It gives him much
                  pain to work the canoe. Charbonneau has a lame ankle, but likes to walk with <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>.</p>

                  signal by placing their hat on the muzzle of their gun. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> kept on, and after going about five miles
                  discovered an Indian on horseback coming towards them. They were overjoyed at the
                  sight of this stranger. When we had come within a mile, the Indian halted, and
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> did also. He
                  unloosened the blanket from his pack and threw it up in the air by holding two
                  corners, he then spread it on the ground as a signal of friendship. This signal
                  did not seem to have the desired effect on the Indian, for he watched <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and Shields on either
                  flank of Capt. Lewis with suspicion. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> took some presents and walked towards the Indian, calling
                  "tab-ba-bone," which in <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> means "white man."  <a href="#nch1401" id="lnch1401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> saw the
                  predicament, but Shields kept coming on, so when Capt. Lewis was about one hundred
                  paces away, the Indian put the whip to his horse and vanished. We now set out on
                  the track of the horse, hoping by that means it would lead to an Indian camp. We
                  decided that if we followed too closely, the Indians might move off, so we made a
                  camp on an elevated position where we took breakfast. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> prepared a small assortment of
                  trinkets consisting of moccasin awls, beads, paint and a looking glass which was
                  attached to a pole and planted near the fire with the thought that should the
                  Indians return to our camp, they might discover by this token that we were
                  friendly. A rain came up which made the track hard to follow, but we went some
                  five miles where we saw signs of many horses. We camped on a small creek and
                  planted a flag.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> with the canoes found
                  the stream shallow and rapid, which caused the men to be in the water much of the
                  day. The hunters killed three deer and an antelope.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was sent as soon as
                  it was light to try to discover the route the Indian had taken. He followed it to
                  the mountain where it ascended, then he returned to camp. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> determined to follow the base of the
                  mountain with the expectation of finding an Indian road which would lead over the
                  mountains. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was sent
                  to the right, and Shields to the left to look for fresh tracks. After going four
                  miles we found some recent bowers where the Indians had been gathering roots. We
                  fell in with a large Indian road which we followed in and out of the ravines and
                  streams. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> shot at a
                  large animal which might have been a wolverine, but it got away. Four miles
                  further brought us to the distant fountain of the mighty Missouri — in
                  search of which we have spent so many toilsome days and restless nights. Two miles
                  below, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span> had stood astride
                  the little riverlet and had thanked his God that he had lived to have a foot on
                  each side of the heretofore deemed endless Missouri. We proceeded on up the
                  dividing ridge from which we saw immense ranges of high mountains lying to the
                  west. We descended the mountain [by Lemhi Pass] to a creek of cold, clear water
                  [the Lemhi], whose waters find their way to the Columbia. Here we camped for the
                  night.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> had to urge his
                  boatmen on. They are sore from being constantly in the water — but still

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and his little
                  party followed the Indian road in a westerly direction. At about four miles we saw
                  two women, a man and some dogs on an eminence immediately before us. They viewed
                  us with attention, and two of them sat down to await our arrival. The rest of our
                  party halted while <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>
                  walked slowly towards them, making signs of friendship, but the Indians
                  disappeared. We followed the back track which led us along the road we had been
                  traveling. We had not gone but a mile when we came upon three females. One ran
                  off, but the two others saw we were too near them for escape, and they hung their
                  heads as if reconciled to die. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> raised the elderly woman, repeated the word tab-ba- bone, and
                  unbared his arm to show her his skin. The women were instantly reconciled, and he
                  gave them some beads, moccasin awls, paint and pewter looking-glasses. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was directed to tell
                  the woman to call the younger woman lest she alarm the camp. The old woman did so,
                  and the fugitive girl returned. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> also gave her some presents, and painted their tawny faces with
                  vermillion which is emblematic of peace. We informed them by signs that we wished
                  to meet their chiefs. They ran off and we set out on the road along the river. We
                  went two miles and were met by about sixty warriors mounted on excellent horses,
                  who came on at nearly full speed. When they arrived, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> advanced, leaving his gun with our
                  party about fifty paces behind. The women showed the advanced group the presents
                  we had given them. The warriors then advanced and embraced <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> very affectionately. Both parties
                  then came forward, and we were besmeared with their grease. We smoked the pipe,
                  and the principal chief, Ca-me-ah-wait, addressed the warriors. We then moved on
                  to their encampment on the river, four miles from where we had first met them. We
                  explained the objects of our journey, and all the men and women looked at us
                  — the first white people they had ever seen. It was now late, and as we had
                  not tasted food since the evening before, they gave us some cakes made of service
                  and choke berries. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> informed
                  us that this stream, the Lemhi, discharged itself into another [the Salmon] but
                  the latter was confined between inaccessible mountains and canyons and was
                  impossible of travel. They have a great number of horses and we are hopeful of
                  obtaining enough to transport our stores. The Indians danced nearly all night.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and his
                  party set out, having dispatched some hunters ahead. The stream became more rapid
                  and shallow. They passed a creek which they named after <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span> [Blacktailed Deer Creek, near Dillon,
                  Montana]. They killed only one deer, but caught a number of fine trout.</p>

                  in camp, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and
                  Shields borrowed some horses to hunt. About the same time the young warriors set
                  out for the same purpose, but they all returned without success. Having secured
                  the goodwill of <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> informed them through
                     <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>'s sign language,
                  of his main party on the other side of the divide and asked if his warriors would
                  take about thirty horses to transport our goods. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> promised them that they would be
                  well rewarded for their trouble. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> made a long harangue to his warriors, then told <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> that they would

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>'s party made about
                  fourteen miles by water, though in a straight line the distance was only some six
                  miles. The Fields brothers supplied them with five deer and an antelope. In a fit
                  of temper, Charbonneau struck <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, for which <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> awoke early and
                  hungry. We found we had two pounds of flour left. <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> was directed to divide this into two parts. He
                  made one half into a berry pudding — the other half to save until evening.
                  We gave some to the chief. The Indians do not seem anxious to move, and it
                  developed that some of them thought we were in league with their enemies the
                  Pahkies [Blackfeet]. <a href="#nch1402" id="lnch1402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> appealed to the

                  out, and had not gone far when ten or twelve more joined us, and before long it
                  seemed as if the whole village, including some women, were with us. About sunset
                  we reached a place which we called "<span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> Cove." <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> had been sent ahead to kill some

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party set out

                  hunt as neither the Indians nor ourselves had anything to eat. A deer was killed
                  and when the Indians heard of it, they rushed to the kill and were soon devouring
                  the internal parts raw. <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>
                  skinned the deer, and reserved a quarter for us — the balance was given to
                  the chief to be divided among his people. A second deer was killed by <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, and the Indians
                  enacted the same scene. At breakfast time, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> joined us with a third deer. This
                  was shared with the Indians, who were now filled with good humor. Shields killed
                  an antelope as we neared the place where we expected to meet Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s party. We made a halt. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> put his cocked-hat on

                  Indian trinkets on <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>.
                  With Lewis' tanned skin, long hair and leather clothes, he looked like a complete
                  Indian. We rode on two more miles, and were mortified that the canoe party was not
                  there. The Indians were suspicious, and feared an ambush, which required every act
                  of diplomacy on our part to allay their fears and keep them with us. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> is to be sent with a

                  morning, for we are confident that there was not a moment to spare. Capt. Lewis
                  slept fitfully, concerned over the delay of the canoe party and the fickleness of
                  the Indians. We had explained to them that we had a woman of their nation with the
                  party, and also a black man. The Indians were curious and seemed as anxious to see
                  this monster as they were for our merchandise.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and his party

                     Lewis</span> was. Shortly afterwards, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>, Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> arrived. She proved to be the sister of <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>, and their meeting was really affecting
                  — particularly with another woman, "otter woman," who had been taken captive
                  at the same time she had been, but who had escaped and rejoined her people. At
                  noon the canoes arrived and we had the satisfaction of being all together again ;
                  and the prospect of being able to obtain horses so that we could prosecute our
                  journey by land. We unloaded the canoes and arranged the baggage on shore. At
                  evening we called the Indians together and through the medium of <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>, Charbonneau and
                     <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, we communicated the
                  object that had brought us into their country. We made them sensible of their
                  dependence on our government for merchandise, defence and peace. We told them we
                  wanted to go as far as the western ocean as a means to find a more direct route to
                  bring merchandise to them. We told them we needed horses to accomplish this, but
                  would pay them in return. They appeared well pleased. We gave medals to the chiefs
                  and also clothes and presents, and some hominy, which was the first they had ever
                  eaten. <span class="tei_name">York</span> and the sagacity of <span class="tei_name">Scannon</span> were objects of their admiration. The

                  the Indians there with horses for <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> was to bring the rest of the party and baggage to <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> Cove. The spirits
                  of the men are now much elated. We concluded to leave our canoes at this place,

               <p>At daylight three hunters went out. Some of the men are in want of moccasins and
                  leggings, so are dressing skins. Others are making packsaddles, repacking baggage,
                  etc. We made a seine of willow branches and caught a number of fine trout. The
                  hunters returned with two deer. These Indians have a custom of bartering their
                  infant daughters for future marriage. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> had thus been disposed of before her capture, and her
                  proposed husband is living here with this band. He was more than double her age,
                  and has two other wives. He claimed her, but as she had had a child by
                  Charbonneau, now he did not want her. Our men are instructed to give these Indians
                  no cause for jealousy by having connections with their women without the knowledge
                  of their husbands. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> is a man
                  of influence, good sense and of reserved manners, and appears to possess much
                  sincerity. He wears his hair cut close all over his head, in mourning for his
                  deceased relatives. These <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> are now on the eve of their departure for the Missouri to hunt
                  buffalo.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> continued his route
                  and was met by an Indian with two mules. This Indian had the politeness to offer
                  one for <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> to ride, for
                  which a waistcoat was given him for his civility. They value their mules three or
                  four times to that of horses.</p>

               <p>The men are hunting and packing. We selected a spot, unseen by the Indians, to
                  make a cache for the articles we intend to leave here, such as specimens of
                  plants, minerals, seeds, etc. Having no nails or boards, we substituted thongs of
                  raw hide to make packsaddles. We did use some of the planks from the packing
                  cases, and some of the oars, for frames. We put the goods in the leather bags we
                  had made. In this way we made twenty packsaddles. The Indian women have been
                  making and repairing moccasins for the men. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> recovered a trap that he had set
                  last night, two miles below the place he had set it. <span class="tei_name">Silas Goodrich</span> caught several dozens of fine
                  trout.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and his party reached
                  the new camp of the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> over the divide, and they halted for rest. He was given a
                  salmon and some cakes of dried berries. He requested a guide to accompany him down
                  the river. An elderly man was pointed out who consented to undertake the task. The
                  chief drew a map of the country on the ground. He placed a number of heaps of sand
                  on each side of his sketch of the [Salmon] river to represent vast mountains of
                  rock through which that river passed. He described the river as being confined in
                  a narrow channel through steep cliffs –filled with sharp, pointed rocks and
                  foam. He said that none of his nation had ever been down this river beyond these
                  mountains. The old man confirmed the statements just made, but informed us that
                  his nation, the <span class="tei_name">Nez
                     Perces</span>, resided at a twenty-one-days march from here, and that they
                  traded with white people for articles from the sea, cloth, metal, etc. He told us
                  that to get to his relations we would be obliged to climb over steep and rocky
                  mountains for seven days where game was scarce. He also described other routes
                  which appear to be across deserts towards the Gulf of California. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> determined to explore
                  this river to see if the accounts were true, and if so, to take the other mountain
                  route, for he reasoned that if women and children could pass it, then our party
                  could. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> went on,
                  leaving Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> to
                  return to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' camp
                  with the Indians and horses. He left Cruzatte to purchase a horse and then
                  overtake him. An old Indian continued with him.</p>

               <p>This morning is cold and the ink freezes in <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s pens. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was sent to hunt before the Indians
                  arrived. By evening, all the packages, saddles and bags were ready for the march.
                  We deposited some articles in the cache. The hunters returned unsuccessful, so the
                  party was issued pork and corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> resumed his
                  exploration and met some Indians who gave him boiled and dried salmon. They take
                  them in weirs and with gigs. He sent <span class="tei_name">John
                     Collins</span> and an Indian in search of Cruzatte who had not yet joined us.
                  An Indian presented us with <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>'s tomahawk which had been lost or stolen at the Indian camp.
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> was joined this
                  evening by <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and Cruzatte who
                  brought five fresh salmon given them by Indians. He is much pleased with the
                  intelligent, friendly old guide. In justice to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>, who was the first white man to see
                  this [Salmon] river at the time when he was looking for Indians, we named it,

               <p>A couple of men finished covering the cache which we could not do last night in
                  the dark. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> returned
                  with a fawn and some Indian plunder. While hunting, he had come across some
                  Indians. While talking with them, they took his gun and fled on their horses.
                  After trying to recover his gun, he decided to bring their baggage to camp. It
                  mostly consists of roots, of which <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> had samples prepared to make notes of. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> is employed making leather shirts
                  and overalls.</p>
               <p>At 11 a.m., Charbonneau, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>,
                     <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> and about fifty men,
                  women and children arrived at Lewis' camp. The Indians camped near us. Having no
                  meat, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> prepared
                  beans and corn for them to eat. We gave <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> some dried squashes which we had boiled. He said it was the
                  best thing he had ever tasted — except sugar — a small lump of which
                  his sister, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, had given him.
                  In the evening the men built a brush drag, and in two hours they caught 528 very
                  good fish — mostly trout. We gave most of the fish to the Indians. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> purchased five good
                  horses. The Indians are very orderly and do not disturb our articles they see
                  lying about. They borrow knives, kettles, etc., from our men, but always return
                  them.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> with his guide,
                  examined the north fork of the Salmon, encountering many Indians who were taking
                  salmon from the streams. The country is very rocky and steep, and the river is
                  rapid with stones scattered throughout. The Indian account was not
                  exaggerated.</p>

               <h4>A<span class="smallcaps">UGUST</span> 23.</h4>
               <p>The Indians appear to depend on us for food, so we sent two hunters out on
                  horseback to hunt at a greater distance. Our stock of corn and flour is too low to
                  indulge them with more. We laid up the canoes in a pond, and after taking out the
                  plugs, we weighted them down with stones. We hope by this means to guard them
                  against the effects of high water and the fires which are kindled in the plains by
                  the natives. The Indians went on a hunt and got two mule deer and two common deer.
                  At 3 p.m. the expected party of Indians arrived, but we learned that most of them
                  were on their way to the buffalo country. This causes us some anxiety, for they
                  had promised to assist us over the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> traded for one horse, but the
                  natives are not inclined to part with any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s party proceeded with
                  difficulty in the exceedingly rough country. He followed an Indian track at times
                  and ascended a mountain from which he had a view of the mountains to the west. He
                  was now satisfied of the impracticability of this route, either by land or water,
                  and so informed the old Indian guide. This guide, whom we call "Tobey," drew maps
                  in the sand and by his evident familiarity with the country, Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was convinced that the trail to
                  the north which the guide had indicated, is more practical. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> is unwell. We decided to
                  rejoin Capt. Lewis and party.</p>

               <h4>A<span class="smallcaps">UGUST</span> 24. Capt.</h4>
               <p>Lewis traded for three horses and a mule in exchange for a battle axe, a knife, a
                  handkerchief and a little paint. The Indians told us they have no more horses to
                  trade. We now have nine horses and a mule, and with two hired, make twelve. We had
                  given Charbonneau some articles so that he could trade for a horse for <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> to ride. The Indian squaws
                  loaned us their horses, so we have twenty in all. We loaded the horses and set out
                  at noon. An Indian offered <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> a horse to ride. Peter <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> is very ill with colic. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> gave him peppermint and laudanum,
                  which relieved him. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> had
                  remained with him while he was sick. <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> was mounted on Lewis' horse, and the captain walked. <span class="tei_name">Silas Goodrich</span>, our fisherman,
                  caught several fine trout. We camped near the Cove, making only five miles because
                  of <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span>'s illness.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party retraced
                  their former track. He dispatched John <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> on horseback to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> to notify him of the impossibility of proceeding by way of
                  the Salmon River, and advised him to purchase a horse for each man if possible for
                  the mountain trail. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  slipped and bruised his leg severely on a rock.</p>

                  horses and set out at sunrise. We went about seven miles and halted. The hunters
                  brought in three deer which was divided among the Indians. Charbonneau mentioned
                  that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> had told him that they
                  expected to meet all the Indians tomorrow on their way to the Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> was alarmed by this
                  information, for he learned that <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> had requested his men to meet him to go to the hunting
                  grounds, consequently leaving us and our baggage on the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> therefore called the
                  three chiefs together, smoked the pipe, and asked them if they were men of their
                  word. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> confessed that he had
                  done wrong, but his people were hungry, and this fact had influenced him. He
                  promised to keep his word and assist us. We moved on to the Cove where the creek
                  enters the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span>
                  fired his musket at some ducks, and the bullet rebounded from the water and passed
                  within a few feet of <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party worked their
                  way upstream, subsisting on salmon and berries, and on a beaver which <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> had killed. <span class="tei_name">Richard Windsor</span> is sick, which

                  the horses and set out at sunrise. We soon arrived at the extreme source of the
                  Missouri, and the men drank of the water and consoled themselves at having at
                  length arrived at this long wished for point. We crossed the divide at Lemhi Pass
                  and drank the water of a stream flowing to the Pacific. We halted at a spring to
                  dine and graze our horses, there being fine grass where the spring moistens the
                  soil — all else being dry and parched by the sun. We gave a pint of corn to
                  each Indian who has been helping us transport our baggage, and the same to our
                  men. One of the Indian women paused to give birth to a child, but within the hour
                  she arrived in camp with her newborn babe, apparently as well as ever. We came to
                  the Indian encampment where we found <span class="tei_name">John
                     Colter</span> who had just arrived with a letter from <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>. Upon reading the letter, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> advised <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> that we wished to purchase
                  twenty more horses. We asked for a guide, but were informed that the old man with
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> was better informed
                  of the country than any other man. Matters being arranged, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> ordered the fiddles to be played and

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> sent three men ahead
                  to hunt. As his horses were missing, the old guide and four men went to look for

                     <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, but remained below to

                  thirty horses. We took leave of the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>, who set out for the Missouri, and we at
                  the same time, with Tobey and his four sons–and another Indian, began the

                  perfectly happy to remain with the white people [She probably never saw her people
                  again]. The hunters brought in three deer, so we did not feel the want of
                  provisions. We camped at the place where we found Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and his companion, for there is good grass

                  camped on a large creek that falls in from the west. We determined to rest here

                  satisfy our hunger. He had also killed a crow. At 5 p.m. we arrived at the first
                  Indian lodges. The men searching for the lost horses came in. They had found the
                  horses but think they had been stolen last night.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> met the
                  chief on the river, and they both set out for Lewis' camp. He sent out the
                  hunters, leaving one man to watch the baggage. Enroute back, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the chief met <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> with three deer. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> exchanged horses with Shields, but the
                  horse threw Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> three
                  times, and his hip was hurt. Nevertheless, we reached the village at sunset where
                  we found <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and party
                  encamped [Weippe Prairie]. We cautioned them of the consequences of overeating so
                  soon after their fast. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> had lost three horses — one of which belonged to Tobey. The
                  Indians had stolen from <span class="tei_name">Reuben
                     Field</span>s a shot-pouch, a knife, wipers and a steel and compass. Having no
                  interpreter, we communicated by sign language. <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> drew on a white elk skin a map of the
                  rivers of this country.</p>

               <p>We traded with the Indians for roots, camas bread and dressed elk skins. We make
                  shirts of the skins. The Indians were assembled and we told them where we had come
                  from, and where we wanted to go. We gave them flags and medals and told them we
                  had come to make peace between all tribes. This appeared to satisfy them very
                  much. We gathered our horses and proceeded to the second village two miles
                  distant. Capt. Lewis and two men are very sick this evening and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s hip is painful. The
                  Indian women are busy gathering and drying camas roots which are good and

                  We collected thirty-eight of them and they were branded with an iron we had

                  to be found — and at the same time we missed <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s pipe-tomahawk. We therefore went on
                  without them. We passed ten rapids in descending. The captain's canoe struck a

                  where we could fix the canoe. Tobey and his son, who came over the mountains with

                  than ever. One man was sent to trade for fish, rootbread and dogs. At dark, we
                  found that our old guide, Tobey, and his son had left us, and were seen running
                  back up the river several miles. We could not account for their leaving, unless it
                  was that they were afraid of being cast away in the rapids. Tobey had received no
                  pay, nor hinted of his intentions. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> is recovering rapidly. The Indians here are troublesome,

                  unable to steer the canoe today as he has a fit of the ague. At 11 a.m. we came to
                  a very bad rapid which was full of rocks. We had to take the boats down one at a
                  time. One of them struck a rock and received a hole. We got her safe to shore, and
                  then unloaded and repaired her. The Indians caught some of our oars which had been
                  washed ashore. At 5 p.m. we came to the [Snake] river. A misunderstanding arose

                  of the three other canoes, it was unloaded and pulled off the rock. There was no
                  injury, other than wetting the greater part of the loading. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> was in the canoe with <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>. We reloaded and
                  proceeded on. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> walked
                  around the rapids. We halted on a point at the junction of the Snake and Columbia
                  rivers. There were Indians here and we smoked with them. About two hundred came
                  from their camp, singing and dancing as they came. We smoked with them also. We
                  bought from them seven dogs, and they gave us several fresh salmon and some dried
                  horse meat.</p>

               <p>This morning the captains made lunar observations. The chief of the tribe came
                  down and we purchased some dogs from his people. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and two men went up the Columbia River
                  to the first fork to inspect that place. Hunters were sent out to shoot some
                  prairie-cock — a large fowl found near the river. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> took a vocabulary of these Indians,
                  and also of those Indians who live upstream on the [Yakima] river. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and his men returned at
                  dark. The party is employed in dressing skins, mending clothes and putting their
                  arms in order — the latter always being a matter of attention with us. Many
                  of the natives have sore eyes, perhaps caused by the reflections from the water
                  where they are continually fishing in an open country, hence the eyes have no
                  rest. They are friendly and not beggarly — but they stole an axe from us
                  last night.</p>

               <p>Several heath hens lit near us and the men killed six of them. The captains are
                  busy taking measurements of the rivers and making meridian altitudes. We purchased
                  forty dogs today. The fish offered by the natives are spoiled and very bad. There
                  are thousands of them washed up on the shores. We set off down the Columbia
                  accompanied by the two chiefs. Our Flathead Indians left us as they are unwilling
                  to go any further. The Great Chief drew us a map of the Columbia River above us
                  and of the tribes that live on its waters.</p>

               <p>Several of the chiefs visited us today. We gave them medals and strings of wampum.
                  Peter Cruzatte played the fiddle which pleased and astonished them. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> walked ashore with the
                  two chiefs, and Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>. Upon ascending a cliff, he discovered to the west a high
                  mountain covered with snow. We think it is Mt. St. Helens as laid down on
                  Vancouver's map [It was Mt. Adams]. We saw many lodges, but the natives fled and
                  hid. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> searched one
                  lodge, and upon entering, found thirty-three people, some of whom were crying and
                  wringing their hands. He gave them his hand and distributed a few small presents,
                  which pacified them. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the Fields brothers also used every means to convince
                  these people of our friendly intentions. It seems they were frightened because
                  they had seen <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> kill a
                  crane in the sky, and they therefore thought that we came from the sky. As soon as
                  they saw <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, who was with <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>, they all came out of
                  hiding and assumed new life, as they knew no squaw ever accompanies a war party.
                  We smoked with them, and then dropped down the stream. We landed, and were joined
                  by many natives who brought us some fire wood — which was very acceptable,
                  for none is to be found about. Cruzatte and <span class="tei_name">George Gibson</span> played the violins which delighted
                  them greatly.</p>

                  clothes which they have traded for from the coast tribes. On Memaloose Island we
                  saw a place where the Indians deposit their dead. There was a frame of boards and
                  old canoes sixty feet long and twelve feet wide. There were a great number of
                  human bones covered with mats, fish nets, various kinds of trinkets, etc., heaped
                  with them.</p>

               <p>Having no wood, we could not cook our breakfast. John <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> made some excellent beer from the camas root
                  bread which had become wet and soured from our past accidents. We passed on down
                  until we came to a large [Owyhee] rapid which we halted to examine. All who could
                  not swim walked on shore. After passing this rapid we came to a small river which
                  we named "<span class="tei_name">La Page</span>" [John
                  Day River], after one of our Frenchmen. We came to some natives and purchased from
                  them a little wood to cook our dog meat and fish. The natives all have <span class="tei_name">pierced nose</span>s and do not
                  receive us with the same cordiality as the natives above did. From the last rapid

               <p>We pressed on, and came to a very considerable rapid where an immense body of
                  water was compressed into a narrow channel two hundred yards wide. Two miles above
                  this we had passed a [Des Chutes] river. At the [Celilo] falls we landed and
                  walked down to find the best route for a portage. We took every article except the
                  canoes across the portage where we formed a camp in a suitable position to protect
                  our stores from theft. The Indians with their horses helped us carry the heavy
                  articles. We sent two men to examine the river.</p>

               <p>We took the canoes over the portage with much difficulty. One got loose and was
                  caught by the Indians below, whom we had to pay for for its recovery. Our old
                  chief heard the Indians below say that they intended to kill us. We have our arms
                  in order. As these Indians will not sell us their good fish, we purchased eight
                  dogs for the party to eat. We ex.. changed our small canoe and a hatchet and a few
                  articles, for a large, new Indian canoe built for riding the waves. This place is
                  full of fleas so we are obliged to strip naked in order to brush the pests off.
                  The Indians left us earlier than usual, and our chiefs appeared very uneasy this
                  evening with their fears and suspicions of an intended attack.</p>

               <p>The Indians approached our camp with caution. Our two old chiefs are determined to
                  return home, as their nation is at war with the nations below, and they are afraid
                  of being killed. We persuaded them to stay two nights longer with us with a view
                  of making peace. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>
                  and three men went to study the falls, while <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> set out with the land party. It being
                  impossible to portage the canoes around the boiling rapids, we had to ride the
                  canoes through them. We had confidence in our head waterman, Peter Cruzatte, which
                  was well placed. The Indians who watched from the high banks were astonished. The
                  men who could not swim went on shore carrying the goods, guns, ammunition and
                  papers. We proceeded down the channel and landed at a village of twenty-one wooden
                  houses. Here we found <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> and a chief from below with a large party of men. Cruzatte played
                  the violin, and the men danced, which pleased the Indians. We visited their wood
                  houses, the first we had seen since leaving the Illinois. This presented a good
                  opportunity to hold a council to make peace — which we are satisfied we
                  accomplished. They furnished us with dogs, cranberries and some of their root

               <p>The captains walked down to see the place which the Indians say is the best place
                  for passing through the channel. As there was no portage for the canoes, we
                  decided to run the canoes through the long narrows. As usual, the men who could
                  not swim, walked around, carrying the stores. Our best watermen took the canoes
                  through. We stood by with ropes should there be any difficulty. The first three
                  canoes passed through safe, while the fourth nearly filled with water, and the
                  last one passed through shipping only a little water. We are grateful and pleased
                  that we have passed the worst part of the river. We loaded the canoes and set out,
                  but one of the canoes struck a rock and was in danger of being lost. We came to a
                  village where we met our old chiefs and a party with whom we smoked and gave a
                  medal. The old chiefs parted with us at this place. They had purchased a horse
                  each, and intended to return to their villages on the [Clearwater] river. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> killed a deer and saw
                  much sign of others. We formed a rock fort for defense should the Indians decide
                  to attack us. They are in the habit of collecting a levy from all who pass this
                  part of the Columbia.</p>

               <p>We sent six men to hunt deer and collect rosin to patch the canoes which have
                  become very leaky from being hauled over the rocks. We are drying our stores while
                  the canoes were drawn out and turned over. Many of the articles are spoiled from
                  repeated wetting. We were visited by some chiefs from above the falls who were out
                  hunting at the time we passed over the falls. We gave them medals, paint, knives,
                  etc., and acknowledged them as chiefs. Cruzatte played the violin as they sat
                  around our fire, and <span class="tei_name">York</span> danced for them
                  –which pleased them exceedingly. Our hunters returned with five deer. One of
                  our guards gigged a salmon trout which we thought the most delicious fish we had
                  ever tasted. We dried all our articles and repaired the canoes. The fleas bother
                  us as we do not have a change of clothing. The party amused themselves by dancing
                  at night. This lay-over enabled the captains to take observations and vocabularies
                  of this nation.</p>

                  These chiefs and party continue with us. We treat them well and feed and smoke
                  with them. They were joined by seven others from below who wanted to take
                  liberties with our goods, and after we declined being taken advantage of, they
                  returned down the river in ill humor. Soon the chiefs decided to go home, and we
                  put them across the river. These natives flatten their heads by compressing them

                  purchased five dogs, some dried berries and a white bread made of roots. We laid
                  by because of the high wind, but this wind did not deter the natives at all, as

                  sleeps we shall see the ocean and white people.</p>

               <p>We set out at 8:30 a.m., having dispatched four men in the small canoe to hunt.
                  Later we landed at a large village and were treated very kindly by the natives.
                  They gave us a round root about the size of a hen's egg. They roast them and call
                  them "wappato." Many Indians visit us and have more European trinkets than the
                  natives above. Some Indians arrived and are armed with pistols, war axes and ready
                  sprung bows and arrows. They are a sort of middlemen between the coast tribes and
                  those above. They were assuming and disagreeable. However, we smoked with them and
                  treated them with friendship. They stole a great coat from one of the interpreters
                  which we later found stuffed under the root of a tree. They also stole the
                  pipe-tomahawk of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  — which we never found. We saw crab apples and raspberries. The hunters got
                  two deer and some ducks.</p>

                  We set out at sunrise and the river began to widen out. We dined at an island and
                  the hunters obtained many fowl. We made thirty-two miles today and then camped.

                  overtook some Indians in canoes with articles to sell. We purchased wappato roots,
                  salmon-trout and two beaver skins. They spoke a few words of English and told us
                  that they traded with a man named Mr. Haley. We camped on the south side of the

               <p>We set out early in a fog so thick that we could not see the other side of the
                  river. We passed a village where we bought some fish, wappato roots, three dogs
                  and two otter skins, for which we gave fish-hooks. After remaining an hour and a
                  half, we set out, piloted by an Indian to the main channel of the river. We then
                  passed down to another village where <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> purchased two beaver skins to make a robe, as the one he
                  has is rotten and worthless. We proceeded on twelve miles and encamped near a fine
                  spring under a high hill opposite Pillar Rock. Two Indians accompanied us from the
                  last village and were sent off after we detected them stealing a knife. Our small
                  canoe, which got separated this morning in the fog, joined us this evening. Great
                  joy in camp! We are in view of the ocean which we have been so long anxious to

               <p>We changed our wet clothes, so did not set off until 9 a.m. We went past several
                  islands in the bay which here is five or six miles wide. We coasted along an inlet
                  we call "Shallow Bay" [Gray's Bay]. We avoided an old Indian village for they are
                  usually full of fleas. We took advantage of the returning tide to go to a point on
                  the right, but the waves ran high, and several of the men became sea-sick. We
                  camped on a point and raised our baggage on poles to keep it above the tide. We
                  passed a disagreeable night — the rain never ceased.</p>

                  endanger our canoes. Our camp was under water, and every man was wet.
                  Notwithstanding our disagreeable situation, we must spend another night here, for
                  the waves are too high to proceed. The men are cheerful and anxious to see further

                     <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, some distance below.

                  informed us is at no great distance below. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' object is to find a small bay as

               <p>This morning was cold and fair which gave us an opportunity to dry our bedding and
                  examine the baggage — the greater part of which is wet. We put our goods in

                  p.m. the wind lulled, and we loaded in great haste to set out, passing the point
                  to the sand beach below. <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>
                  and five Indians met us there. He told us that he had met <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> some distance below, and that Lewis
                  had taken <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> with him,
                  and had sent <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> up to meet us.
                  The natives with him are rogues; the night before they had stolen both <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>'s and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s guns. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> arrived just in time, and the

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> told these Indians
                  that if any of their nation stole anything from us that he would have them shot.
                  They understood his meaning very well. As the tide rises here, we concluded to
                  form a camp at the highest place. The evening is fair and the men are comfortable
                  in the camps they have made from some old boards which they found in an abandoned

                  leave our camp. We sent two men to the open plains near the ocean for Sacacome
                  — an article which we, and they, use to mix with our tobacco. The rest of
                  the men are working on the cabins.</p>

               <p>The captains moved into their cabin, though it is still unfinished. Two canoes of
                  Clatsop Indians arrived with mats and bags made of reeds and rushes. We purchased
                  them as well as a panther skin. We gave them some soft and mouldy salmon which
                  they prize very highly. We sent a little pounded fish to Chief <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span> who is sick at his village and could not come

                  laid before the captains a mat and a parcel of roots. Later, he demanded two files
                  for his presents, but we had no files to spare — which displeased him a
                  little. They then offered a woman to us which we declined — which also
                  displeased him. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span>
                  finished a wide slab which he had hewed level for the captains to use as a writing

                  Christmas" and other songs under the captains' windows. The men returned to their

               <p>After breakfast we divided half of our remaining twelve carrots of tobacco among

                  and our dinner consisted of poor elk and a few roots— with no salt to season
                  that. But we are in good health, which we esteem more than all the ardent spirits

                  mark of respect we have to offer on this celebrated day. Our repast, though better

               <p>Our fort being completed, our commanding officers direct that the guard shall
                  consist of one sergeant and three privates, and that the same shall be changed at

                  respectfully commanding the same. It shall be the duty of the sentinel to announce
                  the arrival of Indians to the sergeant of the guard, who shall immediately report
                  the same to the commanding officers. The garrison is charged to treat the natives
                  in a friendly manner, nor are they at any time to abuse or strike them, unless
                  such abuse be first given by the natives. The sergeant of the guard, assisted by
                  Charbonneau, may evict any native who insists on remaining in the rooms or fort
                  — unless they have been invited to remain. It shall be the duty of the guard
                  to keep the key of the meat-house and visit the canoes to see that they are safely
                  secured. All must mount guard but the interpreters and cooks. All are to return
                  tools after use, and in no case are any to be kept out all night. Only <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> is excepted from the

                  was stranded near the salt works. We found that it tasted something like beaver or

                  had a good store of meat, and made three to four quarts of salt a day. They

                  top. Here we met fourteen Indians loaded with blubber. We left the top of the
                  precipice and camped on a small creek, all much fatigued.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> to hunt as meat is scarce in

                  now have to stand guard. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>

                  computing the distances, we went down a steep descent to the beach. We proceeded
                  on some two miles to where the whale was stranded. It was already stripped of its
                  meat and we found only the skeleton of the monster. It measures 105 feet long. We
                  returned to the village where the Tillamooks were boiling the blubber, and we
                  traded our goods for some three hundred pounds of it and four gallons of oil
                  — which we prize highly. While smoking with the Indians there was an outcry,
                  and the guide informed us that someone had been killed. On examination, we found
                  that <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span> was absent. Sgt.
                     <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and four men were
                  dispatched, and they met <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> on a
                  creek. <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> had been friendly with
                  a native man, but now a native informed him that the man intended to assassinate
                  him for the sake of the few articles on his person. The squaw had given the alarm.
                  The Indian ran off before <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>
                  knew what had occasioned the alarm. We returned to the salt makers' camp where we

                     <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> brought in an

                  twenty-five of his nation with hats to trade. We gave them food and tobacco, and
                  to the chief a medal with which he was much gratified. In the evening we desired
                  them to depart as is our custom, for we never permit such numbers to be in the
                  fort all night. We must be on guard at all times and never place ourselves at the

                  Two of these had been made to measure for the captains, and they fit very well. We

                  fore-sight of his gun and shot many times, killing only the four. As the elk were
                  lying at some distance apart, we sent two details of men out for them. Both
                  parties returned at evening, bringing the flesh of three and the skins of four. We
                  were visited by a chief and his wife, with six women of the tribe, which the old
                  bawd had brought for market. This was the same party who had last November
                  infested so many of our men with venereal disease, from which all are not vet
                  free. We therefore gave the men a particular charge, which they promised to keep.
                     <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> is still weak.
                     <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and five men
                  were sent up to the fishery to purchase a canoe if possible.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and party did not
                  return as expected. Our stock of merchandise is at a low state. Two handkerchiefs
                  would now hold all the small articles we possess. The balance of the stock
                  consists of six blue robes and one of scarlet; <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s one artillerist's uniform coat and
                  hat, five robes made of our large flag, and a few old clothes trimmed with ribbon.
                  On this stock we have to depend for the purchase of horses and sustenance from the
                  Indians — a scant dependence indeed for the distance yet before us. We
                  sealed up some papers and letters and gave them to the Indians to deliver to Mr.
                  Haley, the trader of the ship that visits this coast.</p>

               <p>The women still remain near us. They have set up a camp near our Fort and seem
                  determined to lay close siege on us. The men have preserved their vow of celibacy
                  made to the captains. We have had our canoes prepared for our departure, and shall
                  set out as soon as the weather will permit. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> returned this evening from the
                  Cathlamets with our canoe which Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> had left there, and another which he
                  purchased. For this he gave <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span>' laced uniform coat and nearly a half carrot of tobacco. We still
                  need another canoe, and if the Clatsops will not sell at a price we can afford, we
                  will have to take one of theirs in place of the six elk they stole from us this
                  winter.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was taken sick last
                  night with a pain in his side like a pleurisy. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> bled him. Several of the men are
                  unwell. We directed Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> to prepare the two canoes which <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> had brought. They need to be calked
                  and strengthened with knees. We were visited by <span class="tei_name">Comowool</span> and <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt</span>. We furnished the latter with a list of our names, after
                  which we sent him off with his female band. We have given such a list to several
                  of the natives, as well as posted a copy in our quarters. The object is to inform
                  the civilized world that our party had arrived overland from the United States.
                  Our party is too few to leave any here to return by sea, particularly as we shall
                  divide into three or four parties at some stages of our return journey in order to
                  explore the important objects we have in view. This evening <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> took an otter in his traps and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> killed an elk. Four of
                  the men went over to the coast to take a canoe from the Clatsops, as our
                  interpreter, Charbonneau had suggested. They brought it to the fort and concealed
                  it, as Chief <span class="tei_name">Comowool</span> is here with

               <p>Although we have not fared sumptuously the past winter and spring here at Fort
                  Clatsop, we have lived as comfortably as could be expected. We have accomplished
                  every end we had in view by staying at this place except that of meeting any of
                  the traders who visit this coast. It would have been fortunate if some trader had
                  arrived before our departure, for we would have been able to add to our stock of
                  merchandise and therefore could have made a more comfortable homeward bound
                  journey. We hope the men will be in better health traveling than they have been
                  while stationary. <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> and
                     <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> remain weak. We

                  and Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> were out of
                  order. Fortunately we had taken the precaution to bring duplicate parts, and with
                  the skill of <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span>, they
                  were repaired. Now all are in good order.</p>

               <p>As we could not set out because of the weather, we sent Shields and <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> to hunt. They returned
                  unsuccessful, so we have not more than one day's provisions on hand. We directed
                     <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the two
                  Fields brothers to set out tomorrow early to endeavor to provide us with some

                  fish and a dog for our sick men. We presented to <span class="tei_name">Comowool</span> our Fort Clatsop and its furniture, for he has been more kind
                  to us than any other Indian in the vicinity. In the evening they bade us farewell
                  and we did not see them again. All the hunters returned unsuccessful except <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span>, who did not return. We
                  determined to depart tomorrow in any event.</p>

               <p>At 9 a.m. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> arrived, having
                  killed an elk, but at such distance that we could not send for it. We distributed
                  the baggage and directed the canoes to be loaded. At 1 p.m. we bid final adieu to
                  Fort Clatsop. We had not gone more than a mile when we were met by Chief <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt</span> and a party of twenty
                  Chinooks. He brought a canoe for sale, but as we were already supplied, we did not
                  purchase it. By 6 p.m. we had doubled Point William and arrived at a small creek
                  [John Day] where we found our hunters. They had killed two elk one and one-half
                  miles away. We encamped here for the night. We have five canoes; three large ones
                  and two small ones.</p>

               <h4>M<span class="smallcaps">ARCH</span> 24.</h4>
               <p>We sent fourteen men under Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> to bring in the elk. They soon returned. We breakfasted, and
                  then departed at 9:30 a.m., except for Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>' canoe, which was left aground by the tide. In
                  two hours he and his crew were able to set off, and they overtook us at a village
                  where we had halted. <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>
                  and <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> are still weak.
                  The party proceeded on. Enroute among the Seal Islands we mistook our way, which
                  was observed by an Indian, who put us into the correct channel. He claimed the
                  canoe we had taken from the Clatsops as his property, and we compromised by giving
                  him an elk skin with which he was perfectly satisfied. We encamped at an old
                  Indian village on the south side of the Columbia.</p>

               <p>This morning was cold, and the wind and current were against us, so we made slow
                  progress. We landed at noon [near Clifton, Oregon] where we were joined by some
                  Clatsops. Later we crossed over to the north side, and late in the evening we
                  reached a spot fit for a camp. Here we found <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the Fields brothers who had been

               <p>We met a chief of distinction, Wallalle, to whom we gave a medal and invested it
                  with the usual ceremonies. He was grateful and gave us a large sturgeon. We were
                  overtaken by two Indians who had two dogs to trade for tobacco, but we are not
                  disposed to trade this, as we have only three carrots left. Our men appear to
                  suffer from the want of it and are now reduced to substitute the bark of the wild
                  crab apple, which they chew. Our hunters joined us here, having killed three
                  eagles and a large goose. We walked on shore on Fanny's Island, which <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> named in honor of his
                  sister, Frances. We camped on an island [Grimm's] in the evening.</p>

                  sale. At 10 a.m. we stopped at some houses of Indians where we found <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the Fields
                  brothers. They had not returned to our camp last night. These people gave us as
                  much food as we could eat of dried fish, wappato, sturgeon and other roots. We
                  sent <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and Gibson in
                  two small canoes with six hunters ahead to Deer Island in order to kill game by
                  the time we should come up. We made camp this evening at a spot where we had

                  They had killed seven deer and they brought back a remnant of the flesh, for the
                  vultures and eagles had devoured four deer in the course of a few hours. The party
                  killed, and brought in three other deer, a goose, some ducks and a eagle. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> also killed a lynx.
                     <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> informed us that
                  the vultures had dragged a large buck some thirty yards [these vultures must be
                  condors]. The Columbia is now very high, which makes it difficult to ascend.</p>

                  breakfast at its upper end. We were visited by Indians who spread wappato and
                  fish, and then asked presents in return. We exchanged the skins of the deer killed
                  yesterday for twelve dogs and three sea-otter skins. We camped in a small prairie
                  on the north side. Our sick are getting better.</p>

                  Later we were joined by a fleet of canoes who continued with us some miles for the
                  purpose of looking at us. They are friendly, but had taken the precaution of
                  bringing along their war implements. We camped a little before sunset in a

                  make celestial observations and hunt. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> who was sent to below Seal [Washougal] River, informed us

               <p>The Indians who followed us yesterday camped near us last night. The captains
                  asked them questions relative to their country. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> was sent with two men to examine the
                  Quicksand River. He ascended it some six miles and reported that, as the Indians
                  had said, it rises near Mount Hood. This causes us to believe that there must be a
                  larger river which drains this vast area. We have not seen such a river, and the
                  Indians gave us no indication of any such stream. While we were making these
                  inquiries, a number of canoes arrived. These new people told us that they lived up
                  river at the Great Rapids and that there was a scarcity of provisions there and
                  above on the plains, there is no game on which we can subsist. After much
                  deliberation, we decided to remain here until we collect enough meat to last us
                  until we reach the Flathead nation. Our hunters returned from the opposite side,
                  having killed two deer and four elk. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and party were sent to bring in the meat. The rest of the hunters
                  are to hunt on this side.</p>

                     <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> is to go below the [Sandy]
                  river, and four men are to go above. We also sent out three others to hunt on this
                  side. Those who remained in camp are collecting wood and making a scaffold, and
                  are cutting up the meat to dry it. Among our visitors were two young men who
                  reside at the falls of a large river which discharges itself into the Columbia
                  from the south side some miles below us. They drew us a map, and it appeared that
                  this [Multnomah; Willamette] river comes in behind an island. We had passed this
                  island on the opposite side both coming and going, and therefore did not see this
                  river. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> determined to
                  return, and took seven men : <span class="tei_name">John

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> shot the air gun
                  for the natives about camp which much astonished them. As he had only 10 men in
                  camp — the others all being out hunting or with <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> took the precaution to awe and
                  command respect from these Indians.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party stopped at a
                  village with the hope of purchasing wappato. The natives were sulky and refused to
                  sell any. With a portfire match [a sort of slow burning artillery fuze] and his
                  compass and a magnet, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  made a demonstration. The match was placed in the fire which made it burn
                  vehemently and changed the color of the fire. The magnet was used to turn the
                  needle of the compass briskly. This apparent magic astonished and alarmed the
                  Indians who then quickly lay before him some wappato, and begged him to take out
                  the bad fire. At this moment the match burned out and the fire returned to normal
                  — and he put away the compass and magnet. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> then smoked with them and gave them
                  articles in exchange for the wappato — and went on. The party entered the
                  Multnomah and camped on the stream. They discovered a high mountain south of Mount
                  Hood which they had not seen before, and named it Mount <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>.</p>

               <p>A considerable number of Indians crowded about <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' camp. They all confirm the report
                  of scarcity of food above. This morning <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span>, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and himself, killed four elk. As the party was weak, and
                  some thirty-seven Indians were about, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> thought it best to send a few men to the other side of the
                  river and dry the meat there. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and two men returned with <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> for that purpose. His hunters were ordered to continue

                  intelligent Indian who drew a sketch of the courses of the river and the island
                  which guards it. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>

                  elk he had dried. At 1 p.m. they returned, but the meat had been so poorly dried

                  Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> returned with <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>, and brought the three cubs. We exchanged

                  at 9 a.m. and went along the north shore to near the place where we had camped on
                  November 3rd. We met with our hunters previously sent up. They had killed three
                  elk this morning and wounded two others which they expect to get. We therefore
                  determined to camp here in order to dry the meat. We sent out a search party and
                  employed others in building scaffolds and collecting firewood. The search party
                  returned in the evening with five elk. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> found the two wounded ones and killed
                  them. <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s killed a bird

                  got a pheasant, and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span>
                  killed a condor. Our supply of elk, in addition to the roots and dogs we can

               <p>We reloaded our canoes and set out at 7 a.m., and proceeded to pick up the Fields
                  brothers. They had not killed any game. We did not stop, but continued to the
                  village located on the north side about a mile below Beacon Rock. Here we halted
                  and took breakfast. <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span>
                  observed the tomahawk in one of the lodges which had been stolen from Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on the 4th of November last.
                  The natives attempted to wrest the tomahawk from <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, but he retained it and thus retook our

                  and a few wappato. At 2 p.m. we set out and arrived at the first rapid. We found a
                  good harbor and encamped. We saw deer sign, so sent <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> to hunt in the morning while the canoes were
                  towed above the rapids. <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s

                  in bringing their canoe up the rapid. Above, the current is so strong that it
                  required five oars to make progress. We breakfasted at a village. Here they had a
                  sheep-skin. The head and horns had been formed into a cap which was worn as a
                  highly prized ornament. We obtained the cap for a knife, and gave two elk skins
                  for the sheep skin. <a href="#nch2102" id="lnch2102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> At 10 a.m. we were joined by Sgt.

                  arrived at the portage where we landed, and conveyed our baggage to the top of a

               <p>It rained all night, and our tents and skins which covered the men were wet. Our
                  portage around the Cascades is 2800 yards long on a narrow, rough and slippery
                  road. The duty of getting the canoes above the rapids was delegated to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>, who took all but <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>, who is so weak as to be
                  unable to walk, and three others lamed by various accidents, and one other to cook
                  for the party. A few men were absolutely necessary to guard our baggage from the
                  thieving Indians who crowded our camp in considerable numbers. These people are
                  the greatest scoundrels we have met with. One had the insolence to cast stones at
                  our men as they were walking on the portage road.</p>
               <p> By evening, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> took four
                  of the canoes above the rapids. They were much damaged by being driven against the
                  rocks despite every precaution we took. The river appears to be some twenty-five
                  feet higher than when we descended it last fall. On the return of our party in the
                  evening from the head of the rapids, our men met several natives on the road. John
                  Shields who has delayed to purchase a dog and was some distance behind, was
                  accosted by two Indians who attempted to take the dog from him and pushed him out
                  of the road. Shields, having no other weapon, pulled his knife, and the Indians
                  fled through the woods. These Indians stole <span class="tei_name">Scannon</span>, <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                  Lewis</span>' dog. Three men were sent in pursuit of the thieves, who discovered
                  the party, and left the dog and fled. They also stole an axe, but John <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> detected the act and
                  wrested it from them. We informed them by signs that if they made any further
                  attempts, or insulted our men, that we would put them to death. We are concerned
                  for future travelers; no other consideration but our numbers protected us. We kept
                  on constant guard, and our men are disposed to kill a few of them. This evening we
                  sent <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the Fields
                  brothers a few miles up the river to the entrance of Cruzatte's River [Wind River]
                  to hunt until our arrival.</p>

               <p>Though it rained all of last night and this morning, we determined to haul the
                  remaining canoe beyond the rapids. At one place the current sets with great
                  velocity against a projecting rock, and in hauling the canoe around this point the
                  current turned her side to the stream, and despite the utmost exertions, we were
                  compelled to loose the cord, so both canoe and cord went adrift into the stream.
                  After breakfast all hands were employed in taking the baggage over the portage.
                  The men who had short rifles carried them to protect our baggage from robbery or
                  injury. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and some
                  other men were employed the greater part of the day in repairing and calking the

                  cargo among the remaining canoes. This being done we set out at 8 a.m. We found

                  additional canoes, four paddles and three dogs. He gave them two buffalo robes,
                  four elk skins and some deer skins in exchange. His party crossed to the south

                  unwilling to barter, so we gathered up our merchandise and at 8 a.m. we set out.
                  The captains halted a few minutes at the Sepulcher Rock to examine the deposits of
                  dead at that place. We then proceeded along the north shore and arrived at another
                  village where we tried to purchase horses. All we could get were two dogs. We
                  continued on until evening when we camped on a [Mill] creek, where we had camped
                  for two days last fall. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and some others went to hunt and brought back a deer.</p>

                  detailed to make packsaddles. Capt. Lewis collected specimens of the plants the

                  having killed two deer, which were brought in later by a party sent for them. One
                  of Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s men came over to
                  inform <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> that he had
                  obtained no horses as yet, but had the promise of some at the village above the

                  tomorrow to the Skilloot village where we intend to meet tomorrow. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> dispatched George
                     <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> with a note to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> advising him to double
                  the price, so that five horses could be obtained. All of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' hunters returned in the evening.
                     <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> killed a deer which

               <p>Meanwhile, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party
                  took a position near the village and laid out the articles he had for trade. He
                  obtained a sketch of the upper Columbia and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s rivers. The Indians sold him three horses.
                  He also purchased three dogs and some onions to feed his party, and some roots for

                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> loaded his canoes
                  and set off for the opposite side — transporting a few Indians who lived
                  there. The party had to portage a short rapid and they drew up the canoes by the
                  cord, assisted by setting poles. From here we proceeded to the basin below the
                  Long Narrows and landed. After unloading the canoes and arranging camp, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> walked to the Skilloot
                  village and joined <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>. He
                  had procured four horses for which a high price had to be paid — at least
                  double that we had given the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>. These were taken by Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' camp. At 3 p.m. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> with three men arrived from the
                  camp below with elk skins and a few articles including Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s two coats, and four buffalo robes belonging
                  to the men. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> dressed
                  the sores of the principal chief and left some medicine to cure his eyes. He also
                  doctored the chief's wife by rubbing some camphor on her temples and back, and she
                  felt restored. This presented a favorable opportunity to trade with the chief, and
                  he sold us two horses. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> obtained a horse in exchange for a large kettle. We determined to
                  make the portage to the head of the Long Narrows with our baggage and five small
                  canoes. We could not take the two large ones any further, and therefore cut them
                  up for fuel—much to the chagrin of the natives who would give us absolutely
                  nothing for them, as they expected to get them free. In the evening the captains
                  returned to the camp at the basin, and left <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Werner</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>
                  with the merchandise at the upper village at the request of the natives, who
                  promised to give us horses for it in the morning. Many natives resort here for
                  trade, most of whom are troubled with sore eyes, and the older men are nearly all
                  blind.</p>

               <h4>A<span class="smallcaps">PRIL</span> 19.</h4>
               <p>This morning we had our small canoes drawn from the water, and all hands are
                  employed in transporting our baggage on the backs of our four horses. We
                  accomplished this labor by 3 p.m. and established our camp above the Skilloot
                  village. We obtained four more horses today — trading two of our kettles. We
                  now have only one small kettle to a mess of eight men. In the evening <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> set out with Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, Cruzatte and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> to the village at the Grand Falls
                  in order to trade for horses. The people here are faithless in their contracts,
                  for they frequently trade, and then later demand more, or revoke the exchange.
                  They have pilfered several small articles from us this evening. We directed that
                  the horses be hobbled and grazed at a little distance from our camp under the care
                  of our men. <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> was
                  negligent and suffered his horse to ramble off. It was not found when we ordered
                  them up to be picketed. All except one are stallions and were restless all
                  night.</p>

               <h4>A<span class="smallcaps">PRIL</span> 20.</h4>
               <p>This morning we were informed that the natives had stolen six tomahawks and a
                  knife in the course of the night — and some spoons during the day. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> spoke to the chief on
                  the subject — but the property was not restored. The horse which <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> had purchased —
                  and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> had let get away,
                  was gambled off by the Indian who had sold it, and it had been taken by a man of
                  another nation. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>
                  therefore took the goods back from the Indian. During the day two more indifferent
                  horses were bought. We could not obtain any more, so we resolved to go tomorrow
                  with those we had, and convey the balance of the baggage in two canoes. We
                  therefore had a load made up for seven horses, reserving one for <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> to ride, as he is unable
                  to walk. We bartered two canoes, elk skins and an old piece of iron for beads. As
                  they would not give anything for one canoe, we cut it up for fuel. We hobbled and
                  picketed the horses within the limits of our camp and ordered the Indians away. We
                  informed them that if they attempted to steal anything that we would beat them
                  severely. They went off in a bad humor; we examined our arms and were on
                  guard.</p>

               <p>Notwithstanding all our precautions, one of our hobbled horses had broken his line
                  and had gone off. We sent several men to search for him—but to return by 10
                  a.m. The Indians stole another tomahawk and the iron socket of a canoe pole. We
                  gave the Indian who had taken the last article several severe blows and had the
                  men kick him out of our camp. This is the first act of the kind on our entire
                  expedition, but we had to do it. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> threatened to shoot any of them who stole, and told them that we
                  were not afraid of them, and that we had it in our power to kill them all and set
                  their houses afire, but it was our wish to treat them with kindness provided they
                  let our property alone. The chiefs who were present hung their heads, but said
                  nothing. At 9 a.m. <span class="tei_name">Richard
                     Windsor</span> returned with the lost horse and the other searchers returned
                  also. The Indian who promised to guide us to the Flathead nation produced two
                  horses, one of which he politely permitted <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> to pack. We left at 10 a.m., having
                  nine horses packed—with another one which <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> rode. At 1 p.m. we arrived at the
                  village where we found <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                  Clark</span>. He had been unable to purchase any more horses. We found the man who
                  had won the horse, and he produced another in its stead rather than give back the
                  large kettle and knife we had traded for the horse. We continued on, made the
                  portage with Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> in our canoes, and went into camp a little below the [Des Chutes]
                  river. We bought some dogs and purchased another poor horse, and took the
                  precaution of picketing and hobbling the horses near our camp. </p>

               <h4>A<span class="smallcaps">PRIL</span> 22.</h4>
               <p>Last night two of our horses broke loose, but they were recovered early. At 7 a.m.
                  we set out, having previously sent our small canoe with <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Potts</span>. Soon after we left, Charbonneau's horse threw his load, and
                  taking fright at the saddle and robe which adhered, ran down to the village, where
                  the saddle and robe were disengaged. An Indian hid the robe in his lodge. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> sent the guide and one
                  man to assist Charbonneau to retake the horse, which he did. They found the
                  packsaddle, but the Indian denied seeing the robe. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> on to ask <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> to halt, and sent some men back to
                  assist us to make the Indians either return the robe or we would burn his house.
                  Just as <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and party
                  reached the village, <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> met him with the robe which he had found in the lodge hidden
                  behind some trappings. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> now rejoined <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span> and party. The captains decided to divide the men afoot, and to
                  march alternately with them each day—one captain in front, and the other at
                  the rear. Thus we proceeded through open country for eight miles when we observed
                  our canoes passing on the opposite shore. The wind being too high for them to
                  cross over, they continued on. We halted to graze the horses and dined on some
                  dogs we had purchased. Here we bought another horse. We went on four miles and
                  camped near a village [near John Day's River]. Charbonneau purchased a horse this
                  evening. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> passed us in their canoe, but Sgt.
                     <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s joined us.</p>

               <p>Charbonneau's two horses got away as he had not secured them to pickets as
                  directed. We sent <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s and
                     <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> to assist
                  Charbonneau in finding them. One was found at no great distance, but the other was
                  given up as lost. At 8 a.m. <span class="tei_name">Reuben
                     Field</span>s and Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>
                  preceded us in their canoe. During our delay for <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> and Charbonneau, we made two
                  packsaddles. We continued our march for twelve miles to a village near the rock
                  rapid. The people here are friendly and sold us four dogs for pewter buttons we
                  had made, and some old pieces of iron and brass. This evening Cruzatte played the
                  violin and the men danced. The canoe parties camped near us.</p>

               <p>We were up early and sent the men in search of the horses. All were found except
                     <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>'s, which was brought back
                  by a hired Indian about 1 p.m. Meanwhile, we made four packsaddles and purchased
                  three horses, and hired three others of the <span class="tei_name">Chopunnish</span> man who accompanies us with his
                  family and horses. Having enough horses for all to travel by land, we sold our
                  canoes for six fathoms of white beads, and loaded up and departed at 2 p.m. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> had to threaten to
                  break up the canoes before the Indians would trade, as they had expected to get
                  them for nothing. Many of our party complain of sore feet caused by the rough
                  stones —having been so long on the soft sand at Fort Clatsop. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' left ankle gives him
                  much pain, but after bathing it in cold water he was relieved. We dined on two
                  dogs and some root bread. We directed that our new horses be picketed, and the
                  others be hobbled, and a strong guard kept.</p>

               <p>We collected our horses and set out at 9 a.m., and proceeded on eleven miles to a
                  village where we purchased five dogs and some wood — then took dinner. We
                  tried to barter for more horses but were unsuccessful. Most of the Indians' horses
                  have sore backs, but are otherwise generally in good order. We set out and went
                  nine miles, where we found some willows which would answer for fuel, and made
                  camp. Enroute, one of the horses we had hired of the Flathead guide, was taken
                  from <span class="tei_name">Hugh Hall</span>, whom <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> had directed to ride.
                  After making camp we traded for two horses which the captains intend to ride, as
                  they have been walking in order to permit the sick to ride. We now have a

               <p>Charbonneau's horse strayed again and we were detained until 9 a.m. before we
                  could set out. Our dinner consisted of only dried elk, which is all we have. We
                  were met by the chief of the Wallawallas and we went to his village where we were
                  treated very kindly. <span class="tei_name">Yellept</span>, the
                  chief, harangued his people in our favor for food, and they soon brought us ample,
                  which was most welcome, for we have been on short rations for two days. These
                  people told us of a good road to the [Clearwater] river, said to be level, with
                  game and good water and grass — and eighty miles shorter. We concluded to
                  take this road and to cross our horses over the Columbia River in the morning.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Yellept</span> brought a very elegant white
                  horse and presented him to <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span>, signifying that he wished to have a kettle. Being informed we had
                  already disposed with every kettle we could possibly spare, Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gave him his sword, some balls
                  and powder with which he was perfectly satisfied. It was necessary to lay in a
                  stock of provisions, so we entrusted <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> to purchase as many fat dogs as he could. He got ten. The chief
                  loaned us some canoes by which means we swam our horses over the river and hobbled
                  them there. Here was found a <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> woman prisoner, so with <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> to interpret, we conversed with the Wallawallas for several
                  hours. Thus they understood us and the objects of our journey. They had many sick
                  among them and we administered medical aid much to the gratification of these poor
                  wretches. We gave them some eye-water which will render more beneficial service to
                  them than any article we have in our power to bestow. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> put in splints and bandaged the arm of
                  a man who needed care — for the arm was broken and was hanging loose. We
                  camped this night with these friendly people. We played the violin and danced for
                  them. Nine-tenths of them had never seen a white man before, and they seem to have
                  a sincere wish to know us, and be at peace.</p>

                  but the greater part have sore backs. The Indians in general are cruel masters;
                  they ride very hard, and their saddles are so poorly constructed as to wound and

                  We rewarded him with a firesteel for his honesty. We camped near the place where
                  we had built our canoes last October. We saw the tracks of deer, so we determined
                  to remain here until noon tomorrow in order to hunt. The Indians inform us that
                  the snow is deep in the mountains before us, and that we shall not be able to pass
                  them until the next full moon — or about June 1st, or perhaps later. This is

                  received coolly by <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>
                  which was unaccountable to us. The chiefs argued some twenty minutes, so to
                  relieve our horses of their burdens, we went to the first water and made camp. We
                  had been informed that the natives had discovered the deposit of our saddles and
                  had taken them, and that our former herd of horses were now widely scattered.

                  young men brought back twentyone of our horses. The greater part were in fine

                  on the bank of a creek where we should camp. We stated our situation in regard to
                  provisions, and the natives gave us some dried salmon and root bread. We told them
                  our men were not used to living on roots for they made them sick. We proposed
                  exchanging one of our poor horses for a young, fat one. The chief told us that
                  they had an abundance of young horses, and that if we wished to eat them, we would
                  be furnished with as many as we wanted. Accordingly, they soon produced two, one
                  of which we killed—saving the other for later. This was the greatest act of
                  hospitality we have witnessed from any nation. We smoked with our Indian friends
                  and gave the chiefs medals. The chief had a large leather tent erected for the
                  captains and invited them to make it their home for so long as we remain with
                  them. As these people have been so liberal, we ordered our men not to crowd the
                  natives' lodges in search for food, as hunger has compelled them to do at some
                  lodges we have passed. We invited the principal men to the tent and spent the
                  evening in explaining who we were, where we wanted to go, the objects of this
                  journey and answering their inquiries. After this council, the Indians stayed with

                  through our interpreters, made ourselves understood, though the translations had
                  to pass through French, Minnitaree, <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Chopunnish</span> languages. This was tedious, and took
                  half a day, but they were highly pleased. We showed them the spy-glass, compass,
                  watch, air-gun and other articles which proved novel to them. A young man
                  presented us with a fine mare and colt. He said our words had opened his ears and

               <p>This morning a great number of Indians collected before Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> who is their favorite physician. He began to
                  administer to at least fifty applicants. The chiefs held a council among
                  themselves in regard to what we had told them yesterday. After haranguing the
                  village, they came to us, and two of their men presented <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> with a fine horse. It was agreed
                  that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> would attend the
                  sick while <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> would
                  hear the answer of the chiefs. They said our words were good regarding peace among
                  the tribes, and they would try to follow it. We gave a vial of eye-water to <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> for the use of his people. We
                  gave <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> a gun, a hundred
                  balls and two pounds of powder as part payment for caring for our horses this past
                  winter as we had promised. We also promised to give him the same quantity of
                  powder and lead when we receive the balance of our horses. Three more were brought
                  in, which leaves only six missing — as old Tobey and his son each took one
                  of ours when they returned to their <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> nation last fall.</p>
               <p>We informed the Indians of our wish to form a camp at some proper place where we
                  could fish, hunt and graze our horses until the snows on the mountains would
                  permit us to pass. They recommended a place a few miles distant. As we will need
                  guides to take us on the different routes we intend to take from Traveler's Rest
                  [on the Bitterroot], and as <span class="tei_name">Twisted
                     Hair</span> has several grown sons who are familiar with the different routes,
                  we invited him to move his family and live with us while we remain here. He was
                  grateful with this expression of confidence and promised to do so. <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span>, the chief, gave <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> a horse, and several
                  of our men swapped horses with the natives for better ones.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> was busy with his
                  patients. At 11 a.m. we collected our sixty horses and set out for the river
                  escorted by a number of natives. We followed [Lawyer's] creek down to an extensive
                  open bottom of the Kooskooske [Clearwater] River and halted at the place appointed
                  to meet the canoe which was to take us across. As the canoe did not arrive until
                  after sunset, we remained here all night.</p>

               <p>We dispatched <span class="tei_name">Collins</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> to hunt. At 10 a.m. we had our
                  baggage and horses across the river. We reloaded after breakfast and went to the
                  place selected for a permanent camp [near present Kamish, Idaho]. This is a very
                  eligible spot near good hunting grounds and excellent pasture. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> killed two bear, and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> and Peter <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> were sent with him to bring back the meat,
                  which they did this evening. We gave the Indians some of the bear meat, which was
                  a great treat to them. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> returned late and told us he had killed a bear and two cubs. He
                  brought some large pheasants. <span class="tei_name">George
                     Shannon</span> also returned with a few pheasants. Our seven stallions are so
                  troublesome that we tried unsuccessfully to exchange them. Therefore, assisted by
                  a native, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> began to
                  castrate them.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s while searching for
                  his horse, saw a Iarge bear near camp, and several men went in pursuit. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> went out to establish a
                  hunting camp, and <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> and Hall
                  went with them to bring in the three bears <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> had killed. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and Cruzatte went up the river to
                  hunt. <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span>, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s and Alex <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> hunted in the hills. In
                  the evening they returned with a few pheasants. At 11 a.m. the men returned with
                  the three bears <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>
                  had killed. <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span>, Joseph Fields

                  are afflicted with the colic which we attribute to the diet of roots. We had all
                  our horses driven together near our camp so that they can get accustomed to each
                  other. We intend to do this each day. Our party made more comfortable quarters of
                  willow poles and grass, so they are secure from sun and rain. The captains sleep
                  under an old sail, and have a bower to do their writing under.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>'s horse left his
                  camp last night and was brought to us by an Indian. The sick men are better today.
                     <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> gathered a quantity of
                  fennel roots which we found very agreeable. We also use onions which we find are
                  an antidote for the wind-forming effects of the roots. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and Cruzatte returned with a deer. A
                  little after dark <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and
                     <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> returned with a

                  have not yet come back. <span class="tei_name">John
                     Shields</span> went hunting. We direct that our horses be driven up at noon
                  each day. We ate two of our unruly stallions who did not survive after <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>'s method of
                  castration. The Indians' method was satisfactory.</p>

                  — each killing one. As these bears are very ferocious, we have directed that
                  at least two hunters go together. We also ordered that the horses be equally
                  ridden so that no one of them is injured by being constantly used on the hunt. We

                  for use when we cross the mountains. The Indians erected a lodge and a wharf on
                  the op- posite side of the river to be in readiness for the salmon — the
                  arrival of which they are as ardently waiting for as ourselves. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> returned from the hunt
                  very unwell. At a little before dark, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Reuben

                  last fall, which was seen with a band of Indian horses, and is now very wild.
                  About 11 a.m. <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> returned
                  with a party of Indians who wanted medical aid. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> treated them for a variety of ailments,
                  and they went away satisfied. At 5 p.m. Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> returned with about six bushels of cowse roots
                  and some bread made of the same root. The Fields brothers returned

                  towards the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> came
                  in and stayed about two hours. We sent five men to build a canoe for taking fish
                  and crossing the river. The captains' tent is not sufficient to keep off the rain,
                  so we had Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and others
                  build a grass covered shelter for them to sleep under which will be rain-proof.
                  'We divided the trade articles among the party to trade for roots. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> went to the village to procure roots.
                     <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> returned, but <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> stayed all night at the village. We ate
                  the last of our meat, and have a horse ready to kill, as we seem unable to secure
                  enough game. The men have been so accustomed to privations that the want of meat
                  nor scanty funds excites the least anxiety among them.</p>

Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> went down the river to select a better
                  place to camp, but finding nothing better, we resolved to stay here. We killed a

                  [Baptiste], <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>'s child, is
                  cutting teeth and is very ill. His jaw and neck are very much swollen. We gave him
                  a dose of cream-of-tartar and applied a poultice of boiled onions as warm as he
                  could bear it. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>

                  suggested that we try an Indian sweat-bath. Shields sank a circular hole four feet
                  deep and three feet in diameter and built a large fire in it as a sweat-bath for
                     <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>. The fire was
                  taken out, a seat placed inside, and the hole was covered with hoops of willow
                  branches. Blankets were secured over the hoops on all sides. He was given a vessel
                  of water to sprinkle on the hot walls and bottom to create steam. After twenty
                  minutes, he was plunged twice in cold water, and then returned to the hole for
                  three quarters of an hour longer. Afterwards he was taken out and covered with
                  blankets so that he might cool off grad- ually. While in the hole he drank
                  copiously of strong horse-mint tea. We continue to burn out the canoe. Most of the
                  men went to the village and brought back a considerable supply of roots. The

                  lost the use of his limbs, so we suggested a sweat-bath in the same manner as

                  showed him the horse-mint plant we had used for tea. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> and Cruzatte hunted towards the

                  <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s went in search of the
                  horse the Indians had given us to kill, as we are out of meat. At 10 a.m. he
                  returned with the horse and it was soon butchered. Our Indian guests told us to
                  take any of their horse herd whenever we wished — a piece of liberality not
                  expected from even our own countrymen. Sgt. Piryor and party set out for the new
                  village. In the evening he, with <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> and Shields, returned with a good store of roots and bread. The
                  others, Charbonneau, <span class="tei_name">La
                     Page</span> and <span class="tei_name">York</span>, remained at the
                  village. We sent Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> and <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> to Lewis' [Snake] River for salmon. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> Cruzatte and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> returned with five
                  deer. <span class="tei_name">Pomp</span> is much better, though
                  we fear the swelling might leave an ugly scar below his ear. The Indians are
                  anxious to have the lame chief sweated under our supervision and requested that we
                  make a second attempt. The hole was enlarged so that the man's father could
                  sustain him in the proper position while in the sweat-house. We could not make him
                  sweat as co- piously as we wished. Afterwards he complained of pain and we gave
                  him thirty drops of laudanum which composed him and he rested well.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> was sent to the village
                  of <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span>. He returned in the
                  evening with some root bread and some wild goat's hair which we desire to use for
                  making saddle-pads. The Fields brothers went out to hunt. At noon, Charbonneau,
                     <span class="tei_name">La Page</span> and <span class="tei_name">York</span> returned with four bags of dried roots.
                     <span class="tei_name">Collins</span>, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> returned with eight deer. The lame chief is much better and can

               <p>Once more we have a good store of meat and roots. <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> is recovering very fast. <span class="tei_name">Pomp</span> is better, and the lame chief has
                  the use of his arms and hands. He washed his face today which he has been unable
                  to do for himself for the past twelve months. Our horses are so wild that we need
                  half of the Indians to help catch them. They are dexterous at throwing a rope and
                  taking the horse with a loop about the neck. As we cannot always depend on the
                  natives, we had a strong compound built in order to take them at our pleasure.</p>
               <p>With Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s party, <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> obtained two Spanish mill
                  dollars in exchange for an old razor. We expect the Indians get these dollars from
                  other Indians who live near the Spanish country to the south. Towards eve- ning
                  they arrived on the [Snake] river and were entertained at a native fishery.</p>

                  merchandise to trade, but the current forced the canoe into some trees which sank
                  the boat. <span class="tei_name">John Potts</span>, who can- not
                  swim, had much difficulty in making the shore. They lost three blankets, a
                  blanket-coat and a pittance of trade goods. In our bare state, this loss of
                  clothing is serious, for there are only three men in the whole party who have more
                  than a blanket apiece. We sent Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and a party to raise the canoe, but
                  the depth and strength of the current baffled every attempt. We gave the lame
                  chief a sweat bath today after which he could move his legs and toes. In the
                  evening <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> returned in
                  search of a horse which had left him last night. He informed us that he and his

               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s party on the [Snake]

                  returned from an unfortunate voyage in that they lost their merchandise in the

                  not heard anything from them since they set out for the [Snake] river. We asked

                     <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>, as he and his
                  family have not camped with us. We fear we shall be at a loss to acquire a guide
                  to the headwaters of the Missouri. We are out of trading goods, so we created a
                  new fund by cutting off the buttons from our clothes and by preparing eye- water.
                  We put the eye-water in phials and small tin boxes which had once contained
                  phosphorous. The lame chief is better.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his men worked their

                  cut off from their coats, and were sent to trade for roots. They returned with

                  horses in good order. Our men run foot races with the Indians. One of them proved

                  hunters are get- ting rather soft and slothful. After dark, Cruzatte played the

                  grass. We have traveled twenty-eight miles without relieving the horses of their

                  find, for our bear's oil was exhausted and we were reduced to roots without salt.
                  At noon we halted to graze the horses. After we had started on again, we found

                  nearest approach to the Three Forks of the Missouri. On the Yellowstone, he will
                  build a canoe and descend the Yellowstone to its junction with the Mis- souri,
                  leaving Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> with the horses to go by land with them to
                  the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Nation.</p>
               <p>These arrangements being made, the party was informed, and they pre- pared
                  themselves accordingly. Our hunters meanwhile had killed thirteen deer in fine
                  order. We had the venison sliced and exposed on poles to the sun to dry. As <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> had burst his gun near its
                  muzzle a few days since, Shields had cut the end off. Now in good order, this was
                  exchanged with the Indian guide for the one he had been given. The Indian was much
                  pleased with the exchange for the gun shoots very well. The guides express the
                  wish to return to their nation, but have agreed to accompany <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> to the Falls of the Missouri.</p>

                  We have dried the greater part of the venison, as we do not expect to find much
                  game on our march. Every man has filled his powder horn, and they have a

                  entered the mountains through a narrow pass and came to the [Blackfoot] river

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> dispatched three

                  noon we dined on a fat saddle of venison and roots in celebration of this July
                  4th. In crossing several creeks our goods got wet. We came to the road we had

                  drying our goods, we left at 4:30 p.m., and crossed the mountains into a valley
                  where we overtook Shields. He had found a good road which will shorten the

                  buffalo. Shields killed a hare. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> informed us she had been in this country before, and that we

                  As we were descending, a violent storm came up, and we formed a solid column to
                  protect us as best we could. After the storm passed, we went on to a small creek
                  where there was timber. We camped and made a large fire to dry ourselves.</p>

                  night. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> caught two

                  but nine. Six men were sent to look for them. They went a great distance but
                  returned by 10 a.m., saying they could not be found. They thought that the Indians
                  may have stolen them during the night, as the very best horses were missing. Sgt.

                  a rich, open valley, and arrived at a boiling spring. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> each put a piece of meat in the boiling
                  springs to cook. After letting the horses graze for an hour, we went on and later
                  camped at some beautiful springs which fall into <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>'s [Grasshopper] Creek. We set a
                  sentinel and hobbled the horses. Meanwhile, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his party found the nine horses traveling on an Indian road.
                  They turned them back and camped at our last night's camp after carefully hobbling

                  and later crossed Dearborn's River —then struck north for the upper waters
                  of the Medicine [Sun] River in order to secure buffalo skins for the expedition,
                  and meat for the three men who are to be left at the caches near the Falls of the
                  Missouri. Reuben Fields killed a buck and an antelope, and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> saw two buffalo at some distance. We
                  are rejoiced at finding ourselves on the plains of the Missouri which abound in

                  creek, and then headed for <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> Cove near the two forks of the Beaverhead River. When we
                  reached there in the evening, the tobacco chewers with the party could hardly take
                  time to unpack their horses before they were off to the cache. Upon opening them,
                  we found every article safe. We gave the tobacco users about two feet of a roll,
                  saving some to send down to the men with <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' party. The canoes were all safe
                  except the largest one which had a large hole in one side and was split in the

                  and found already cooked the piece of venison that <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and Shields had placed there. Having

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> sent his hunters
                  down the Medicine River to hunt elk, and then proceeded with the balance of the
                  party to the White Bear Islands on the Missouri. The buffalo are mating and are
                  keeping up a continual roar. Some of our horses were not acquainted with the
                  buffalo, and are much alarmed with them. We joined the hunters, and they are to
                  kill a supply of buffalo for the men who are to be left at this place. The hunters
                  killed eleven, and we brought in a large quantity of meat. We needed the hides to
                  build some bull-boats, and for gear and shelter. We intend to rest our horses
                  before setting out for the Maria's River journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> sent four of his best
                  hunters [he had: <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>, Shields, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Collins</span>] in two canoes to proceed a few miles ahead of us to hunt. At 8
                  a.m. we overtook one canoe with a deer which <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> had killed. At noon we passed Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>'s horse party near a
                  point of rock called the Beaver's Head. The wind came up, which made our progress
                  slow. At 7 p.m. we camped at the entrance of the Wisdom River. Here we found a
                  bayonet and a canoe we had left here last year. We were joined by <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> who had been sent ahead to hunt.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' party completed
                  the bull-boats by 10 a.m. At this time two of the men who had been sent for the
                  horses returned with only seven of them. The remaining ten of the best horses were
                  not to be found. Two men were sent on horseback to search for them. At noon, <span class="tei_name">Werner</span> returned with three. Sgt.
                     <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> did not return until 3
                  p.m., not having found any. <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                     Fields</span> and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> were now sent to search for them and Fields returned
                  unsuccessful. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>
                  stayed out all night. Meanwhile we transported our baggage to the opposite side of
                  the Missouri in our bull boats which we found answered better than we had
                  expected. We swam our horses over, and camped at sunset.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s party made oars,
                  drew the nails out of the sides of the old canoe, and then set out at 7 a.m. Sgt.
                     <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and his horse
                  party had passed on down. The wind arose and it was difficult to keep the canoes
                  midstream. A sudden puff blew <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span>'s canoe under an overhanging limb, and Howard was caught and
                  injured. At 3 P.M. <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> and
                     <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> overtook us with two
                  deer they had killed. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span>
                  caught two beaver this evening.</p>

                  horses. We opened the cache and found the bearskins entirely destroyed by water as
                  well as <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' collection
                  of plant specimens. The papers and charts of the Missouri fortunately ecaped
                  damage. Most of the medicines were lost beyond recovery. We are concerned about
                     <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> who has not yet
                  returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party proceeded to
                  the entrance of the Madison River where we found Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and party with the horses. His men had
                  killed a deer and a grizzly bear. We drove the horses over to the entrance of the
                     <span class="tei_name">Gallatin</span> River to feed. All
                  the baggage of the land party was taken out of the canoes and then Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> with <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, <span class="tei_name">Collins</span>, Cruzatte, <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span>, <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>,

                  party at our former White Bear Island camp. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> gave them a letter to deliver to <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                  horses and a colt. At 5 p.m. we set out from the Three Forks of the Missouri,
                  proceeded easterly and camped on the banks of the <span class="tei_name">Gallatin</span>. Gibson killed an otter, and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> killed two deer this
                  morning, which was put into the canoes except enough for our supper. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> has been of great service as a
                  pilot. She recommends taking a gap in the mountains [Bozeman Pass] which we shall
                  cross to reach the upper waters of the Yellowstone River.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> had our old wagon
                  wheels dug up for the portage, and we found them in good order. The frame of the
                  iron boat had not suffered materially. We sliced the meat thin and exposed it to
                  the sun to dry, and the roots were pounded into meal for <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' proposed journey. The old cache was
                  too damp to deposit <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                  Lewis</span>' trunks, so he sent them over to the large island and had them put on
                  a high scaffold and covered them with skins so that the canoe party coming down
                  could find them. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>
                  has not returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> sent Shields ahead to
                  hunt. At an early hour we set out with the overland party. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> guided us towards [Bridger Pass] a low plain
                  where we nooned. We overtook Shields who had killed a large, fat buck. After
                  dinner we struck an old buffalo road and followed it to the commencement of the
                  [Bozeman] pass where we encamped. Deer are abundant here — <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, Shields and <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> each got one. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his party proceeded down the
                  Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> killed two beaver.
                  The wind became so high that we could not proceed, so <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> went hunting. Later the wind lulled, so we moved down the river
                  and camped. <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> killed a
                  deer. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> did not join us this

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> sent <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> to the lower end of the portage
                  to learn the condition of the cache and the white pirogue we had left there. The
                  other men are drying meat, dressing skins and preparing for the reception of the
                  canoe party. At 1 p.m. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> — much to our relief — returned without the
                  horses. He is satisfied they were stolen by a party of Indians. We are so happy
                  for his safe return that we have given little thought to the lost seven horses. We
                  have ten horses remaining. We shall leave four with the portage party, and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> will take six on his
                  tour. Therefore, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>
                  will leave three of the men he had intended to take with him : Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> and <span class="tei_name">Werner</span>, and have them stay with the canoe party.
                  Only <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, and the
                  Fields brothers will go with him. <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> had a scrape with a grizzly bear. He broke his musket over the
                  head of the bear and then climbed a willow tree. The bear waited until evening
                  before he left him, and then <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>
                  ventured down, recovered his horse, and returned to camp. These bears are so
                  ferocious that it seems the hand of Providence has been wonderfully in our favor,
                  or some of us would have long since fallen to their ferocity. <span class="tei_name">Scannon</span>, as we are, is tormented by the mosquitoes.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s party set out over
                  the gap, then following a buffalo road, reached the Yellowstone River at 2 p.m.
                  After a delay to give the horses time to feed, and allowing ourselves time to cook
                  and eat dinner, we proceeded down the Yellowstone on a buffalo road. At Shield's
                  River, which we named after our <span class="tei_name">John
                     Shields</span>, we crossed, and then went on to a large bottom where we camped.
                  The horses' feet are sore, but they are otherwise sound and in good spirits. We
                  can find no timber sufficiently large for a canoe which will carry more than three
                  men. Such a small one would not serve our purpose.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s canoe party proceeded
                  very well and overtook <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> who
                  had killed three deer. At 9 a.m. we halted for breakfast and <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> killed a buck while Cruzatte got an
                  antelope. <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span> killed a
                  panther and a deer. In the evening we camped near the Gates of the Mountains.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> got his horses
                  collected by 10 a.m. and set out. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben
                     Field</span>s took the horses to the lower side of the Medicine [Sun] River
                  while <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> went with the baggage
                  down the Missouri to the mouth of the Medicine in a canoe made of buffalo skins.
                  Having all arrived, we saddled the horses and rode down to the forty-seven foot
                  falls, where <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> made a
                  sketch while dinner was being prepared. Afterwards, we rode to the Great Falls

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> on the Yellowstone,
                  sent <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> to hunt. Our
                  horses having wandered, this detained us much later than common. We set out at 9
                  a.m. Soon afterwards, we saw a buffalo and killed it. We saved the flesh and made
                  pads of the skin to put on our horses' sore feet. We went on, and after dinner
                     <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> joined us. The
                  current of the Yellowstone is too rapid for skin-boats, and we cannot find trees
                  large enough to build a large canoe. We therefore continued by horseback down the
                  river. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his canoe
                  party started early. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> got a
                  large beaver. We gathered pitch from pine trees to use on the canoes. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> killed two mountain sheep. We
                  continued, and camped below <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s
                  River.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> with <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> and <span class="tei_name">Werner</span> now joined <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>, <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> and <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>. All continued to repair the wagons so as to
                  have them ready to portage the canoes down beyond the falls when <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s canoe party arrives. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> had left orders with
                  us to wait for him at the mouth of Maria's River until September 1st. He wrote
                  that if his life was preserved he expected to meet us on August 5th. Then we would
                  all drop down to the mouth of the Yellowstone River to await <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s overland party.</p>

                  they found a wounded buffalo which indicated that Indians were about. The three

                  and saved the hides and bones so they could be taken back to the States. A high

                  we think was raised by the [Crow] Indians. We dined on a buck which Shields had
                  killed. After allowing the horses to feed, we set out at 4 p.m., and afterwards
                  camped on an island. Shields killed a buffalo. <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>, in attempting to mount his horse, fell and

                  went with three men to the lower end to examine the pirogue and cache left there.
                  Everything was safe, and they took some tobacco from the cache, then covered it
                  over again and returned to the upper portage camp.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> down the Maria's River
                  and they went as far as the party had ascended the previous year, and then
                  returned at noon. They killed eight deer and two antelope enroute. After dinner,
                  the party went twenty miles up the river and camped.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> rose early and dressed
                     <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s wound. We concluded
                  not to take <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> in a litter,
                  for he found he was as comfortable on a gentle horse as he was lying down. <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> was directed to follow
                  the river and search for a large tree, and also to hunt for wild ginger to make a
                  poultice for <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s wound. He
                  joined us at dinner with neither, but brought two fat bucks. After dinner we went
                  on, but <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s thigh became so
                  painful he could no longer sit on a horse after two and one-half hours riding.
                  Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> with another man
                  waited with <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> under the shade
                  of a tree until a campsite could be found. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and Shields searched for the best site
                  where there were the largest trees, and <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> brought <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> to the camp selected. Charbonneau reported
                  he had seen Indians on the highlands. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s canoe party continued on while his hunters killed four buffalo
                  and a deer. They halted to take the meat aboard, then went on. At 3 p.m. they
                  arrived at the White Bear Island camp where they found Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and his five men. The whole party hauled the
                  boats out of the water to dry in preparation for their portage.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> continued up the
                  Maria's River, noting the side creeks and the soil. They traveled up some

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and Shields — both
                  good judges of timber — to go down the river to see if any larger trees
                  could be found — and to return by noon. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>, Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Hugh Hall</span> were sent to bring the skin and
                  flesh of the elk <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>
                  had killed the evening before. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and Shields returned and informed us that there were no better
                  trees below than those here. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span> then decided to have two canoes made. We have three axes, so the
                  men set about to fell trees. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> dressed some skins t0 make himself some clothes. <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s wound looks better. We shall
                  let the horses rest a few days, after which Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> will take them overland to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> nation. The men are
                  dressing skins to make clothes, for they are nearly naked. Shields killed a deer,
                     <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> a buffalo, and <span class="tei_name">York</span> an elk. We dried most of the buffalo meat.
                  Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his men, now
                  combined with Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>' party, put
                  the tongues in the wagons. Some of the men are dressing skins. Towards evening, we
                  harnessed the horses to the wagons and found that they would drag them along. We
                  are tormented with mosquitoes which abound here.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> set out early and
                  proceeded up the Maria's River. The horses' feet are sore and travel is therefore
                  slow. This afternoon they traveled up the northern [Cut Bank] branch, and
                  determined to pursue it to its most northern point. At evening they camped under a
                  cliff. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s party
                  discovered that 'twenty-four, or half of the horses were missing. <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> and Charbonneau were sent to hunt
                  them. Though they searched both up and down the river, they returned unsuccessful.
                  The men are at work on the canoes and one is nearly finished. <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s wound is beginning to heal. We are
                  apprehensive that Indians have stolen the horses.</p>
               <p>The <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>-<span class="tei_name">Gass</span> party also had trouble with their horses
                  — they lost all of theirs today. We got two canoes started on the portage
                  along with considerable baggage. We use buffalo dung as a smudge to try to ward
                  off the troublesome mosquitoes and flies. We lay with the canoes all night.</p>

                  the Cut Bank fork and continued for twenty-four miles. They nooned to let the
                  horses rest and graze. They then went 12 miles further where a clump of cottonwood
                  trees were found and camped. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> made celestial observations to determine this northern spot. The

                  it was unnecessary to proceed further north. They wounded a buffalo this evening

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> sent Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and Charbonneau in
                  search of the horses and they returned at 3 p.m., having seen neither horses nor
                  tracks of them. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>,
                     <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, Charbonneau and <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> then circled the camp at
                  some distance around in search of tracks. As the plains are hard and dry, no
                  tracks could be found. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>, an excellent tracker, is to search tomorrow to find what route
                  the horses had taken.</p>
               <p> Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> sent out a search party
                  of eight men to look for his four missing horses. Two were found down near the
                  Great Falls. We hitched these up to two canoes and went about five miles when a
                  axle-tree broke. We made another, and started out with the two other canoes, and
                  then made camp. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and five
                  men came up late from hunting the two missing horses. They had three buffalo and

                  suspect there are Indians somewhere on the main branch of the Maria's which they

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> found that during the

                  and <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> went out early to

                  moccasin and a small piece of robe which had the appearance of having been worn
                  only a few hours before. We are satisfied that Indians stole the horses and are
                  lurking about to take the rest. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> informed us that he saw the tracks of the horses leading down
                  the river and judged that they were going very fast. The men finished the canoes,
                  and are now making oars and poles. Shields and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> went after buffalo. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> gave instructions to Sgt.
                     <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, along with a

                  trader who visits the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. He directed that <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> take the remaining horses to the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. Shields and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> killed three buffalo,

               <p>The <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>-<span class="tei_name">Gass</span> party harnessed the horses and set out on the

                  and had to ride in one of the canoes. <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> went ahead to Willow Creek to get some game for us. We arrived
                  at the creek at sunset with the two canoes and considerable baggage and then
                  camped. We got three buffalo.</p>

                  put them across to the east side of the river. At a small creek [Cannon] we met
                     <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> informed us that when the loose horses

                  nearly impossible. At 9 a.m. they set out and took a southerly route over the open
                  plains. After nooning, <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> resolved to make
                  the best of a had situation, and approach the Indians in a friendly manner. He
                  calculated their number to be about thirty men. To run would convince them we were
                  enemies. Besides, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>
                  was separated from us, and not being apprised of the Indians, probably would fall

                  and the Indians asked to smoke with us, but we told them that our man below, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, had the pipe. One of
                  the Indians, with <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s,
                  went to bring in <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>.

                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> proposed that we
                  all go to the creek and camp, which we did, joining <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>. During the evening we had much

                  the first watch and the Indians went to sleep. At 11:30 p.m. he awakened <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s to take the watch and
                  told him that if any Indians left the camp to awaken us all, for he apprehended
                  that they would attempt to steal our horses. This being done, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> fell into a profound sleep and did
                  not wake until a noise awoke him at daylight.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party proceeded
                  down the Yellowstone in the canoes and arrived at the mouth of the Big Horn River.
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> walked up this river
                  some seven miles to explore and take measurements after which they returned to
                  camp. Shields meanwhile had killed two buffalo and three elk.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and the canoe party sent
                     <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> to take the canoes down the rapids to where the
                  pirogue and cache were located. Eight of the men returned to Willow Creek and
                  started to bring down the large canoe over the portage. Cruzatte killed a buffalo.
                  All the canoes were brought down to the end of the portage and we went into camp.
                  We opened the cache and loaded its contents into the white pirogue. Everything was
                  safe and in good condition.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> with <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>, Hall and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, arrived at a creek where
                  there was good grass to graze the horses. Here they remained all night. While
                  asleep, <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> was bitten by
                  a wolf, which also made an attempt to seize <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>. <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> was awakened and shot the wolf.</p>

               <p>At <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' camp the
                  Indians arose and crowded around the fire. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span>, who was on post, had laid his gun down near where <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s was sleeping. One of the
                  Indians slipped behind and took the guns of the Fields brothers unperceived, while
                  two others advanced and seized the guns of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span> seeing this, and looking for his gun,
                  saw an Indian running away with both his and Reuben's guns. Reuben jumped up and
                  both ran after the Indian and overtook him. As they wrested for the guns, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s stabbed the Indian
                  through the heart. The Indian ran a few steps and then dropped dead. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> recovered his gun and
                  the noise awakened <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>,
                  who finding his gun gone, drew his pistol on the Indian running away with it. The
                  Fields brothers came up and were taking aim to fire to shoot the running Indian.
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> ordered them not
                  to fire. By now, the other In- dians were attempting to drive off the horses. Our
                  three men followed so closely that the Indians left twelve of their own horses,
                  but continued to drive off one of our own. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> called out that he would shoot, and
                  as he raised his gun, one of the Indians jumped behind a rock and spoke to
                  another. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> shot him
                  in the belly. He fell, but raised himself enough to fire at <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>. Not having his shot-pouch, Lewis
                  could not reload, so he retired towards camp. Here he was met by <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> — leaving the
                  Fields brothers to pursue the Indians. They returned with four of their horses
                  — losing only one of our own. As there was no time to be lost, we mounted
                  and took a south-east direction. We pushed our horses as hard as they would go.
                  Fortunately the Indian horses were fresh and very good. After going some
                  sixty-five miles, we halted for an hour and a half to refresh the horses. We then
                  went seventeen miles more, killed a buffalo and stopped for two hours. We then
                  rode on until 2 a.m., and at last laid ourselves down to rest, much fatigued.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> set out early and the
                  party proceeded very well. We passed a creek which we named for <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> [Sarpy Creek]. Our
                  men killed four buffalo and we had breakfast. When we passed the Big Horn River we
                  took our last view of the Rocky Mountains in whose tremendous chains we have been
                  since the 1st of May. At sunset we camped, and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> shot an elk. Shields killed a deer and
                  an antelope which our party needs to make clothes.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s party hauled out the
                  white pirogue and repaired it. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>
                  set out with the horses, loaded with meat, for the mouth of Maria's River. At
                  noon, Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, with <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>, <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span>, <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span>, <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span>,

                     <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span> and <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> set out with the white pirogue and five canoes.
                  We went on down the rapid water quickly and made a camp on the south side. <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> killed a buffalo. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> camped on the [<span class="tei_name">Teton</span>] river.</p>
               <p>Up on the Yellowstone, Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> discovered that all of his horses had been stolen during the
                  night by the Indians. He, <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and
                  Hall walked some ten miles without finding them, and then returned to camp. They
                  packed the baggage on their backs and headed for the Yellowstone River which they
                  reached at <span class="tei_name">Pomp</span>ey's Pillar, the big
                  rock which <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> had named.
                  Here <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> killed a buffalo and
                  the men proceeded to build a bull-boat from the hide. They decided to make two
                  bullboats in the event an accident should happen and all would be lost if they
                  were in only one.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the Fields
                  brothers were sore from the long and hard ride yesterday, but they soon resumed
                  riding, for they had reason to believe that the Indians were trying to overtake
                  them. They decided that if they were attacked they would tie the horses together,
                  and they would stand and defend themselves or else sell their lives as dearly as
                  they could. As they neared the Missouri, they heard the reports of rifles, and
                  upon arriving on its banks, they had the unspeakable joy of seeing the canoes with
                  Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>'s party coming down the
                  river. The parties joined, and loaded the baggage that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> had. They threw the saddles in the
                  Missouri and gave the horses a final discharge by setting them free. All embarked
                  in the canoes and proceeded down the river to the principal cache which we
                  proceeded to open. We found it had caved in and much of the contents were injured.
                  The gun-powder, corn flour, pork and salt had sustained little less, but the
                  parched meal was nearly spoiled. Having no time to air the furs and baggage
                  belonging to the men, we loaded them, and slipped down to the point to take on the
                  articles that had been buried in several small caches there. These we found in
                  good order, and recovered everything including the blacksmith's tools, except
                  three traps belonging to <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>. Here Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span>
                  joined us with the horses at 1 p.m. We abandoned the horses and all now went by
                  canoes over to the island at the entrance of Maria's River. Here we launched the
                  large red pirogue, but she was so much decayed, and we had no means to fix her. So
                  we took out the nails and other ironwork, and left our old craft here on the upper
                  Missouri. We now re-embarked in the small white pirogue and the five canoes and
                  descended the Missouri about fifteen miles where we camped, surrounded by game.
                  Howard had killed two deer earlier, so <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the Fields brothers dined well after being on short
                  rations for so long.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> and party set out at
                  daylight and glided down the now calm Yellowstone. We passed many creeks and some
                  cliffs that contained strata of coal. We camped on the upper end of a small
                  island. Shields killed two deer and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> killed an antelope for the hides.
                  Beaver are not abundant at this place, but there are many signs of them.</p>

               <p>The party on the Missouri had a bad night as it rained, and they had no shelter.
                  It continued raining all day so we could not dry ourselves nor our baggage. Joseph
                  and <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s, <span class="tei_name">Collins</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> took two small canoes to hunt. They are to get
                  as many elk as possible for the hides to cover our canoes and furnish us with
                  shelter. The rest of the party set out early, and as the current is strong, we
                  proceeded rapidly down stream. On our way we killed nine big-horn sheep. We
                  preserved the skeletons of two females and one male. The flesh is extremely tender
                  and well flavored. The Missouri is now so muddy we can hardly drink it. <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> got an elk.</p>

                  current, so we went at the rate of about seven miles an hour. We got some more
                  big-horn sheep which we prepared to carry to the United States. At evening we
                  arrived at an island about two miles above <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>'s Island. It rained all day. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> killed a grizzly bear.</p>

                  canoes down by hand for fear of them striking the rocks and becoming split. We
                  have come 694 miles, and this is the worst place on the entire route. At twenty
                  miles we passed .a less dangerous rapid, and as a violent storm approached, we
                  took shelter in an old Indian lodge. After the storm passed, we proceeded to the
                  [Powder] river and camped near by. <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span> is so recovered that he walked out this morning and killed an

                  some old Indian lodges which, with the elk skins, gave us good shelter from the

                  out as usual, and passed through a mountainous country into a land of extensive

                  arrived at the junction of the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers and formed a camp
                  at the same point where we had camped on the 26th of August last year. We unloaded
                  the canoes and exposed every article to dry.</p>

                  early in the rain, hoping to reach the Yellowstone River, distant some sixty-five
                  miles. The current forwarded us and the men applied the oars, so we went at a good
                  rate. We saw a number of buffalo, elk and bear, but did not detain to take any of
                  them. We overtook the Fields brothers who had killed two large silver-grey bears.
                  At 4 p.m. we arrived at the mouth of the Yellowstone and found the remnants of the
                  note left by <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> —
                  informing us of his reasons for dropping further down the Missouri. We found

                  below we saw some meat hanging on a pole. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> examined it, and saw tracks of men which
                  appeared to have been made today. A fire was still burning. He found a Chinook hat
                  which the men recognized as one belonging to <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>. From these signs we concluded that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s party could not be far

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' party set out
                  early as we wished to arrive at the Burnt Hills — the northernmost bend of
                  the Missouri. We needed to take the altitude of this important location. The men
                  plied the oars and we went on rapidly, but we arrived at twenty minutes after
                  noon, and the sun's meridian was therefore lost. We saw some elk, and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and Peter Cruzatte
                  went to hunt them. In going through the thick willows by different routes, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> was in the act of
                  firing, when a bullet struck him through the left thigh about an inch below his
                  hip joint. The ball missed the bone, but cut across his buttocks into the right
                  thigh. As Capt. Lewis was dressed in brown leather, and Cruzatte could not see
                  well, he had shot <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>,
                  mistaking him for an elk. <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Lewis</span> called to Cruzatte several times, but received no answer, and now
                  supposed he may have been shot by an Indian. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> made his way back to the pirogue. He
                  told the men he was shot by an Indian, and that Cruzatte might have fallen into
                  their hands. The party made preparations for an Indian assault. In this state of
                  suspense, he waited until the men had returned with Cruzatte, and they reported
                  that there were no Indians about. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> did not believe that Cruzatte had shot him intentionally,
                  but that when he did not answer, Cruzatte was anxious to conceal his knowledge of
                  having done so. With the assistance of Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' clothes were removed, and the wound dressed by putting
                  lint into the bullet holes. The wound is so situated that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> can not move without great pain, and
                  he had to give up the idea of making celestial observations here. Joseph Fields
                  killed an elk, and then we went on — <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> lying in the pirogue. We found a

                  from Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>. This puts
                  an end to our hopes of obtaining some <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> chiefs to accompany us to the United

                  attentive and industrious man in whom we have placed the greatest confidence
                  during our entire journey. At 3 p.m. we proceeded together, having left the
                  bull-boats on the bank as we now have ample canoe space. We camped near
                  Charbonneau's Creek on a large sand point. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> dressed and washed <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>' wounds.</p>

                  number of natives, so we landed. The principal chief and the people are extremely
                  pleased to see us. After a short delay, we proceeded to Black Cat's <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village. We dispatched
                  Charbonneau back to the Minnitaree village with an invitation for them to visit
                  us, and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> went down
                  to the lower <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village
                  to ask Mr. Rene <span class="tei_name">Jessaume</span> to
                  come up and interpret for us. He arrived, and through him we spoke to the chiefs,
                  inviting some of them to accompany us to the United States. After the council, we
                  crossed to the opposite side of the Missouri to camp in a central position —
                  and a place where we would also be clear of mosquitoes. The chiefs promised us
                  some corn, and Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and two
                  men accompanied one to his village. They soon returned loaded with corn, beans and
                  squashes. Several chiefs came over, and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> counciled with them. The chiefs declined to go with us for
                  fear of the <span class="tei_name">Sioux Indians</span>

                  <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> again spoke to the
                  chiefs in regard to visiting the United States. They offered a young man of bad
                  character, and in fact, at the time had in his possession <span class="tei_name">Gibson</span>'s knife, which he had stolen. We informed
                  the chief of this, and the man delivered up the knife with a meek apology. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> reproached the chiefs for
                  offering such a man to see and hear the words of the Great Father— and they
                  hung their heads in shame. Charbonneau informed us that <span class="tei_name">Little Crow</span>, a second chief, wanted to go with us, so
                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> walked to his

                  shores of the Yellowstone and Missouri. As this offer was an advantage for <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, and his services could now be
                  dispensed with, the captains were disposed to be of service to one of our party
                  who had performed his duty as well as <span class="tei_name">John

                  wished <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> every succcss. We all
                  gave him some powder and lead and several other small articles which would he

                  the Missouri with his new-found friends. The example of this man shows how easily
                  man can be weaned from the habits of civilized life to the ruder, but scarcely
                  less fascinating life and manners of the woods. <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> had been absent for over two years from the
                  frontiers, and might naturally he presumed to have some anxiety, or some curiosity
                  at least, to return to his friends and country; yet, at the moment when he is
                  approaching the frontiers, he was tempted by a hunting scheme to give up these
                  delightful prospects, and go back without the least reluctance to the solitude of
                  the woods.</p>
               <p>The <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> had offered to
                  give us some corn, and sending Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> for it, we found they had given us a
                  greater quantity than our canoes could carry. We thanked the chief and took only
                  six loads. We presented the swivel gun to <span class="tei_name">Le
                     Borgne</span>— the one-eyed chief. As it cannot be fired from the small
                  pirogue we now have, and therefore is no longer useful to us, we thought that by
                  this present we might engage this powerful chief to our country's interest. <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> had it conveyed to his village
                  with great pomp. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  walked up to the village and found that "<span class="tei_name">Big

                  us if we would agree to take his wife and son, and also Mr. Rene <span class="tei_name">Jessaume</span> and his two children
                  along. This we were obliged to agree to do. We learned that the fine corn mill we
                  had given these <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> in
                  1804, had been broken up in order for them to procure pieces of iron, and as a

               <p>The principal chiefs of the Minnitaree came to bid us farewell, and as none of
                  them would go with us, Charbonneau, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pomp</span> took
                  their leave of us. We offered to take them with us, but Charbonneau said he had no
                  chance of making a livelihood below, and that he preferred living among the
                  Indians. Charbonneau has been very serviceable to us, and his wife, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, was particularly useful among
                  the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>. Indeed, she
                  has borne the fatigues of a long route, encumbered with an infant, who is now only
                  nineteen months old. We therefore paid Charbonneau wages of $500.33, including the
                  price of a horse and a lodge purchased of him. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> offered to take little <span class="tei_name">Pomp</span> but as he had not yet been
                  weaned, his parents observed that one year from now he would be sufficiently old
                  enough to leave his mother, and Charbonneau would then bring him down to <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> to raise and educate. To
                  this <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> agreed [and later
                  did]. We gave Charbonneau the blacksmith's tools and bellows to use among this
                  nation.</p>
               <p>We then dropped down to Shahaka's village to take him and his family aboard. There
                  was much crying by the native women. After smoking the pipe and giving some powder
                  and lead, Shahaka announced that he was ready, and was accompanied to our canoes
                  by all the village. After another council we set out and proceeded as far as our
                  old Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> where we
                  landed. All the buildings except one in the rear had been burned. Only some
                  pickets were standing in front next to the river. We were saddened to see the
                  present condition of our fort where we had spent so many happy hours during the
                  winter of 1804–1805. We then went on to the old Arikara village where we
                  landed.</p>

                  some hunters ahead, and by 2 p.m. we overtook them. They had killed three deer
                  which we divided among our Indians and we cooked dinner on a sand-bar. Shahaka
                  pointed out several places enroute where he said his nation had formerly lived.
                  After dinner we proceeded on and camped a little below the entrance of Heart

                  stretched it over some sticks, under which the captains slept dry. The Indians
                  appear satisfied with our party and mode of procedure. We have lashed the small
                  canoes together for safety, but still can make fifty or sixty miles a day in this

               <p>We embarked a little after sunrise. At noon we passed the entrance of the
                  Cannonball River. At evening we camped on a sand-bar. We only made eighty-one
                  miles as the water was rough, and the small canoes shipped water which required a

                  Grenier (Grienyea) and one other man from the Arikara. Two of them, Rivet and
                  Grenier, had wintered with us at the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> in 1804–5. They informed us that they

                  quite a young lad, who formerly had belonged with the North West Company of
                  traders, wished to return with us. The captains consented, and he was taken aboard
                  in one of the canoes to ply an oar. Rivet and Grenier had neither powder nor lead,
                  so we gave them some. [They probably took <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s letter up to Charbonneau.] After a delay of an hour, we parted

                  we camped on a sand-bar where the mosquitoes were not so troublesome. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> is recovering —
                  the hole in his buttocks where the bullet passed cut, is closed and is nearly
                  well. The hole where the bullet entered discharges very well.</p>

                  took three hunters and walked ashore. They got two fat elk, which were loaded in
                  the canoes. While we were thus delayed two hours, the men gathered plums and then
                  we proceeded to the place where we are to wait for the Fields brothers and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>. With the aid of the
                  spy-glass, we saw several men on horseback which proved to be Indians. We landed
                  and immediately twenty Indians were discovered on an eminence on the opposite side
                  of the river. Then we saw eighty or ninety Indians come out of the woods about a
                  fourth mile below us. They fired their guns as a salute, which we returned, but
                  were at a loss to determine of what tribe they were. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> took Cruzatte, <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jessaume</span>, who could speak <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>, to converse with them.
                  We found they were <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> of the same band that had attempted to rob and detain us in the
                  fall of 1804, and with whom we nearly came to blows. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> told them they had been deaf to our
                  councils and that they had abused white people since, such as <span class="tei_name">Charles Courtin</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Dickson</span> in the winter of 1805. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> told them to return to
                  their camp, and not cross to our side of the river, for if they did, we would
                  certainly kill them. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>
                  and the three interpreters returned to our camp and we inspected our arms. The
                  main part of the Indians set out for their camp, but seven of them halted on the
                  top of a hill and yelled insults at us. They told us to come across and they would
                  kill us all, etc., of which we paid no notice. All this time we were extremely
                  anxious for the arrival of <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> and the Fields brothers who were behind. To our great joy they
                  hove in sight at 6 p.m. We then set out and steered towards the shore where the
                  seven Indians were. This move put them in some agitation as to our motives, but we
                  then proceeded on down some six miles where we camped on a large sand bar in the
                  middle of the river. Our hunters killed nine prairie dogs, We put two sentinels on
                  guard. During the night it began to rain, and the wind blew so hard that the
                  cables of two of the canoes broke, and the canoes were blown to the opposite
                  shore. In these boats were Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>, <span class="tei_name">Weiser</span>, <span class="tei_name">Willard</span> and the Indian party.
                  Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and six men went over to
                  help them return, which was accomplished by 2 a.m. The whole party was
                  re-assembled and we waited in the rain for daylight.</p>

               <p>We all set out at the usual hour. Shortly afterwards, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>s, <span class="tei_name">Joseph Fields</span>, and <span class="tei_name">George Shannon</span> were landed on an island to hunt
                  deer. We went on past the Niobrara River where we encountered nine Indians who
                  beckoned us to land. We took them to be a war party of the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> and paid no
                  attention to them. As the Fields brothers and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> were behind, we landed on an open,
                  commanding position out of sight of the Indians to wait until our men came up.
                  About fifteen minutes later, several guns were fired by the Indians, which we
                  feared were at our men behind. <span class="tei_name">Capt.

                  remainder of the men in a defensive position. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>'s party proceeded some 250 yards when
                  we saw the canoe with our men in the distance — and the Indians were where
                  we had left them. The Indians informed us they were <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> and one of our Frenchmen knew one
                  of them to be the brother of young Pierre Dorion's wife. We then invited them to
                  the canoes to smoke. We asked if any of their chiefs had gone down the river with
                  Mr. Dorion, and they answered that their Great Chief and many of their brave men
                  had gone down with him to visit the President. We gave them some ribbons and a
                  bushel of corn. <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span> gave
                  them a pair of excellent leggings. The Fields brothers and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> having joined us, we took leave of this

                  At 2 p.m. we arrived opposite the ancient fortifications, and we set our men to
                  hunt on both sides of the island. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> killed an elk while <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> walked on the shore of the river. At Bonhomme Island we
                  brought two years together on the 1st of September of 1804 and 1806. After we were
                  all together again, we went on down to a large sand bar opposite the bluff where
                  we had previously met the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> in council, and here our old flag-pole was still standing as

                  sunset we proceeded to a sand bar below where we hoped to be free from the
                  mosquitoes which harbor around the wooded banks of the shores. We killed two
                  turkeys which were much admired by the Indians, as they were the first that they

                  4:30 p.m. we spied two canoes with eighteen men aboard. As we came alongside, we
                  were met by Mr. James Aird, a trader with the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>. He received the captains with every mark of

                  of the politics of the country. Mr. Aird gave us as much information as he could.
                  Soon after we landed, a violent thunder storm and rain came up, which continued

                  We found this very agreeable, although we still have a little flour left from our
                  deposit made at the mouth of Maria's River. All we could give in return was about
                  six bushels of corn. At 8 a.m. we set out, and at noon we came to <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>'s Bluff. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>, Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and several of the men ascended the bluff to

                  saw no game worth killing — only pelicans, geese, ducks, eagles, etc. We

               <p>We set out early, and at the Great-Cut-Off we saw a herd of elk. We landed and
                  sent out several hunters to get some, but they were very wild and ran off, so the
                  hunters returned without killing any. Capt. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sent two canoes ahead with hunters to search
                  on the bottoms below. After a short delay, we went on and soon met one of the
                  trading boats of Mr. Auguste Chouteau; this one under the charge of Mr. Henry
                  Delauney, with twelve Frenchmen. We purchased a gallon of whiskey from him,
                  promising to pay Mr. Chouteau at St. Louis (which he later would not accept). We
                  gave each man a dram which is the first they have tasted since July 4th, 1805.
                  Several men, including Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>,
                  exchanged their leather shirts for linen ones, and beaver skins for course hats.
                  At 1 p.m. we set out. They gave us a salute from a swivel they had, which we
                  returned with our rifles. We went on three miles and came to our hunters. They had
                  not killed anything. At five miles more we overtook the canoe of our other hunters
                  with <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span> in it — the
                  two Fields brothers being in the woods behind. We landed on a sand bar and
                  delayed, waiting for the Fields brothers. We sent out three men to hunt. The
                  Fields brothers did not join us, and <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> thinks they are below. Our Indians are getting weary of the

                  proceed. We agreed that should we overtake the hunters we would fire a gun which
                  would be a signal to come on. We had proceeded only eight miles by water —
                  though the direct line distance was only about a mile, when we found the hunters
                  and took them on board. We fired the gun as a signal for Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> to proceed. We went to a bottom where we came
                  to — and sent out the hunters. They killed three elk and we sent out some
                  men for the meat on which, with some catfish, we cooked and dined. Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his men came up, and after
                  taking a sumptuous dinner, we all set out at 4 p.m., and at dusk we encamped on a

                  men from St. Louis in charge of Mr. La Croix, enroute to trade with the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>. We made a few inquiries
                  and then proceeded through a very bad part of the river crowded with snags,

               <p>We set out at our usual time at sunrise. At about seven miles we met two pirogues
                  from St. Louis. One belonged to Mr. Chouteau, bound for the Platte, while the

                  accompanied us in 1804 as high as the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> [<span class="tei_name">Joseph Collin</span> ?]. He informed us that Mr. <span class="tei_name">Robert McClellan</span> was a few miles below. We saw a

                  Gravelein ], the Arikara interpreter, whom we had sent down with an Arikara chief
                  and Cpl. Warfington in the spring of 1805. We examined their instructions and
                  found that Mr. <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> was
                  ordered to the Arikara nation with a speech from the President of the United
                  States to that nation, and some presents which had been given to the Arikara chief
                  who had visited, and unfortunately had died, in Washington. He was also instructed
                  to make every inquiry after the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> party — no intelligence having been received from us for a
                  long time, and they were beginning to be concerned about us. They had heard that
                  we were all killed, and that the Spaniards held us captive in their mines, etc.
                  Mr. Pierre Dorion, Sr., was also present, and had been instructed to accompany Mr.
                     <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>, and through his

                  was instructed to make inquiries after us.</p>
               <p> The evening being wet and cloudy, we concluded to lay by all night. Mr.
                  McClellan, whom the captains had known before when he was a scout in Wayne's army
                  in 1794–95, was very polite, and gave us all the news. We sent two canoes
                  with five hunters ahead. Some of the men exchanged robes for shirts, and were
                  treated in the best possible manner by the McClellan party.</p>

                  we set out. We landed at the camp of the five hunters whom we had sent ahead, but
                  they had killed nothing. As the wind was high and there were many snags below, we

                     <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> felt unwell and had
                  some chocolate made, which Mr. McClellan had presented to us, after which he found

                  four deer and a turkey. We delayed here until 5 p.m., when the hunters all joined
                  us, then we proceeded down a few miles and encamped. <span class="tei_name">George Shannon</span> left his horn, pouch powder and

               <p>We set out early. This is that part of the Missouri where the Kansas Indians
                  resort to robbing the traders passing up the river. They have the custom of
                  examining everything in the pirogues, and taking what they want. It is probable
                  they may want to take these liberties with us. This we will not allow, and at the
                  smallest insult we shall fire on them. At 2 p.m. we met three large boats bound
                  for the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span>
                  and the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>; the property
                  of Mr. La Croix, Mr. Aiten and Mr. Chouteau of St. Louis. Their men received us
                  with friendship and pressed on us some whiskey, biscuit, pork and onions. These
                  men are much afraid of meeting with the Kansas Indians. We killed five deer today.

                  Frenchmen. We examined his license to trade which appeared doubtful, and the

                  rejoiced at our return. He informed us that we had long since been given up by the
                  people of the United States, and almost forgotten, though <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span> yet had hopes for us. He
                  gave us some biscuit, chocolate, sugar and whiskey, for which our party was in

                  plantation under tolerable way since we have been on our expedition. We delayed a
                  short time and then crossed over the Mississippi, where at about noon we arrived
                  at St. Louis. The party fired their guns as a salute, and we landed opposite the
                  center of the town. We were dressed entirely in buck-skin except for the linen
                  shirts the men had bought from the traders just previously.</p>
               <p>We unloaded the canoes and carried the baggage up to the store rooms of Major
                  William Christy. The party is considerably rejoiced that we have the expedition
                  completed. We looked for boarding in town, and wait for our pay. We then intend to
                  return to our native homes to see our parents and families once more, as we have
                  been so long from them. The captains accepted the invitation of Mr. Pierre
                  Chouteau to stay at his house.</p>

               <p>The captains rose early and commenced to write letters to the President, <span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span>, Gen. Wm.
                  H. Harrison and Charbonneau. We sent the first of these letters by <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> across the river to
                  Cahokia where the post has been detained to receive them. After dinner the
                  captains went to a store to purchase some goods and engage a tailor to make them
                  some clothes.</p>

               <p>While the captains were busy with their reports and letters, the men sunned and
                  dried all of the goods and articles. They were then stored at the warehouse of Mr.
                  Caddy Chouteau. The captains paid some formal visits to the gentlemen of St.
                  Louis, who entertained us in the evening with a dinner and a ball.</p>
               <p>The horns and skeletons of the big-horn sheep, along with the robes, grizzly bear
                  skins, barking squirrels, mule deer skins, Clatsop hats, Indian baskets, etc.,
                  were packed and sent to Washington. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> advised <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span> by letter that the expedition had, in obedience to
                  orders, crossed the continent and had sufficiently explored the interior, to have
                  discovered the navigable headwaters of the Missouri and Columbia rivers by the
                  most practical route. He gave a resume of the trip, but noted that he would soon
                  give a more full report in person. However, he would be necessarily delayed some
                  days to settle with, and discharge the men who had accompanied him on the voyage
                  of discovery. He will bring the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Chief, Shahaka, and with respect to the exertions and services
                  rendered by his worthy friend, <span class="tei_name">Capt.
                     Clark</span>, he cannot say too much. He noted that if any credit be due to the
                  success of the arduous enterprise in which we have been engaged, that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span>, equally with himself, is
                  entitled to the consideration of yourself and the country.</p>

            <p>The men were paid off and discharged on October to, 1806, and for most of them it was
               the end of the adventure. They drifted back to their families and friends. Some
               married and settled on farms. Others returned to the mountains in the employ of the
               fur traders who were now anxious to penetrate the newly discovered, rich beaver
               streams on the headwaters of the Missouri and Yellowstone. <span class="tei_name">Capt. Clark</span> promptly returned his commission in the
               army. The discharge given to William <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> is typical of that given the others:</p>

            <p>Unfortunately not much more can be added to the lives of the men who comprised the
               expedition than has been given in the brief biographies in the preceding "Roster."
               The main hope for additional data may be in the discovery of Sgt. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span>'s journal, the <span class="tei_name">Robert Frazier</span> journal, and the original manuscript
               journal of <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span>. As indicated
               in my roster, there is the promise of further information yet to be discovered by
               genealogical research.</p>
            <p>Among the obscure records of the fur traders there is the report of David <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span>
                <a href="#nfinis02" id="lnfinis02" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> of one <span class="tei_name">Charles Courtin</span>, or Courter, a Canadian who had sworn allegiance to the
               United States in order to ascend the Missouri in 1805. In July 1807, Courtin and his
               party of forty-two Americans were in the Columbia River basin among the <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>. Two of these members
               are stated to have been former members of the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition. They could have been two men of the
               return party of 1805, and perhaps Francois Rivet was one. Phillipe Degie, who was not
               a regular member, could be the other.</p>
            <p>It can easily be imagined that for many of the men the return to civilian life was a
               difficult time of adjustment. After their exciting return they must have been
               acclaimed and feted, and this in itself was a complete change from their former
               woodsman lives, and from the privations they had just come through. Then as today,
               men have had a problem in adjusting to sudden fame and adulation, and not everyone
               can successfully take it in stride. We can understand then, if a few of these men
               fell by the wayside. For most of them however, it was an experience passed, with a
               future to be met. Like hundreds of other citizens about them, they fitted into the
               routine pattern of earning a living, marrying and raising families.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and Mr. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived in Frankfort, Kentucky,
               about the 18th of November 18o6, accompanied by Mr. Chouteau and Chief Shahaka, his
               family and interpreter, Rene <span class="tei_name">Jessaume</span>. A party of <span class="tei_name">Osage</span>s also went along. They all went on to Washington, except citizen
               William <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. He visited his
               brothers in Louisville, and then went on to Virginia to woo <span class="tei_name">Julia Hancock</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was not interested in the gala receptions given
               in Washington on January 10 and 14, 1807, in honor of the expedition's triumphant
               return, so <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> attended
               these affairs without his companion, <span class="tei_name">William
                  Clark</span>.</p>
            <p>Early in 1807, Lewis was appointed Governor of Upper Louisiana, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was appointed Brigadier General of
               the Louisiana Militia. They soon had their hands full of political problems in the
               new Territory. There was the Aaron Burr conspiracy for which ex-member Robert <span class="tei_name">Frazier</span> had been uncovering alarming
               evidence of treason, and was a witness at the trial.</p>
            <p>Governor Lewis stepped into a tangled mess. The original French settlers had problems
               with the influx of American settlers. There were uncertainties and confusion with the
               French, Spanish and American land titles. The bitter antagonism of the jealous
               Secretary of the Territory, Frederick Bates, was of no help. The Indians did not like
               the treaties they had signed, the traders did not like any regulation whatever, and
               the British were keeping the fires alive under all. The War Department began to
               protest Capt. Lewis' drafts, and it was more than Governor Lewis could handle. In the
               end he set off for Washington to try to get the matters straightened out.</p>
            <p>On March 9, 1807, the authorization for the land warrants promised by Congress was
               received, and the following men signed a receipt for the bounty: <a href="#nfinis03" id="lnfinis03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

            <p>It may be assumed that these twenty-two men were present in St. Louis at the time.
               The others were scattered over the country and had to sign, or have Governor Lewis
               sign for them, at a later time.</p>
            <p>Eventually the expenses of the expedition were totaled. There was the extra pay, the
               land grants and a hundred other charges added to the costs. It was finally estimated
               at a cost of $38,722.25 which depended on how certain charges were construed as
               actual costs or incidental charges to the expedition. Were the costs of transporting
               and entertaining the Indians in Washington a proper charge to the expedition? So the
               stated figure is as good as any, and certainly not an unreasonable amount for the
               value received.</p>
            <p>Inevitably the scandal mongers had to have their say. They have tried to imply that
               there was a secret romance between <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, and that
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> left descendants among the
                  <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span> and other
               tribes. As to the first charge, there is no question that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> felt sorry for the hard life of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, and he respected her. So did
               everyone else. He certainly tried to help her children have a better life, but beyond
               that there is no proof of any romance whatsoever. As to the descendants, the men were
               normal and the native women were willing. But why <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> should be singled out as the only parent among
               the whole party can only be because he was now a famous name. Scandal is only of
               interest and is repeated if it can be attached to the names of celebrities.</p>
            <p>It is sometimes inferred that the skirmish which Capt. Lewis had with the <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> Indians up on the
               Cut Bank River was the cause of the bitter animosity which the <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> carried on against
               the white traders for so many years that followed. <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> later learned from the <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> themselves that they
               felt the actions of their men justified the retribution that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> and his men inflicted upon them, and
               that they got what was to be expected in an unsuccessful raid.</p>
            <p>And then there are those inferences that <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> was the commander while <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was only an adjutant. Of course this is
               technically true, but there is no evidence that the commanders nor any of the men
               ever drew such a distinction. The equality of command is abundantly clear throughout
               the expedition. The remarkable fact is that there never was a recorded occasion,
               during or after the expedition, when the leaders did not work together in complete
               appreciation for each other's abilities. This is the more remarkable for both
               captains were opposites in temperament. Lewis was better schooled but showed several
               instances of shorttempered impulsive actions. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was usually firm and unruffled. Though there is
               no intimation of it, Lewis in his wounded and painful condition, must have been
               annoyed when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> kept dropping down
               the Missouri when it had been agreed that they would rendezvous at the mouth of the
               Yellowstone. Furthermore, the men must have been inclined to turn to the warm and
               friendly <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, rather than to the
               more aloof and unapproachable Lewis. These were conditions which normally bring about
               jealousy and dissension, particularly as they saw each other day in and day out for
               over two years. Their loyalty and friendship to each other under all conditions is
               one of the classic friendships in all recorded history.</p>
            <p>The same loyalty is evident among the men. In their journals they are silent, or at
               most, extremely discreet, about mentioning any of the unpleasant things such as
               punishments and dismissals. One can read between the lines and find suggestions of
               cases where the men got on each other's nerves. We are hardly told that <span class="tei_name">John Robertson</span> was dismissed from the
               party, and no reason is given, but it seems clear that he was a trouble maker and did
               not fit in with the other men. He was dismissed — without comment. We learn
               there were a few quarrels such as the one between <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> over leading a spare horse. No one tells us what
               really motivated it, for to them it was unimportant. Knowing human nature, these
               things would normally have happened.</p>
            <p>In answer to those who might construe that the captains' friendship and loyalty to
               each other was only a bearing assumed to see the expedition through, and that they
               subdued their inner feelings with a bold front for the sake of example — there
               remains the final test. The expedition was now an accomplished fact and former
               promises could have been conveniently forgotten, particularly as there was so much
               opposition from the War Department against <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>.</p>
            <p>When Secretary of War Dearborn, proposed that the enlisted men should receive 320
               acres of government land as an extra bonus; that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> should get 1000 acres; while Lewis was to
               receive 1600 acres, Lewis rebelled. To the very end in Lewis' steadfast conviction,
               they had been in equal command and had shared equal responsibilities, and each should
               receive the same reward. To the credit of official Washington it is recorded that
               they got the point, and each leader was awarded the same amount — 1600 acres.
               Yes, both were true to their dying days, and such respect and friendship are rare and
               unique in human relations.</p>
            <p>And this loyalty prevailed among the enlisted men. Loyalty to each other, loyalty to
               their captains and loyalty to their country by opening up a vast new country and in
               bending every effort to bring the expedition's purpose to its successful close. For
               this they should be remembered and honored. A good place to start would be for
               enlightened state governments to restore the original names of the rivers and creeks
               which were named for the members of the expedition.</p>

                  <p>A tantalizing bit of information is contained in a letter to me from Milo M.
                     Quaife, dated Detroit, January 19, 1945, from which I quote in part: "As
                     recently as 1929, a member of the <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> family at <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>, Canada, brought me two letters. One of them was <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>'s last
                     letter written at St. Louis, May 23, 1809, and addressed to his half-sister,
                     Mary Louise, wife of Lambert Parent of Detroit. – When Miss <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> brought me these
                     two letters just noted, I of course proceeded to inquire whether she had any
                     more of the family letters. She answered that some years before her parents had
                     moved from <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span> to
                     Hollywood, California, and had died there. Miss <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> herself before returning to <span class="tei_name">Windsor</span>, had placed the family
                     furniture in storage with some storage company, and it was still in their
                     possession in 1929. Meanwhile, the charges which had accrued upon it had become
                     so large that she was unable to pay them and recover possession of the
                     furniture. The pertinent point in this connection was that she stated there was
                     a box of family papers included among her parents' possessions. Of course I
                     wanted to recover the box but saw no way to do it in view of the circumstances
                     recited. Fifteen years have passed and I have no present knowledge of Miss
                        <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>'s
                     where-abouts. It is perhaps a fair supposition that more of <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>'s letters and family
                     papers were dumped into the rubbish heap by the storage company in Hollywood,
                     at some date subsequent to 1929. Sincerely Yours, M. M. Quaife."</p>
                  <p>I am advised that the storage companies usually auction off such goods held for
                     delinquent payments. There is the remote possibility that some second hand
                     furniture dealer may yet have this box of papers.</p>

               <div class="note">23 While this book was being prepared for the printer,
                  I received a most informative communication from Mr. Anton J. Pregaldin of
                  Clayton, Missouri, in answer to an earlier request of mine for data regarding the
                  French-Canadian engagee members of the Expedition. Mr. Pregaldin has been
                  researching and compiling the genealogies of the French pioneer families from the
                  Catholic parish registers and other records for many years. He has kindly allowed
                  me to incorporate his material into my biographies of these men. I am most
                  grateful for such data, as it throws more light upon these men, long lost in the
                  darkness of time and neglect. Mr. Pregaldin states: "Research on the voyagers is
                  difficult because many of the Frenchmen on the rivers came from Canada and either
                  returned there after a time, or died in the Indian country. These, of course,
                  would not be likely to leave much trace in the Parish registers." </div>

                  <p>
                     <blockquote><p>Old Dorion was one of those French-creoles, descendents
                        of ancient Canadian stock, who abound on the western frontier, and
                        amalgamate or co-habit with the savages. He had sojourned among various
                        tribes, and perhaps left progeny among them all; but his regular, or
                        habitual wife, was a <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> squaw. By her he had a hopeful brood of half-breed sons, of
                        whom, Pierre Jr., was one. The domestic affairs of old Dorion were conducted
                        in the true Indian plan. Father and son would occasionaly get drunk
                        together, and then the cabin was the scene of a ruffian brawl and fighting,
                        in the course of which the old Frenchman was apt to get soundly belabored by
                        his mongrel offspring. Once one of his sons had him on the ground and was
                        about to scalp him. "Hold! my son, you are too brave, too honorable to scalp
                        your father." This appeal touched the French side of the half-breed's heart
                        so he suffered the old man to wear his scalp unharmed.</p></blockquote>

                  Prairie Creek, is a bluff which Lewis had named "Rattlesnake Cliffs" because of
                  the number of snakes he found there. As its form more resembles a beaver than does
                  the one which <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> called "The
                  Beaverhead," this has resulted in some confusion. Locally, the cliffs are now
                  known as the "Beaverhead" while the proper one is called the "Point of Rocks." It
                  was in this area that <span class="tei_name">John Potts</span> was
                  later killed by the Blackfeet.</div>

                     <span class="tei_name">Joseph
                        Dickson</span> (often, but incorrectly, rendered Dixon), was born January
                     13, 1775, in Pennsylvania. In 1802 he settled and trapped on the American
                     Bottom, Illi- nois, across the Mississippi from St. Louis.</p>
                  <p>Forest <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> (usually
                     spelled Hancock; I use the form taken from his signa- ture in the Missouri
                     Hist. Soc. Coll.) was perhaps raised in Boonesborough, Ken- tucky, hut later
                     lived in Maysville. He probably was a Ranger under Simon Kenton. He came to
                     Missouri with Daniel Boone in 1799 and lived near the latter at Boone's Lick,
                     Missouri.</p>
                  <p>Both <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> built a pirogue and
                     went up the Missouri in the summer of 1804. They wintered in a cave built near
                     present <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> City, Iowa.
                     In the spring of 1805 they proceeded up the Missouri and apparently joined
                     Charles Cour- tin's trapping party for protection. The <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> robbed them of most
                     all their merchandise and furs. <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span> was wounded, and the white men barely preserved their lives.
                     They passed the winter of 1805-06 with the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>, and in the spring of 1806, reached the
                        <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>.</p>
                  <p>That summer they trapped on the Missouri, working their way upstream and on
                     August 11, 1806, met <span class="tei_name">Captain
                        Clark</span> and his men returning from the Pacific. A few days later they
                     had influenced <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span> to
                     join them on a trapping venture. After a dispute with <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span>, the partnership dissolved after six
                     weeks, and <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> and <span class="tei_name">Colter</span> returned to winter with the
                        <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span> remained alone, probably
                     on <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s Fork of the
                     Yellowstone, and trapped and wintered there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">Dickson</span> made his way to St.
                     Louis by the summer of 1807; disposed of his furs, and retired from the
                     mountains forever. He settled his family in Sangamon County, Illinois, and died
                     in 1844 at the home of a daughter in Morgan County, Illinois.</p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="tei_name">Handcock</span> left the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> in the spring of
                     1807 and was soon hired by <span class="tei_name">Manuel</span>
                     <span class="tei_name">Lisa</span> as a trapper. <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span> and <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> were with this same party.
