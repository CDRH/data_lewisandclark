I think it may be established as a general maxim that those nations treat their old people and women with most diference [deference] and rispect where they subsist principally on such articles that these can participate with the men in obtaining them; and that, that part of the community are treated with least attention, when the act of procuring subsistence devolves intirely on the men in the vigor of life. It appears to me that nature has been much more deficient in her filial tie than in any other of the strong affections of the human heart, and therefore think, our old men equally with our women indebted to civilization for their ease and comfort.

On the front cover of this draft is a list of men's names in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> hand. Since <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau's</a> and the four soldiers' names are included, we may suppose that this is a list of the persons who made the trip, excluding <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</a> name and that of her child, <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste</a>, who surely went along. The list names thirteen rather than twelve persons, but <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a> may have been thought of as a supernumerary when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote twelve in the text. The column of names reads: "<a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Serjt Pryor</a>, Peter [<em class="hi">either <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Cruzatte</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Weiser, Peter" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Weiser%2C%20Peter">Weiser</a>

Another column of words is opposite the names but apparently unrelated to them. The reason for the plus marks is not known, but may have been a further inventory check: "Meadle +, Dollar +, Bags, Beeds +, Wampom +, Knives +, F. Hooks +, Paint +, Ribin +, Wire +, arm bands, red flag +, 3 files +, needles +, Thread, Paper &amp; Ink pen &amp;c." Except for the last, these may have been items taken along as Indian presents or for trade. Finally two columns of figures and these random jottings appear on the cover: "Boate, Beautiful, Elegant, neat, 15–4."
