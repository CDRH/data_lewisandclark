         <div class="introduction  tei_div">
            <p>The roots of the expedition of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">William Clark</a> were already
lengthy by the time of the Louisiana Purchase in April 1803. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Thomas Jefferson's</a>
curiosity about the West was lifelong, sustained by his broad scientific interests
and his hopes and dreams for the future of the United States. For at least twenty
years before he launched <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> across two thousand miles into immortality, <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> had planned for a transcontinental expedition starting up the
<a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a>. In 1783, while serving in Congress, he asked the frontier Revolutionary War hero <a class="regularization" title="Clark, George Rogers" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20George%20Rogers">George Rogers Clark</a> (the older brother of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">William</a>) to consider
leading a privately sponsored expedition to explore the West. Then, as later, he
feared that <a class="regularization" title="Britain" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Britain">Britain</a> might secure a foothold west of the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> (then the western boundary of the United States) and forestall American expansion. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, George Rogers" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20George%20Rogers">George
Rogers Clark</a> declined the offer. <a href="#ngi000001" id="lngi000001" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>A few years later, while minister to <a class="regularization" title="France" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=France">France</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> encouraged the hopes of
<a class="regularization" title="Ledyard, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ledyard%2C%20John">John Ledyard</a>, an American veteran of <a class="regularization" title="Cook, James" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cook%2C%20James">Captain James Cook's</a> third voyage to the
Pacific. <a class="regularization" title="Ledyard, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ledyard%2C%20John">Ledyard</a> planned to travel eastward across <a class="regularization" title="Siberia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Siberia">Siberia</a>, secure passage on a
ship to some point on the western coast of North America, and then strike out
alone across the continent. It was a far-fetched project at best, and the suspicious
Russians frustrated it by expelling <a class="regularization" title="Ledyard, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ledyard%2C%20John">Ledyard</a> from their country. <a href="#ngi000002" id="lngi000002" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In 1792 <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>, then secretary of state under <a class="regularization" title="Washington, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Washington%2C%20George">Washington</a>, and various
friends and associates in the American Philosophical Society in <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>
tried to interest <a class="regularization" title="Marshall, Moses" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Marshall%2C%20Moses">Dr. Moses Marshall</a>, a physician and botanist from <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>,
in undertaking an expedition up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>. They offered a reward of a thousand guineas to <a class="regularization" title="Marshall, Moses" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Marshall%2C%20Moses">Marshall</a> if he could provide proof of having reached the "South
Sea," but apparently nothing came of the suggestion. <a href="#ngi000003" id="lngi000003" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The following year, <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> sponsored a more promising effort by <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">André
Michaux</a>, a French botanist. Acting for the American Philosophical Society,
<a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> sent <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">Michaux</a> west to "find the shortest &amp; most convenient route of
communication between the U. S. &amp; the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific ocean</a>, within the temperate latitudes, &amp; to learn such particulars as can be obtained of the country through which it passes, it's productions, inhabitants &amp; other interesting circumstances." Avoiding Spanish authorities who might try to stop him, <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">Michaux</a> was to ascend
the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and, from its headwaters, locate the easiest route to some major
stream flowing into the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>. Here already was the basic outline of the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> exploration. To appreciate how ambitious the scheme was it must be
remembered that most of the territory <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">Michaux</a> was to traverse and the people
who inhabited it were either little known or wholly unknown to Europeans.
Moreover, <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> had every reason to believe that the Spanish government,
which claimed jurisdiction over <a class="regularization" title="Louisiana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, would be hostile to the project. Only
ten years later <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> could provide <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> with far more information about the lower <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Coast" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Coast">Pacific Coast</a> than he was able to give <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">Michaux</a>. In any event, <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">Michaux</a> became involved in international intrigues and
never crossed the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>. <a href="#ngi000004" id="lngi000004" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> made no further serious attempt to promote the exploration of the
trans-<a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> West until he became president in 1801; then, circumstances
made the project seem not only feasible but also vitally necessary. As president,
<a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> was in a better position to launch such an expedition and to insure adequate financing; in the same year, world political conditions seemed, more than
ever, to threaten the preemption of the West by some other nation.</p>
            <p>By the time <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> entered the <a class="regularization" title="White House" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=White%20House">White House</a>, there had been several significant advances in knowledge of the country beyond the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>. In 1792, the
American sea-going trader <a class="regularization" title="Gray, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gray%2C%20Robert">Captain Robert Gray</a> had discovered and named the
<a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>. In the same year, <a class="regularization" title="Vancouver, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Vancouver%2C%20George">Captain George Vancouver</a> of the British
Navy had made a thorough survey of the northwest coast, sending one of his
officers about one hundred miles up the great river. In the same decade, fur
traders from <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>, acting under the authority of the Spanish government,
moved up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> as far as the villages of the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a> in present <a class="regularization" title="North Dakota" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=North%20Dakota">North
Dakota</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Evans, John Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Evans%2C%20John%20Thomas">John Thomas Evans</a>, who reached the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a> in 1796, received instructions from his employer, <a class="regularization" title="Mackay, James" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Mackay%2C%20James">James Mackay</a>, that seem to anticipate <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a>
instructions to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Evans, John Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Evans%2C%20John%20Thomas">Evans</a> was asked to ascend the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> to its
headwaters, inquire of the Indians about a river flowing "toward the setting
sun," and descend this stream to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>. Along the way he was to collect
specimens of animals and plants and to be "very accurate in his observations concerning the nations." <a class="regularization" title="Evans, John Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Evans%2C%20John%20Thomas">Evans</a> in fact got no farther than the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a>, where he found British traders extending their commercial network from <a class="regularization" title="Canada" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Canada">Canada</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Evans, John Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Evans%2C%20John%20Thomas">Evans's</a>
detailed maps of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> from present northeast <a class="regularization" title="Nebraska" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Nebraska">Nebraska</a> to the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a>
villages were eventually of great assistance to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. <a href="#ngi000005" id="lngi000005" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The catalyst, however, of <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> decision to launch the expedition was
apparently the publication of <a class="regularization" title="Mackenzie, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Mackenzie%2C%20Alexander">Alexander Mackenzie's</a>
               <em class="hi">Voyages from <a class="regularization" title="Montreal" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montreal">Montreal</a> … through the Continent of North America, to the Frozen and <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Oceans</a>
               </em> (<a class="regularization" title="London" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=London">London</a>,
1801); therein <a class="regularization" title="Mackenzie, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Mackenzie%2C%20Alexander">Mackenzie</a>, a partner in the North West Company of <a class="regularization" title="Canada" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Canada">Canada</a>, described his 1789 trip to the <a class="regularization" title="Arctic Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> and his 1792–93 journey across the
<a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a> to the coast of present <a class="regularization" title="British Columbia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. He had made the first crossing
of the continent north of <a class="regularization" title="Mexico" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mexico">Mexico</a> and had discovered what he took to be the
upper reaches of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>. Having proved that such a crossing was possible,
he urged in his book that Britain develop the transcontinental route, in order to
secure the fur trade and open commerce with Asia. Here again was the danger
that <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> had long feared—British preemption of the far West. <a href="#ngi000006" id="lngi000006" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Many historians have seen <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> appointment of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</a> as his
private secretary in 1801 as evidence that he intended from the first to send the
young man on a western expedition, especially since <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> knowledge of the
"western country" was a factor in <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> choice. Historian Donald Jackson
argues that there is no proof of such an intention and suggests that <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>
may have wished to make use of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> knowledge of the army to weed out officers
with Federalist leanings. Although <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> had stated the contrary, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> frontier experience, especially with Indians, was meager. One should not forget, however, that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had volunteered in 1793 for the expedition for which <a class="regularization" title="Michaux, André" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Michaux%2C%20Andr%C3%A9">Michaux</a> was actually chosen and that in 1805 he would write of the transcontinental exploration as "a darling project of mine for the last ten years." <a href="#ngi000007" id="lngi000007" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In any case, it was <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> that <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> now selected to lead the enterprise on
which he had definitely determined by the end of 1802. Born in <a class="regularization" title="Virginia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Virginia">Virginia</a> in
1774, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had served as an army officer in the Northwest Territory for several
years and had some experience with wilderness travel. His formal education was
slight by present standards, but he was well read and had the scientific interests
that characterized so many of <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> friends. What <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> really wanted
was "a person who to courage, prudence, habits &amp; health adapted to the woods,
&amp; some familiarity with the Indian character, joins a perfect knoledge of botany,
natural history, mineralogy &amp; astronomy." His knowledge of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and his acquaintance with the American scientific community told him that Lewis was as close to such a paragon as he could realistically hope to find. <a href="#ngi000008" id="lngi000008" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The Louisiana Purchase did not prompt the expedition to explore west of the
<a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>; <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was already on his way across the <a class="regularization" title="Appalachian Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachians</a> in the summer
of 1803 when <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> sent him definite word of the diplomatic windfall that
had occurred in <a class="regularization" title="Paris" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Paris">Paris</a> the previous April. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> hopes had always pointed
toward eventual American penetration of the lands beyond the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a>, but the French decision to sell this vast territory presented the United States with an
opportunity of which the president could only have dreamed for the distant future. Now an expedition became all the more important as an inspection and an assertion of sovereignty over the new empire. <a href="#ngi000009" id="lngi000009" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>

<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> is stereotyped as the moody, sensitive intellectual, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> as the tough, pragmatic, barely literate frontiersman. The differences existed, but they may have
been exaggerated. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> quite adequately demonstrated his mastery of wilderness craft on his great journey, and the expedition did not suffer as a result of

If
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> spelling was versatile and his grammar rough hewn—in a day when the

Enlightenment, believed all knowledge to be of some benefit. He characterized
the enterprise as "purely literary"—devoted to gathering and disseminating scientific knowledge—in sounding out the Spanish minister on his government's
possible reaction to the expedition; the minister was understandably skeptical.

carefully regulated trade and intercourse with the Indians that would avoid
some of the evils of unrestrained competition and interracial conflict so common

future settlers. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> expected a great deal of two infantry officers, but they

of the captains, and one that they thoroughly fulfilled. As Donald Jackson has
observed, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> were "the writingest explorers of their time.

wrote constantly and abundantly, afloat and ashore, legibly and illegibly, and always with an urgent sense of purpose." <a href="#ngi000023" id="lngi000023" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> They left us a remarkably full record of
their enterprise, but questions about that record remain unanswered. One of the
most vexing problems of the journals, as such, concerns a question whose answer
might appear quite obvious: when and how were the journals written? The immediate and natural supposition of any reader is that the entries were written
day by day on the dates placed at their heads by the authors. Examination of the
journals now available, however, discredits that expectation. The existence of
duplicate journals, mainly by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, for certain periods of the expedition, and
internal evidence indicating that many entries cannot have been written on the days they cover, require greater consideration of the journal-keeping methods of
the captains.</p>

captains' methods of keeping a journal than anyone else who was not with the
expedition, but he did not reveal it to his readers. By the time anyone again examined the journals at length, the authors were no longer available to provide
what were no doubt simple explanations of many mysteries and apparent inconsistencies. When Elliott Coues examined the notebooks in the American Philosophical Society archives in 1892–93, he was struck by their good condition and
concluded that the predominant red morocco-bound books, at least, could not
have crossed the continent: "The covers are too fresh and bright, the paper too
clean and sound. . . . The handwritings are too good, and too uniform. . . . The
red books were certainly written after the return of the Expedition, and before
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> death in October, 1809—that is, in 1806–9." <a href="#ngi000024" id="lngi000024" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In opposition to Coues's belief that the journals might have been written, in
part, as late as 1809 is <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> statement that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> turned the notebooks over
to him "on his return"—that is, on or soon after <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington</a> on
December 28, 1806. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> understanding was that they had been written day
by day, and that each notebook was sealed in a tin box when finished to protect it
from the elements. Even assuming that <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> learned the exact procedure
the captains followed, his description, written from memory nine years later,
might not be precisely correct. However, he was hardly likely to have gained the
impression that the volumes he specifically called "travelling pocket journals"
were written on the trip if they were blank when he first saw them on <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
return. Nothing could have kept the president from poring over them, as he apparently did those sent back from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in 1805. His words strongly imply that the notebook journals were more or less complete by the time of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>

            </p>
            <p>Of course, Coues never imagined that the captains wrote their journals from
memory in the years after their homecoming. The red books he viewed at the
American Philosophical Society did not include some other notebooks there that
have different bindings; their condition convinced him that those could have
been on the expedition, and he thought that true of some but not all the small,
fragmentary items of a few sheets each that he examined. Those last he thought
likely to be the remains of field journals made on the spot, day by day, their information later being transferred into the notebooks. <a href="#ngi000026" id="lngi000026" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>When Reuben Gold Thwaites examined additional materials that he discovered a few years later, he found among them <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Elkskin-bound Journal, as
he called it, covering the same period as some of the red books. This new volume, written on letter paper later sewn together and bound, undoubtedly in the field, seemed to fit exactly the description of field notes, later copied and expanded in the notebook journals. The Elkskin-bound Journal and some other
new fragments made Thwaites confident that he understood the captains' basic
procedures:

<blockquote><p>It was the daily custom of the captains to make rough notes, with rude outline maps,
plans, and miscellaneous sketches, in field-books which they doubtless carried in their
pockets. When encamped for a protracted period, these were developed into more formal records. In this development, each often borrowed freely from the other's notes—<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, the better scholar of the two generally rewriting in his own manner the material
obtained from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>; while the latter not infrequently copied <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> practically verbatim,
but with his own phonetic spelling. Upon returning to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>, these individual journals
were for the most part transcribed into neat blank books—bound in red morocco and gilt-edged—with the thought of preparing them for early publication. After this process, the
original field-books must have been cast aside and in large measure destroyed; for but
one of these [<em class="hi">the Elkskin-bound Journal</em>] is now known to exist. There have come down
to us, however, several note-books which apparently were written up in the camps. <a href="#ngi000027" id="lngi000027" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
               </p></blockquote>


Thwaites did not attempt to say just when the field books were made, nor why
some field notes and journals, notably the Elkskin-bound Journal, were preserved when so many others were "in large measure destroyed."</p>
            <p>Thwaites's explanation is broadly plausible, but again we confront <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a>
statement that the red books turned over to him at the beginning of 1807 were
written on the trip. If <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> was mistaken on this point, then Thwaites's theory requires the captains to have written the entire body of red notebook journals—fourteen notebooks containing several hundred thousand words—between the arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> on September 23, 1806, and late December 1806.
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> last journal entry (September 26, 1806), apparently written in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>,
says that "we commenced wrighting &amp;c," but as noted, there is no indication of
what they were writing.</p>
            <p>Following Thwaites's theory, the red books had to have been written in the
course of some three months or a little more, during which the captains were
traveling; visiting relatives; seeing to other business; and attending public ceremonies, welcoming celebrations, and banquets. During that period <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was
also escorting the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> chief <a class="regularization" title="Big White (Sheheke)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Big%20White%20%28Sheheke%29">Big White</a> (<a class="regularization" title="Big White (Sheheke)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Big%20White%20%28Sheheke%29">Sheheke</a>) to the capital. Moreover,
substantial parts of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journals for the last part of the expedition are evidently copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>. On the journey to <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington</a> the captains separated
in mid-November and did not reunite until January 21, 1807, when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> reached
<a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington</a>. Unless <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> left a great part of his journals with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, which seems
most unlikely, the period during which the journal writing could have been done
narrows to a period of less than two months after the expedition's arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St.
Louis</a>. If we add the fact that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> next to last notebook journal has a lengthy
passage in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> hand, inserted in the middle with no apparent gaps in the writing, the theory that the red books were wholly the product of the period after the
return to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> seems questionable.</p>
            <p>There are other good reasons for doubting the postexpedition theory of composition. Eighteen red books are known, all having some connection with the expedition, though it is not known when the captains obtained them. One of them
is Codex O, as labeled by Coues, which contains Lewis's astronomical observations for the first year of the expedition and his summary of creeks and rivers. It
is generally believed that this book was among the materials sent back from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort
Mandan</a> in April 1805; it has no data collected after that time. If so, then the
captains had it with them from the start, and in all probability they had all eighteen identical books from the beginning, wherever they were purchased. No one
can possibly imagine that they carried eighteen notebooks to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> and back
without having intended from the first to write in them along the way.</p>
            <p>There is no specific reference to the red books in any of the preexpedition
lists of supplies. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> listed "Books" and "Writing paper" among his requirements for the trip, and since he did not specify titles, the books may well mean
notebooks. He drew "8 Rect. books" from the U.S. arsenal in <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a> and
purchased six packing boxes for "Stationary &amp;c." there, in the spring of 1803.
An undated memorandum in Codex C, in an unknown hand, lists goods packed
for the expedition at some point. The list includes four bales of goods, each containing "2 tin Boxes, with 2 mem. Books in Ea."; a recapitulation of the same
goods in the memorandum gives "8 tin Boxes with memm. Books". This gives
sixteen books. Among <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> personal effects inventoried after his death in 1809
were "Sixteen Note books bound in red morocco with clasps." The coincidence in
number is striking; it would indeed be conclusive, except that there are eighteen
red books extant, all having some connection with the expedition. There is no
really satisfactory way to account for the two extra books. Since there is no certainty when the memorandum in Codex C was written, we cannot say which red
books might have been in use and so not listed among those packed. For instance,
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> used Codex O for his astronomical observations from the beginning of the
expedition. If the Codex C list was made up just before setting out from <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">Wood
River</a>, Codex O might not have been packed away in a relatively inaccessible box
in a bale but could have been with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or easily available.</p>
            <p>It is, of course, entirely possible that the captains purchased two more identical books after the expedition, and it would be exceedingly difficult to say which
of those now known would be the extra two, since all eighteen red notebooks
contain or apparently did once contain material that could have been written
during the expedition. Neither is there any clear indication of which two red
books <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> would not have included among the expeditionary materials he had
with him on his last journey in 1809. The captains' practice of taking pages from
one notebook and inserting them in another makes it impossible to be certain what material (particularly the fragmentary <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> items) may have been in what

               <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> says the books were "cemented" up in tin boxes for protection when
completed, but that they had been removed from the boxes before <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> delivered them to him. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> must therefore have told him those details,
which implies that they gave him some information about their methods of journal keeping. The captains could have kept the notebooks in boxes sealed in some
manner to keep out moisture, taking them out for writing in relatively sheltered
camps or when the weather was good, while rough field notes served for daily
entries under less favorable conditions.</p>
            <p>Writing in 1807, <a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">David McKeehan</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass's</a> editor, sought to establish the
reliability of <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> work by stating, "At the different resting places during the
expedition, the several journals were brought together, compared, corrected, and
the blanks which had been unavoidably left, filled up." <a href="#ngi000029" id="lngi000029" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> This information, vague
and unspecific as it is, could only have come from <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a>; the journals referred to
could be field notes or notebook journals, or both. Certainly such resting places
would have been the points at which the notebook journals were brought up to
date, if they were not, in fact, the journals in which the entries were kept day
by day.</p>
            <p>The discovery in 1953 of rough, unbound notes by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, covering, besides
the period at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a>, the first eleven months of the expedition—the same
period as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> first three notebooks—complicates as much as it clarifies. One
can easily believe that these scribbled, interlined entries, written on miscellaneous sizes of loose paper, often over sketch maps, arithmetical calculations, and
addresses on used envelopes, were first-draft notes taken in the field on the journey up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>. It is then easy to imagine <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> copying and expanding on
them in the notebooks whenever time allowed, even as late as the winter at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort
Mandan</a>. Once they reached <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, however, the Field Notes become increasingly skimpy, with gaps sometimes weeks in length. For this period we must
either imagine another full set of field notes, whose existence is both unproven
and unnecessary, or suppose that in this period <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote his entries daily into
a bound journal. <a href="#ngi000030" id="lngi000030" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>There is, however, material in the notebooks that is not in the Field Notes,
indicating that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote into them when events were fairly fresh in his mind.
In his Codex A entry for July 4, 1804, we find reflections on the <a class="regularization" title="Kansa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Kansa%20Indians">Kansa Indians</a>
not in the Field Notes. On the other hand, in the Codex A entry for July 23,
1804, he names <a class="regularization" title="Camp White Catfish (Iowa)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20White%20Catfish%20%28Iowa%29">Camp White Catfish</a>, although the fish for which the camp was
named was not caught until the next day. Thus we must assume that the codex
entry was written on or after July 24, or that he wrote the entry on the twenty-third, inserting the name of the camp later—which from the appearance of the
page is entirely possible.</p>
            <p>In the Field Notes for August 20, 1804, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> records in the present tense that
<a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd</a> was seriously ill, then writes of <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd's</a> death. In Codex B
for the same day, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> repeats the description of <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd's</a> illness and death. One
must suppose either that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote both the Field Notes and Codex B simultaneously, with considerable difference in wording, or that he wrote the codex entry later, without taking into account his knowledge that <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> had died. This
journalistic convention persists throughout the journals and, of course, complicates the problem of determining the time of writing of particular entries. In any
case, in the notebook entry of August 20, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> refers to <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> as "our Decesed
brother," a phrase not found in the Field Notes—perhaps evidence that he wrote
the notebook entry when the emotion was still fairly fresh.</p>
            <p>On October 13, 1804, a court-martial of party members tried <a class="regularization" title="Newman, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Newman%2C%20John">Private John
Newman</a> for "mutinous expression." <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> brief record of the episode in his
Codex C entry for October 13 says that <a class="regularization" title="Newman, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Newman%2C%20John">Newman</a> was tried "last night." Apparently he wrote the codex entry the day after the trial. The paragraph on the trial,
comes at the very end of the entry, so it is likely that the whole entry was composed on October 14, the day after its ostensible date. This is at a time when the
Field Notes entries are still continuous and fairly extensive; the Codex C entry,
however, includes much information not found in the Field Notes, apparently
taken down by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> at the time he received it. At this time he was obviously
copying and expanding his first notes into the notebook journal quite promptly.</p>
            <p>During the <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> winter, when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> notebook entries are quite full,
entries in the Field Notes for widely separated dates follow one another without
any evidence of missing pages. In fact, a single sheet, document 64 of Ernest
Osgood's arrangement of the Field Notes, contains the entries for the period
from November 19, 1804, to April 3, 1805; the entries follow one another with
no indication of spaces for later insertion of material. Sheets in the Field Notes
may have been lost, but it seems more likely that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote directly into his
notebook journal. As further evidence, note that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> kept the bound book up
to date when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> was absent for ten days in February on a hunting trip; <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
then wrote a short summary of his excursion in the book on his return. From the
appearance of the journal, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote this account immediately after his return,
rather than inserting it later.</p>
            <p>It does not seem wise to postulate the writing of field notes by either captain in
cases where none have been found and there is no strong evidence of their having
existed. Theories involving the existence of such notes are to be avoided unless
the evidence clearly requires them. The sheer amount of labor involved in composing multiple sets of notes and journals argues against such suppositions. Considering the history of journal discoveries to date, however, no one would wish to
assert positively that there are no lost notes or journals, or that none will ever be
found. Certainly there are cases where notebook journal entries were clearly
written weeks or months after the given date, and then it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that the writer kept notes of some sort.</p>
            <p>The discovery of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes consisting of the Dubois and River Journals, and other discoveries at various times and places, may seem to support the
possibility of other such field journals. But the Dubois Journals relate to the period before the expedition proper and were not the basis, as far as we know, for a
duplicate set of notebook journals. Obviously <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> kept both field notes and
notebook journals for the journey up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, but it does
not necessarily follow that he used the same procedure throughout the expedition, especially since he apparently did not follow this method at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>
and his field notes fall off sharply after his arrival there.</p>
            <p>On April 7, 1805, the permanent party set out upriver from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>; at
the same time, the keelboat carrying the discharged members of the party headed
down river with a load of dispatches, papers, and specimens for delivery to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>. At this point we encounter more complex problems of journal-keeping procedures and missing notes.</p>
            <p>The first question concerns just what journal materials were sent to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>
on the keelboat. At several points in the summer and fall the captains indicated
that they intended to send back a pirogue with some of the soldiers and boatmen
under <a class="regularization" title="Warfington, Richard" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Warfington%2C%20Richard">Corporal Richard Warfington</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> indicates more than once that they
were preparing materials to be sent back with that party. As it happened, they
did not dispatch the return party until the following spring, for reasons never
stated. Both <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> wrote letters to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> indicating what they were
sending, but neither was specific enough to spare us some puzzlement. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
wrote on April 3, 1805, that he was sending the "notes which I have taken in the
form of a journal in their original state," apologizing because "many parts are
incorrect." <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> wrote that they were sending the president "a part of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
Clark's</a> private journal, the other part you will find inclosed in a separate tin box.
The journal is in it's original state, and of course incorrect, but it will give you the
daily detales of our progress, and transactions." A great deal hinges on the meaning of the expressions "private journal" and "original state," and on how we interpret the two parts of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journal. <a href="#ngi000031" id="lngi000031" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Various interpretations are possible. We could take <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes to be a
"private" journal, and the notebook journals to be "public" or official; thus the
Field Notes constitute one part and the notebook journals—Codices A, B, and
C—the other. We might take the Dubois Journal and the River Journal, the two
parts of the Field Notes, as the two parts meant, but there is no evidence that the
Dubois Journal ever went to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>, and the division into the Dubois Journal and the River journal is merely a modern convenience. The argument can be
made that the two parts were parts of the River Journal itself, on the basis of a
notation by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> on document 56 of the Field Notes. One side contains journal
entries for September 20–23, 1804. The other side bears an address:<br/>

            </p>
            <p>On the same document under the September 23 entry <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote, "I must seal
up all those scripts &amp; draw from my Journal at some other time."</p>
            <p>The address and the conclusion of entries on the same sheet seem to indicate
that the captains still hoped to send a party back before winter, and that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
intended to send the Field Notes to his oldest brother <a class="regularization" title="Clark, Jonathan" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20Jonathan">Jonathan</a>, to be kept until
his return. They had kept <a class="regularization" title="Warfington, Richard" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Warfington%2C%20Richard">Warfington</a> with them past the end of his enlistment in
August so that he could head the return party. We might suppose that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
made sure that his notebook journals were up-to-date at this point, since he
could not use the Field Notes for this purpose after sending them back, and he
may have brought the notebooks up-to-date similarly when they considered
sending materials back from <a class="regularization" title="Camp White Catfish (Iowa)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20White%20Catfish%20%28Iowa%29">Camp White Catfish</a> in July. On the other hand, if
the notebooks were not up-to-date, this could be the reason why the return party
did not set out before winter. This might even be the reason why <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> neglected
the Field Notes at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> and apparently wrote directly into his notebook
journal, the earlier procedure having proved too time-consuming.</p>
            <p>On document 58 of the Field Notes is a notation by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>: "A Continuation of
notes taken assending the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missourie</a> in 1804—by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">W. Clark</a>." It may be, then, that
the two parts of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> "private journal" are the two parts of the Field Notes—
the part sealed up to be sent to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, Jonathan" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20Jonathan">Jonathan Clark</a> in September 1804, but not sent,
and the notes taken after that time. The note about "A Continuation" could indicate that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> thought of the Field Notes as being in two parts. <a href="#ngi000033" id="lngi000033" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Against the above interpretation, however, is another notation by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, written April 2, 1805, on document 64 in the Field Notes, during preparations to
send off the keelboat and its cargo from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>:

<blockquote><p>I conclude to Send my journal to the President of the United States in its original State for
his own perusial, untill I Call for it or Some friend if I Should not return, an this journal
is from the 13th of May 1804 untill the 3rd of April 1805.</p></blockquote>

Here again is the phrase "in its original state," suggesting that the journal referred to is the same as mentioned in the captains' letters to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>
"private journal." What journal was it?</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> says the journal began on May 13, 1804, which cannot apply to the Field
Notes, unless he was in error. The last document of the Dubois Journal ends on
May 14, and the River Journal's first sheet begins with the same date. The first
notebook journal, Codex A, however, does begin on May 13. The journal to be
sent back, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> says, ends on April 3, 1805; that is true of the Field Notes and, in
a sense, of the notebook journals. The April 3 entry in Codex C is followed by a
list of items to be sent back on the keelboat, then the entries for April 4–7. Since
the entry for April 3 in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes shows that they expected to leave the
next day, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> could well have thought of the April 3 entry in Codex C as the
last, adding a list of materials to be sent back for <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> information. Thus,
when he wrote in the Field Notes on April 2 that the journal went to April 3, that
could also have been the case with the notebook journals. Since they did not, in
fact, leave until April 7—due presumably to last-minute delays—it was natural
for <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> to add entries for the extra days in Codex C.</p>
            <p>With such an indication that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> considered his notebook journals to be in
their "original state," it seems reasonable that the two parts of his journal were
the Field Notes and the notebook journals—Codices A, B, and C. That the notebook journals went to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> is clear from <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> letter to <a class="regularization" title="Barton, Benjamin Smith" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Barton%2C%20Benjamin%20Smith">Benjamin Smith

by the Indians in terms very similar to those in Codex C but not in the Field
Notes. <a href="#ngi000034" id="lngi000034" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a> It seems most likely that the Field Notes also went to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>, though
there is no specific evidence proving this. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did note in a letter from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N.

in <a class="regularization" title="Louisville, Ky." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Louisville%2C%20Ky.">Louisville</a>, and the Field Notes would meet this description. It is likely, however, that those "papers" consisted of the Dubois Journal, not the River Journal.

have been the wrapper in which the <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">Wood River</a> notes (Dubois Journal) were
sealed for shipment to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, Jonathan" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20Jonathan">Jonathan Clark</a>. If those notes were in a separate packet,
it may have been because they were going to a different destination than the
River Journal, sent to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>. That <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote a full entry for November 30
on document 65 may only mean that he thought of taking up regular keeping of
the Field Notes after they had settled in at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, then abandoned the

then, seems reasonably clear. On the upriver journey he kept daily field notes
and copied and expanded them into his notebook journals as convenient, sometimes neglecting the Field Notes at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in favor of writing directly into Codex C. The daily continuity of the Field Notes ends with November 13, 1804,
the entries becoming increasingly irregular; document 64 covers the entire period from that date to April 3, 1805, and appears to be the last sheet of the Field
Notes. During the building of <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in early November, the keeping of
two journals may have seemed too much of a burden in the midst of other demanding work. If so, then Codex C was presumably up-to-date at that time, and
perhaps Codices A and B were also. Codices B and C, however, overlap on October 1, 2, and 3, and the entries in Codex C for the first and second are skimpy
in comparison to those in Codex B. Possibly <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> began writing in Codex C
when Codex B was not yet up to date, on the first of October. The fuller entry
for October 3 is in Codex C, and conceivably he had caught up and filled in
Codex B by then.</p>
            <p>More difficult to explain is <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journal-keeping procedure and particularly
the large gaps in his writing, which raise the possibility of missing manuscripts.
The largest gap, and the one most curious to historians, is the long hiatus from
the start of the expedition in May 1804, until the group set out from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in April 1805. That gap is particularly bewildering because we would expect
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> to be more conscientious at the outset of the expedition, especially in light
of <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> explicit instructions about the keeping of multiple journals. <a href="#ngi000036" id="lngi000036" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a> So incredulous have some observers been at this gap that they have speculated that
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was probably keeping either field drafts or standard journals of the party's
activities that have since been lost. <a href="#ngi000037" id="lngi000037" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>To say that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> was keeping no journal from the outset is not precisely correct. There exist two small fragments, called Codices Aa and Ba by Coues, for
the dates May 15 and 20, and September 16–17, 1804. Those sheets, apparently
torn from one of the red books, suggest to some that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was keeping a journal
for the initial period, and that the remaining pages were so soiled, ruined, or
unnecessary that they were discarded. Or perhaps the remaining pages are simply
lost. Another explanation seems plausible and is presented here as part of a larger
conception of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journal-keeping activities throughout the trip.</p>
            <p>In Codex Aa it is noteworthy that the order of days is reversed; the entry for
May 20 precedes the entry for May 15, with no break between the two. The entry
for May 20 recounts <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> activities for that day as he set out by land from <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St.
Louis</a> for <a class="regularization" title="Saint Charles, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Charles%2C%20Mo.">St. Charles</a> where he was to rendezvous with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, who was leading
the party upriver. The entry also reports the activities of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> party. Perhaps
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> saw this entry as the beginning of his journal keeping since the captains
had determined to set out the next day (May 21). Then why the addition of notes
for May 15? That is a more detailed report of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> trip upriver, written as if
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had been present. Information in that entry exceeds the notes taken by
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> for that day in either of his two accounts (Field Notes and Codex A) and
probably came directly from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. Perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> thought he ought to add an entry for May 15 after his May 20 entry to give a more detailed account of the
actual start of the expedition. Although <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> set out from <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River Dubois</a> on May
14, the captains had earlier established May 15 as the date to begin, and perhaps
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> still had that date in mind.</p>
            <p>Codex Ba presents a different situation. On September 16 and 17, 1804, the
group was encamped at <a class="regularization" title="American (Corvus) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=American%20%28Corvus%29%20Creek">"Corvus" Creek</a> just above today's <a class="regularization" title="White River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=White%20River">White River</a> in <a class="regularization" title="South Dakota" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=South%20Dakota">South
Dakota</a> (see <em class="hi">Atlas</em> map 21). There the captains made the decision not to send back
the pirogue with artifacts and other items representing their journey thus far.
Perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had thought that their notes to that point would return to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St.
Louis</a> with the other materials and eventually reach <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">President Jefferson</a>; thus, he
may have considered that he was now beginning a journal, in a sense the first for
him since he had apparently quit writing after his May 15 entry. Having made
the decision not to send a boat and crew back, he may have ceased his journalizing (indeed, he stopped at midpage in midsentence) and perhaps delayed writing again until after the winter at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>.</p>
            <p>Even before those dates <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> may have established a pattern of laxness in
journal writing. He began a diary (here called the Eastern Journal) when he left
<a class="regularization" title="Pittsburgh, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pittsburgh%2C%20Pa.">Pittsburgh</a> in August 1803, as he descended the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> enroute to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>,
but from September 19 to November 11, he made no entries. He left thirty-nine
pages blank in the notebook between those separated entries, however, perhaps
with the intention of supplying the missing information later, but that hiatus was
never filled. About October 26, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> joined <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> at <a class="regularization" title="Louisville, Ky." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Louisville%2C%20Ky.">Louisville</a>, but <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> did
not turn over journal-keeping chores to his friend at that time. Had he done so,
today we might have a more complete record of the remainder of the trip to
<a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a>, for <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> was a more consistent recorder than his companion.
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> returned to journalizing on November 11 and gave the journal to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> on
November 28, near <a class="regularization" title="Kaskaskia, Ill." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kaskaskia%2C%20Ill.">Kaskaskia</a>, as they separated while <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> went ahead by land
to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> brought the boat party forward to establish <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a>.
From that point we have a nearly consistent record because of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> faithful
journal keeping. <a href="#ngi000038" id="lngi000038" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>

            <p>Those writing gaps of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> may be instances of a larger pattern of negligence. The gaps as a whole include the missing days from the Eastern Journal
(September 19 to November 11, 1803); the lapse from May 14, 1804, to April 7,
1805 (with the exceptions noted); only spotty entries from August 26, 1805; to
January 1, 1806; and the final hiatus from August 12, 1806, to the completion of
the expedition. The last gap can be explained by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> being partially disabled
from a wound; in contrast to other stoppages, he noted that he was laying down
his pen at that point. In all from May 1804, to September 1806, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> missed
over four hundred days of journal entries. <a href="#ngi000039" id="lngi000039" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Some authorities have supposed that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was keeping field notes during the
period from <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> and intending to use that material to fill regular notebooks later, or that the fragments from a red book (the entries
for May and September) were part of a complete set of notes that are now lost.
Jackson has made the strongest case for <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> having kept notes during the first
leg of the journey, but he emphasizes the speculative nature of his conclusions.
Briefly, Jackson believes that a mishap on May 14, 1805, may indicate a loss of
journals. On that day one of the pirogues turned on its side and filled with water,
and some of the papers and notebooks got wet. Jackson discovered that within a
few days of the accident <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> began conscientiously to copy into his own journal
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> natural history notes, something he had not previously done. Jackson argues that the spoilages may have been greater than expected, convincing the captains that duplicating all records was necessary, not just keeping multiple diaries.
He also conjectures that "perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> notes for the entire first leg of the expedition were either badly water-soaked or entirely lost." Thus, Jackson believes
that the entries by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> for May and September 1804 may be fragments of a
larger journal from that early period. Thwaites also thought that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was a
regular journal-keeper, but his reasoning is less plausible than Jackson's. He supposed that the journals may have been lost after <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> death in <a class="regularization" title="Tennessee" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.
However, we would expect that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> would have bemoaned such a
loss at some time, but neither ever made reference to so serious a loss in any
known source. Jackson's answer for a reason that there is no mention of the supposed loss of journals in May 1805 is that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> would tell <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> about the
accident after his return but that there was no need to announce it to the world
in his diary. <a href="#ngi000040" id="lngi000040" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a>

back from the extreme navigable point of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> (a scheme later rejected) and with that boat "I shal send you my journal." Again, one can read the
phrase variously: is <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> to send a journal he has been keeping or one he intends to write? Rather than speculate on the hidden meaning of the letters, it is
better to examine the totality of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journal keeping and to interpret from

material is known to be missing. As the expedition's naturalist he kept fairly extensive notes on the flora and fauna of the region through which the party passed.
In Codex R, he made a list of herbarium specimens that he was collecting. The
descriptive writing is occasionally lengthy and shows not only <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> powers of
observation but also his record-keeping activities. Observations of animals are
almost as extensive and cover over fifty pages of Codex Q. The captain was also
noting mineral deposits and geologic features along the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and taking
astronomical observations—both time-consuming tasks that included record-keeping. And, although <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> cannot be credited directly, it is known that the
captains were keeping lists of Indian vocabularies during this period, work that
may have amounted to extensive note taking. The vocabularies are the missing
material that might exhibit additional record keeping by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>.</p>
            <p>From January to May 1804, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was keeping a weather diary. Those observations are repeated in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Codex C, and it seems probable that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was
copying <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> entries. After May 14 there is a gap of weather data in both captains' books until September 19; the notations are then resumed with hardly an
interruption until April 3, 1805, when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> began placing weather data with
the daily entries. The weather notes indicate a substantial amount of writing because they consist of two temperature readings for each day, the general state of
the weather, the wind direction, and the rise and fall of the river. There are also
comments on natural history including sightings of animals and the budding and
fading of flora. It is uncertain whether <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> made the notes along the way or at
<a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, but it was a collaborative effort of the captains. <a href="#ngi000042" id="lngi000042" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a>

            <p>Evidence that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> may have done more extensive writing exists in the form
of a single loose sheet from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes (Osgood's document 35). The
sheet is entirely in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> hand and contains on one side a draft for <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> description of the <a class="regularization" title="Platte River (Nebr.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Platte%20River%20%28Nebr.%29">Platte River</a>, which he later transferred into Codex O as his survey of rivers and creeks. Although there is a date of July 21 (1804) on the document, the reverse contains lunar observations (also in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> hand) for February
23, 1805, while the party was at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>. It could be that the draft describing the <a class="regularization" title="Platte River (Nebr.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Platte%20River%20%28Nebr.%29">Platte</a> was also written at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N.

Because the draft from the Field Notes is an incomplete portion, it is certain that
other pages are missing; whether they describe only the <a class="regularization" title="Platte River (Nebr.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Platte%20River%20%28Nebr.%29">Platte</a> or are a full draft
of his summary may never be known. If <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was keeping thorough topographical notes throughout the first portion of the trip, it helps explain why no daily
entry material has been found. It may simply have amounted to too much writing.</p>
            <p>Taken together, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> recording activities up to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N.

large amount of writing and may represent a proportional share of the writing
duties of the captains. What emerges is a picture of the two men sharing journal-keeping chores, though not following <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> prescription to the letter. It is
difficult to believe that all of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> daily-entry journals (except for a few pages
of writing for May and September 1804), from <a class="regularization" title="Saint Charles, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Charles%2C%20Mo.">St. Charles</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N.

notebooks of writing, and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, the more verbose, would have written even
more. Unless actual journals by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or definite references to such writing are
discovered, it seems likely that he kept no record of daily events for this period.</p>
            <p>One incident on the way to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> may corroborate the notion that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
kept no journal of daily events during that period. On July 14, 1804, a sudden
storm hit the river, and great gusts of wind turned one boat on its side so that it
began to fill with water. Cool heads and quick action saved the vessel from destruction, but <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> reported that his notes of the previous day had blown overboard during the accident. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> mentioned that the loss "obliges me to refur to
the 〈notes〉 Journals of Serjeants, and my own recollection [of] the accurences
Courses Distance &amp;. of that day." If <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had been keeping a journal of events
during this time, why would <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> go to the journals of the sergeants or depend
on his own recollection for the "accurences?" Certainly he would have trusted
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> notes over his memory or the notes of enlisted men if <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journal had
been available <a href="#ngi000043" id="lngi000043" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>From the April 7, 1805, departure from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> to late August 1805,
complete notebook journals for both captains exist, with no fragmentary or parallel journals until August, although some copying was being done between the
two men. There is no indication that either followed <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> earlier practice of
writing field notes and transferring them, with revisions, into notebook journals.
Indeed, there is no reason to assume that the captains consistently followed any
one plan or procedure throughout the expedition. Their responsibility was to
keep as complete a record as possible of the many kinds of information that
<a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> wanted and to preserve that record from harm or loss. They could
follow any procedure that suited their convenience and the conditions of the
moment, in keeping with that mission. External conditions varied so much
throughout the trip that there was every reason to change journal-keeping procedures to conform to the needs of the moment. When they were inconsistent in
so much else, there is no reason to expect them to be consistent in this.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to believe, then, that for every finished journal there was a
preliminary set of field notes nearly duplicating it, as in the case of the River
Journal and Codices A and B. Without the known existence of field notes, or
strong evidence requiring them, there is no need to assume that they were made.
Duplication of journals would serve as insurance against loss or damage, but with
both captains definitely keeping journals after April 7, 1805, there would be less
need for keeping both field notes and notebook journals, which amounted to a
time-consuming task. <a href="#ngi000044" id="lngi000044" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Field notes, however, would be of value in situations where there was an increased risk of damage or loss from weather or difficult travel conditions, when it
seemed wise to seal up the notebooks in tin boxes (described by <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>) and keep field notes easily accessible or carried on the person. Such precautions
could also be taken when one of the captains was scouting ahead on foot, accompanied by only a few men; he might leave his notebook journals with the main
body, for convenience or in case something happened to him and he did not return. After such separations, one might copy the experiences of the other into
his own journal, to insure the preservation of a complete record.</p>
            <p>As they moved up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> around the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a>, the captains were separated at various times in June, July, and August 1805, as one or the other was
ahead, portaging the falls or later looking for the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshone Indians</a>. In these
intervals, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> sometimes copied <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journal for the days of separation under
the date of their reunion, suggesting that he was keeping the notebook journal
day by day. At other times, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> gave an account of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> activities in his own
entries for each day, indicating that those entries must have been written after
they were reunited. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> in this period did not ordinarily copy <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> record of
daily events while they were separated. <a href="#ngi000045" id="lngi000045" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In some of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> red notebooks are extra pages he apparently inserted, sometimes torn from other red books but at least once cut to fit from letter paper. The
handwriting on the inserted sheets is neater and more legible than <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> usual
bold but rather careless hand, but it is definitely <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>, and the need for legibility is the likely reason for many of the insertions. This circumstance strengthens the likelihood that the ordinary handwriting represents daily entries written
on the trail, during the day or in camp. A notable example is <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> insertion of
pages to recopy his survey notes of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a> portage, already written in his
rougher hand in the middle of his June 17, 1805, entry, probably during the
course of the day. He decided to copy the notes over for greater legibility and in
fact inserted more sheets than he needed. The inserted sheets are in the middle
of the original rough notes. <a href="#ngi000046" id="lngi000046" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>There are four fragmentary journals by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> from August and September
1805, designated Codices Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd by Coues. Each consists of a few
loose sheets covering periods of two to five days. Codex Fa describes events also
related in more detail in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> Codex F; the others are all from periods after the
end of Codex F, during a hiatus of over four months for which there are no other
known <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> journals, except for a later fragment, Codex Ia. <a href="#ngi000047" id="lngi000047" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a> It is tempting to
regard them as being literally "fragments," that is, portions of a lost body of field
notes by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> covering perhaps the entire gap in his journal from late August
1805, to January 1, 1806. But the fragments themselves provide no evidence for
this hypothesis. If they had portions of a previous day's entry at the beginning, or
of the next day's entry at the end, there would be good reason to regard them as
portions of a larger body of notes now lost. On the contrary, however, they appear to be complete in themselves. Codex Fa has a dated heading for an entry at
the end that was never written, since only a blank space follows the date on the last sheet of the codex. Moreover, all of the fragments except Fc relate to periods
when the captains were separated; Fa chronicles a scouting excursion ahead of
the main body when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> might have preferred not to risk his notebook journal,
and the other two describe periods when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> scouted ahead and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had to
keep a record of the movements of the main party. Codex Fc derives from two
days of relative leisure at <a class="regularization" title="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20%28Travelers%27%20Rest%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29">Travelers' Rest</a> in western <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a> when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> may

one place, suggesting that he may have kept this information in separate notes
and transferred it to his notebooks when time allowed. It may be that he kept
course and distance notes on the same sheets with sketch maps, as he did with

day on which <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Elkskin-bound Journal begins, continuing until December
31, 1805. It thus overlaps his red notebook journals Codex G (to October 10),
Codex H (October 11–November 19), and Codex I (to December 31). This journal consists of sheets of letter paper sewn together and crudely bound in elkskin,
presumably in the field. While we cannot be certain whether it was bound before
or after writing, the fact that it ends precisely on the last day of 1805, the day
before <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> known journal-writing again resumes, strongly suggests the latter.</p>
            <p>From September 11 to 20, the Elkskin-bound Journal consists of courses and
distances, with sketch maps of the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a> route. The courses and distances
become progressively more detailed, briefly mentioning daily incidents; by September 13 they are in effect short journal entries in themselves. After September
21, the book becomes a regular journal of daily events. Here some speculation
seems warranted. The <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a> was one of the roughest parts of the trip, the
trail hazardous and the weather terrible; the horse carrying <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> writing desk
slipped down a mountainside on the fifteenth, smashing the desk. These were
conditions under which it would be prudent to seal up the notebook journals in
tin boxes for protection and keep rough field notes along the trail. The sketch
maps and courses and distances suggest that the elkskin book started out as the
sort of route notes <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> kept at other times, such as those with <em class="hi">Atlas</em> maps 33–42.
Their becoming progressively more extensive from September 11 to 20 suggests
that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did indeed seal up Codex G at some point during this period, the
Elkskin-bound Journal becoming the preliminary journal, the first draft for the
notebooks. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> went ahead with a few men, looking for game, on September
18, and the courses and distances in the elkskin book become particularly extensive from that date. There can be no certainty, however, that was the date when
Codex G was sealed up.</p>
            <p>From September 21, the elkskin book consists of regular daily entries in the
conventional form, not in the form of courses and distances. September 20 was
the day <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> met the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> at <a class="regularization" title="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Weippe%20Prairie%20%28Camas%20Flats%2C%20Quawmash%20Flats%29">Weippe Prairie</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Idaho">Idaho</a>, a meeting described
in some detail in the elkskin notebook courses and distances. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and the main
party did not catch up until September 22. If Codex G was in a tin box on a
packhorse with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> group, we can understand why <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote his regular
September 21 entry in the elkskin book. He traveled a few miles that day but gave
no courses and distances until the next day, September 22, when he wrote, "our
first course of yesterday was nearly. . .," as if he had not written it down anywhere else and was going by memory. There may have been no notes other than
those in the elkskin book.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> courses and distances for September 11–21 and September 25 are together in Codex G after the September 30 entry; he may have taken the notebook out on that day and brought it up to date, or he may have been keeping
entries in it and simply have delayed copying the courses and distances because
he was busy. In any case, he continued to keep journal entries in the elkskin book
until December 31, paralleling notebook journal entries in Codices G, H, and I.
That the Elkskin-bound Journal entries were the first draft and the codices the
second seems probable. For much of the period from early October to early December the expedition was going downriver in small dugout canoes, and when
they neared the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Coast" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Coast">Pacific Coast</a> they entered an area of almost constant rain and
storms. It may have seemed wise to keep the red books in their waterproof boxes
much of the time and continue to use the sheets that became the Elkskin-bound
Journal.</p>
            <p>The elkskin book begins on the exact date of starting on the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a>, which
may indicate that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had not kept detailed field notes for some time before
that but had written daily information directly into his notebook journals. He
could well have been keeping course and distance notes, with sketch maps of the
route, as he had earlier, notes such as the pages in the elkskin book apparently
started out to be. But why were those bound notes preserved if similar ones for
an earlier period (the summer and fall of 1805) were not saved also? We must, of
course, allow something for sheer chance, but the special care taken to bind the
notes suggests a particular need to preserve material covering that period. One
reason for preserving them might be the exceptionally large number of maps
(nineteen) along with the journal material; none of the maps of the Elkskin-bound Journal are repeated in the codices for the same period. Again note that
there are, to our present knowledge, no notebook journals by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> from late
August 1805, to January 1, 1806; only fragmentary loose sheets are known, and
all except one (Codex Fc) cover periods when the captains were separated.</p>
            <p>The Elkskin-bound Journal ends the day before <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> is known to have resumed his journal-keeping, the first day of 1806. It would be a remarkable coincidence if <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> just happened to run out of paper in the book on that day. Internal evidence indicates that large portions of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> notebook journals after early
November 1805 were probably written months later. If the sheets in the elkskin
book were the only continuous record by either captain for a period of over
three and one-half months, then we can readily understand why they took special care to preserve them. If <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> red books were sealed up and packed away
for much of that time, we can also understand why what started out as rough
notes and sketch maps became a journal of events as well. <a href="#ngi000050" id="lngi000050" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>

            <p>What was <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> doing with his notebook journals during the period (September 11–December 31, 1805) covered by the Elkskin-bound Journal? Entries in
late September and early October 1805 in Codex G are generally more extensive
than those in the Elkskin-bound Journal; both are brief during periods when
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> was ill or particularly busy. After the party set out down the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater
River</a> in canoes on October 7, the Elkskin-bound Journal again becomes primarily expanded courses and distances. Codex H, however, begins on October
11, and from this point the elkskin book entries again become progressively
more detailed and lengthy, as if it were again the record actually kept on the
given dates. On November 7, 1805, the day the party arrived, or so they thought,
in sight of the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> records the event in both journals in terms suggesting immediate emotion.</p>
            <p>The Codex H entry for November 7, however, also contains a passage in quotes
describing the dress of the local Indian women, noting that it was so skimpy that
the "battery of venus is not altogether impervious to the penetrating eye of the
amorite." Not only is the language most unlike <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>, but the whole paragraph
is placed in quotation marks to indicate that it was not <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>. In fact, the whole
paragraph occurs verbatim in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> Codex J entry for March 19, 1806—over
four months after the ostensible date of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> entry. This forces us to conclude
that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote the November 7, 1805, entry in Codex H on or after March 19,
1806. Lacking any indication that the page with the quoted paragraph was inserted later, we must assume that the remainder of Codex H after that date—and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> subsequent notebook journals, largely copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>—were
written on or after March 19, 1806—an assumption that creates some intriguing
problems. <a href="#ngi000051" id="lngi000051" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>There is some evidence, moreover, that much of Codex H before November 7,
1805, was not written until months after the given dates. In the entry in that journal for October 18, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> notes how "the Great Chief and one of the <em class="hi">

inhabitants and tributaries. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> copy of the sketch appears in the middle of
the journal entry as if done at the same time as the entry itself. Yet the map labels as "Clark's River" the <a class="regularization" title="Pend Oreille (Clark's, Flathead, Lastaro, Lastaw) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pend%20Oreille%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%2C%20Lastaro%2C%20Lastaw%29%20River">Pend Oreille River</a> where it enters the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>. There is
good reason to believe that the captains did not decide to give the name Clark's
River to the combined <a class="regularization" title="Bitterroot (Clark's, Flathead) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Bitterroot%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%29%20River">Bitterroot</a>-<a class="regularization" title="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%20Fork%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20East%20Fork%20Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%29%20River">Clark Fork</a>-<a class="regularization" title="Pend Oreille (Clark's, Flathead, Lastaro, Lastaw) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pend%20Oreille%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%2C%20Lastaro%2C%20Lastaw%29%20River">Pend Oreille</a> rivers until between
April 17 and May 6, 1806 (see <em class="hi">Atlas</em>, pp. 10–11). An almost exact duplicate of the
map in another notebook not containing daily entries shows the same stream as
the "Flathead River," the name they used earlier. It may be, then, that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did
not write the October 18 entry until late April or early May of 1806, inserting the
sketch the Indians had given him under the appropriate date by copying from
an earlier version. Codex H begins only a few days before that date, on October
11, 1805, so it might well be that, on finishing Codex G on October 10, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
decided that since they were traveling downstream in canoes, it would be wise to
use the Elkskin-bound Journal for daily journal keeping and keep his notebooks
safely sealed away in boxes. As noted, the elkskin book's entries become increasingly extensive about this time.</p>
            <p>Codex H ends on November 19 with a brief entry and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> words "See another book for perticulars." Codex I takes up with a longer entry for the same
date, but only after thirty-four pages of introductory miscellaneous material—courses and distances from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, including some for a trip
down the coast that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> made in January 1806. That Codex I then takes up the
narrative on November 19, 1805, immediately after this collection of data, suggests that Codex H was finished and the daily entries in Codex I begun in sequence. If so, then <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> also wrote Codex I after March 19, 1806, when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
wrote the "battery of venus" passage, which <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> copied under the date of
November 7, 1805, in Codex H.</p>
            <p>Why, then, did <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wait so long to write this material in the red books? Up to
December 31, 1805, he was writing in the sheets bound in elkskin and may not
have seen any reason to start another journal, or he may not have gotten around
to it. There is no clear evidence of such notes continuing after the first day of
1806. But <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Codex I has three short entries for January 1, 2, and 3 at one
end of the book, upside down to all the rest of the writing in that book, which
starts at the other end. It would seem that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> began Codex I as a continuation
of the Elkskin-bound Journal (ending December 31), then decided to do something else. It appears that he again took up Codex H, filled it up with entries
paralleling the elkskin book through November 19, then continued in sequence
in Codex I; if so, then he evidently did so after March 19, the date of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
observations about the visibility of the "battery of venus." Apparently <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
wrote no journals of which we have knowledge for nearly three months, and this
at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a>, where he would have had relative leisure for writing. Codex I
does contain a detailed record of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> trip down the <a class="regularization" title="Oregon" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Oregon">Oregon</a> coast on January
6–10, taken from notes (here called First Draft, January 6–10, 1806) of the kind
the captains kept on other occasions when separated. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> synopsis of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> trip is in his Codex J for January 10, the day of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> return, and was likely
written at that time from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> verbal account and First Draft notes.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> began a new journal (Codex J) on January 1, 1806, and continued a consistent writing until August 12 when he laid his pen down, ending his record of
the expedition. That is the first journal writing by him, as far as we know, since
August 1805, except for scattered fragments. Perhaps the new journal is another
point of beginning as has been conjectured with Codices Aa, Ba, and Fc, and
here his good intentions of journal keeping (combined perhaps with a New Year's
resolution) were fulfilled. Codex J is a detailed record, to March 20, of life at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort
Clatsop</a>, and contains extensive descriptions of local flora and fauna and the life
of the nearby Indians, with numerous illustrations. Nowhere else did <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> devote
more time to fulfilling the scientific objectives of the expedition by recording so
much. All of the observations are incorporated in the daily entries, generally after
the record of the day's events. In what was evidently an additional measure to
insure the preservation of this material, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> copied most of it into his journals
almost verbatim. For some reason <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did not always copy material under the
same date as <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and sometimes placed it under an entry several days earlier
than that of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>. Clearly he was not copying <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> day by day.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> copying of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> for the period after January 1, 1806, is in a more
careful, neater hand. There is no way of knowing whether <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> neater hand
was something he could do at any time he chose to make the effort, or whether it
represents writing at leisure and in comfort after the return from the voyage.
But if the reason for copying from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was insurance against loss, it would
make more sense to complete it as soon as possible during the journey.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> Codex J also includes natural history material appropriate to the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky
Mountains</a> and Interior Basin, notes additional to the few fragments extant for
that period. If <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had kept a journal for that period (August-December 1805),
why did he copy it into daily entries for the time at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a>? Why not copy it
into a separate journal covering the actual dates? That question must remain a
mystery. There must have been some sort of natural history field notes or other
journals for that period that are now lost. If <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> did have notes in daily journal
form covering the August-December gap, why did he not copy them into his own

the notes he had were mainly natural history and ethnographic material, and that
he did copy them into Codex J, under current dates. If both <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> were
copying from supposed notes made by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> before arriving at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a>, then
it might be clear why <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> version of the scientific material comes under different dates than in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journals, while his daily record of events follows <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
verbatim on the same dates. But <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> duplication of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> natural history notes
in the codices (particularly Codex J) is so exact that the hypothetical notes must

hardly imagine <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> writing over four months' worth of notebook journals,
including extensive natural history notes, in that period of time, which surely
was crowded with preparations for leaving. If he was copying from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> after
the departure from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a>, when did he do it—along the trail, during the
lengthy stopover at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a> in <a class="regularization" title="Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Idaho">Idaho</a>, or after the arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>?
And what did he do about his own daily journalizing during the homeward
journey?</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> copying of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> continues during the first few days of the party's journey up the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>; he was still writing in the same book (Voorhis No. 2 in
Thwaites's numbering system) and the entries could have been written some time
later. The last two days of Voorhis No. 2, April 2 and 3, describe <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> trip up
the <a class="regularization" title="Willamette (Multnomah) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River">Willamette River</a> on those days and could easily have been taken from field
notes. <a href="#ngi000053" id="lngi000053" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> copied that narrative under his April 6 entry, with some changes in
wording. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Voorhis No. 3 begins on April 4 and is more a record of daily
events without the extended descriptions copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>.</p>
            <p>Since Voorhis No. 3 takes up immediately where No. 2 leaves off, however, it
is logical to think that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did not start No. 3 until the other was finished—perhaps some time after the given date. Under April 6, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> again has some
natural history data copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> entry of April 7. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> may have been
keeping some sort of field notes at this time. There are such notes made by him
for the period of April 16–21, but for most of that time the captains were separated, with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> trading for food at various Indian villages near the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls
of the Columbia</a>. He might well have not wanted to be troubled with carrying a
notebook journal at that time, but perhaps he was not keeping a journal at all in
the period of the journey upriver. We have no idea when the two decided that
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> should copy <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a> journals, perhaps doing no journalizing himself in the meantime, although the short entries for January 1–3 in his
Codex I suggest the decision was taken in early January 1806. Nor is it clear how
long after March 19 <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> waited to begin his copying.</p>
            <p>From May 14 to June 10, 1806, the expedition was at rest at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a>, on the north bank of the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater River</a> in the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> country of
<a class="regularization" title="Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Idaho">Idaho</a>, waiting for the snow to melt sufficiently on the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a> for their passage east. In this extended period of relative leisure <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> might have done some
of the extensive copying from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journals. As noted, the use of the name
"Clark's Fork" in a map placed with the October 18, 1805, entry in Codex H suggests that much of that notebook journal was not written until late April or early
May of 1806, or later. That possibility would fit well with the hypothesis that much of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> catching up in his notebook journals and his copying from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
took place at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a> in May and June of 1806. Voorhis No. 3 has on
its flyleaf a list of <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> (<a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a>) names for rivers; that fact suggests
that the book, covering April 4–June 6, 1806, was out of its box and readily available during the period to record the information. Perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> finished his
copying at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a>, although it would have been a substantial task.
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> records events of the period in words very similar to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>, but daily
events could obviously have been copied the day they happened. It is notable,
however, that after the end of May we no longer have passages in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journal
that are clearly copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, placed by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> under dates earlier than in

It is therefore possible that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> copying from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was complete to June 6 and he was
able to start Codex M on the actual date.</p>
            <p>Having returned to <a class="regularization" title="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20%28Travelers%27%20Rest%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29">Travelers' Rest</a>, the captains split the party on July 3, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
going northeast to seek a shorter route to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> southeast to explore the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>. By all previous experience they should each have kept a
journal during the period of separation, especially since they would be covering
territory they had not previously explored. <a href="#ngi000055" id="lngi000055" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Did they keep field notes on the
trail or write in their notebook journals?</p>

               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> Codex L runs to July 4, then resumes after eighteen blank pages with
an entry for July 15; that is the only such unfilled gap in time in a notebook
journal. The fragmentary Codex La (July 3–15) covers that period, and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
probably intended it as the first draft. He probably packed away the notebook
Codex L for safekeeping while traveling through the mountains, then resumed
writing in it on July 15, leaving the blank pages to fill in later from the material in
Codex La. In fact he never got around to that, probably because he quit writing
entirely on August 12, by which date all the writing in Codex L was probably
complete. He probably wrote his account of the violent encounter with the <a class="regularization" title="Blackfeet Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Blackfeet%20Indians">Blackfeet</a> on July 27–28 at least a few days later, after rejoining his party following a
hurried ride across country. He continued Codex L to August 8, after which the
fragmentary Codex Lb covers August 9–12; on the twelfth <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> stopped writing entirely because of discomfort from the accidental gunshot wound inflicted
by <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</a> on August 11. He had rejoined <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> on August 12, and the
latter could now keep a record for the whole party.</p>
            <p>The loose pages constituting Codex Lb were evidently once part of a red notebook found among <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> papers, which bears on its cover the notation "9 to 12 Augt. 1806"; it now contains no expeditionary material. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> evidently began
writing in the book after finishing Codex L, then stopped after a few days because of the pain of his wound. In later years <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> removed those few pages to
use the book for other purposes. Considering the unfilled gap in Codex L, it
appears that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journal keeping ceased entirely on August 12, 1806, and was
then complete as it now stands.</p>

               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> travels after leaving <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> involved several shifts from horseback to canoes and back to horses, but there is little indication that he did not write entries
directly into his notebook journal (Codex M) for much of the period. A fragment
for this period, covering the days July 13–19 and July 24–August 3, consists of
courses and distances for his <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> exploration—July 13 was the day he
left the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">Three Forks of the Missouri</a> headed for the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>. The Codex M
entries for those days are much more extensive than the material in the fragment. The gap in the fragment represents the period when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> party stopped
to build canoes, when there were no courses and distances to be recorded. Codex
M has fairly extensive entries for those days. The Codex M entries through July
23 are in sequence, with no large gaps or crowding; as far as we can tell, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
could either have been keeping that journal day by day, or he could have brought
it up to date to the twenty-third while encamped.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> reached the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, at the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>, on August 3. At
the end of his August 3 entry in Codex M is a passage, over two pages in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
hand, describing the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>, which obviously <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> could not have written
before the captains' reunion on August 12. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> August 4 entry then follows
on the next page without any gap. Unless <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> managed to fit his passage neatly
into a gap left by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, then the subsequent entries by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> must also have been
written after August 12. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> may have written the passage on August 12 before
he stopped writing, but he could also have written it weeks later, after he had
largely recovered from his gunshot wound, even after the arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>.</p>
            <p>In his August 10 entry in Codex M, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> gives a description of a cherry in
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> characteristic technical vocabulary, which is in fact copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
description in Codex Lb for August 12; <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> could not have copied it before
August 12, the date of their reunion. <a href="#ngi000056" id="lngi000056" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> has a lengthy description of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
experiences after their parting, with courses and distances, in his August 12 entry. The day of their reunion was the logical place for that information, but there
is no proof that he actually wrote it on the twelfth. After that narration, however,
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> finishes the entry with the remaining events of August 12, the natural sequence if he had written the entry on that date.</p>
            <p>The last daily entry in Codex M is that of August 14; it breaks off in the middle
and is taken up in Codex N, an unusual procedure for <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. The
entry in Codex M runs into the bottom of a weather table for the month of August 1806, which is complete to the end of the month. It is not clear which was written first, since <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> might have broken off the August 14 entry to leave
space for finishing the weather table already started. Otherwise, we would have
to assume he wrote the August 14 entry after the end of August. Codex N takes
up under the heading of August 15, yet it clearly describes the same Indian
council as that of August 14, in Codex M; the transition from one day to the next
is never clear. Hurried copying at a later date might be the explanation of the
unusual confusion of dates.</p>
            <p>At the end of Codex M, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote an undated "Memorandom" to himself
about some things that needed to be done; among them was to "Copy a Sketch of
the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">rochjhone [Yellowstone]</a>." Under the date of August 10, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> notes that he
"finished a copy of my Sketches of the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">River Rochejhone</a>," which may mean the
memorandum was written before that date. He also notes that he must make "a
copy of the courses and distances," perhaps meaning to copy the fragment giving courses and distances for July 13–19 and July 24–August 3. The last item is
"to fill up [vacinces?] in my book." Those "vacancies" could be merely the various
blanks left in the journals for names of streams decided on later; they could be
portions of pages left blank for insertion of material; or they could be more extensive blank spaces in the notebooks. At any rate, the note emphasizes the uncertainty for scholars of determining when any particular entry or portion of
one was written.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Codex N has several blank spaces at the end of entries, perhaps left for
insertion of extra information in case of need; that provides no satisfactory indication of when the writing was done. Codex N also contains miscellaneous
notes that could have been made at various dates. The first two pages (including
one side of the front flyleaf) are lists of goods shipped from <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> after the
expedition's return, written in the same direction as the journal entries that follow. It is possible, then, that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> wrote the whole of the daily entries in the
book (August 15–September 26) after the latter date. The use of the flyleaf,
however, might be taken as an indication that the list was written after the journal entries. The confusion of dates at the beginning of Codex N, the gaps perhaps left for later insertions, and one instance (August 16–17) where one day's
entry runs over into the beginning of the next, could all be taken as indications
of haste. Such haste, however, could belong either to the period of the final rush
downriver by the homesick explorers, or to the period after the return, when
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> was trying to finish his task. Codex N ends on September 26, three days
after the arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>; the entries are progressively shorter the last few
days, the last two notably so. There is no discernible reason why <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> chose to
end at this particular point rather than on the day of arrival; that would be especially odd if he were copying the material from notes later.</p>
            <p>There is still doubt, then, as to when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> finished his writing. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> statement that "ten or twelve" red books were turned over to him on <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> return is too vague to support any precise conclusions. If <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> showed the president all
his own and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> daily notebook journals—Codices D through N and Voorhis
Nos. 1, 2, and 3, there would be fourteen red books. <a href="#ngi000057" id="lngi000057" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a> That leaves room for some
unfinished journal keeping by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, consisting most probably of Codex N and
part of Codex M if there was any such unfinished work. If <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had delivered
the remaining material on or soon after his own arrival in <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington</a> on January 21, 1807, <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> might not have considered the circumstance memorable
or worth mentioning years later, especially since he always tended to think and
write of the expedition and the journals as essentially <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>.</p>
            <p>The reader may not think the above a substantial advance beyond <a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">David
McKeehan's</a> statement of 1807 that "the several journals were brought together . . . and the blanks . . . filled up . . . at the different resting places." That is the
procedure common sense would suggest, and it accords with the evidence available. In all probability, the bulk of the journals were complete when <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>
saw them, some three months after the end of the expedition. Neither <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>
nor <a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">McKeehan</a> made any specific mention of field notes, but they were certainly
made because some still exist. The possibility remains that the captains made
other field notes and that some of those may yet be found. The evidence, however, does not require us to assume extensive sets of field notes amounting to
duplicate journals covering the whole journey and copied into notebooks during
or after the expedition.</p>
            <p>Neither does the evidence indicate a uniform journal-keeping procedure followed consistently throughout the expedition. The captains followed their own
convenience so far as consistent with making a complete record and with the
safety of the documents themselves. If they had any fixed procedure in mind
when they started out, they were certainly flexible enough to change it in the
light of experience. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> full and extensive Field Notes for the journey up to
<a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> do not prove the existence of such notes for periods when none
have been found. There are good reasons for believing that both captains wrote
parts of their notebook journals later than their given dates, in the case of some
of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journals months later. At other times the evidence suggests that they
kept the notebook journals day by day or soon after the given dates. They may
have written in the notebook journals daily when the going was fairly smooth
and the books were easily transported and protected. Under bad conditions they
probably sealed up the notebooks in tin boxes for safety, using more or less extensive rough notes to keep a daily record.</p>
            <p>The most significant criterion for the use of field notes would be the risk factor. In the beginning, when they were still gaining experience and testing procedures (on the journey to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>), when travel and weather conditions were particularly bad (on the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a>), or during separations (the trip to the whale site on the <a class="regularization" title="Oregon" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Oregon">Oregon</a> coast), we can expect to find field notes with the finished journals.</p>
            <p>The presence of several fragmentary, unbound codices naturally suggests a
comparison with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes of the first year; could they be the remains
of a similar comprehensive set of preliminary journals, the basis of the notebook
journals? The majority of them represent periods when the captains were separated; does this mean that the authors wrote them only because of that circumstance, or was that the reason those notes were preserved while many others
were discarded? None of the fragments gives a clear indication of being part of a
more extensive body of notes. There are no parts of a previous day's entry at the
beginning, nor the beginning of another entry cut off at the bottom of the last
page. In one or two cases the author may have intended to continue but left
blank space indicating he never got around to it. The same appears to be the case
with the Elkskin-bound Journal. The "fragments," as far as the evidence goes,
are complete in themselves and not the remains of something larger. There was
nothing, after all, to prevent the author of each fragment from copying it into his
notebook and then discarding it with the rest of his hypothetical field notes. The
preservation of these scattered pieces is more likely to have been the result of the
captains' desire to preserve everything that could possibly be useful and relevant.
Because so many of the fragments are <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>, they are part of the mysteries surrounding his journal keeping.</p>
            <p>Nine of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> fragmentary codices (Aa, Ba, Fa, Fb, Fc, Fd, Fe, Ia, and Lb) are
apparently pages taken from notebooks, all but one (Ia) from red books. It is
possible that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> removed the pages before writing on them, but it is equally
possible that the writing was done in the books and the pages removed at some
later period. Codex Fc, for instance, came from Codex P, and there is some reason to believe that those pages were not removed until 1810, when the book was
used to copy natural history notes for <a class="regularization" title="Barton, Benjamin Smith" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Barton%2C%20Benjamin%20Smith">Benjamin Smith Barton</a>. As noted, many
of the fragments represent periods when the captains were separated or when
weather and travel conditions posed a special risk to the journals. On such occasions <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> may have used a book that was largely blank, containing perhaps
some relatively unimportant or duplicated data. Thus if the book he was carrying with him was damaged by weather or a dip in a river, or if he failed to return
from a scouting mission, important material would not be lost, as would be the
case if a regular daily journal suffered. This possibility may strengthen the likelihood that the so-called fragments are complete in themselves and not part of a
body of lost field notes. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> reference to the red books as "travelling pocket
journals," although he was not present when they were written, at least suggests
that some of them were at some times carried on the person. Their size renders
this quite possible. The "fragment" pages could have been removed from the books during the expedition, after the return, or when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> were
working on the journals in 1810. If <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> did have daily field notes and did not
get them copied, what happened to them? When they saved so much else—so many fragments, scraps, and sketches—why not save material by the expedition
leader covering periods when there is no other writing by him? Once again we
have hypothetical lost journals, for whose existence there is no real evidence.</p>
            <p>When <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> gave <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</a> custody of the notebook journals in 1810,
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> retained some of his own notebooks, which became part of Thwaites's discovery of material from the Voorhis family. The ones he retained covered periods for which there are known <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> journals. The ones turned over to <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> cover the periods where no <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> journals are known to exist and the long separation in the summer of 1806. It certainly appears that the basis of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> choice
of which of his own books to give <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> was the existence or nonexistence of
journals by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> covering the same period. If so, then the present gaps in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
journals apparently existed by 1810 at the latest, and as noted no letters are known
that lament the loss of daily journals by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, either at the time of his death or
earlier.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Elkskin-bound Journal represents a special case where extra care was
taken to preserve a lengthy body of what evidently started out as rough course
and distance notes with sketch maps made on the spot. But for most of the period covered by that journal there is no known writing by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, and it seems
that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did not write his notebook journals for at least half the period until
months later. Moreover, conditions during the period were often such that the
notebooks would have been safer in their sealed boxes. The Elkskin-bound Journal ends at the very point where <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> known journalizing resumes.</p>
            <p>From the evidence it appears that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> kept no regular journal for almost
three months at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a> (January, February, and March 1806), while <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
was keeping his journal with its extensive notes on natural history and ethnology.
Either they planned all along for <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> to copy those notes or decided on this
precaution at some later point for safety's sake. It is unclear when <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> completed the copying of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a> journals or when he wrote the remainder of his notebook journals—how much he completed on the trail or how much, if any, after reaching <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>. We can only guess how long it took him to
copy from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or to compose his own entries. He introduced many of his own
characteristic spellings into copied material, indicating that he was not trying to
achieve literal faithfulness, and he sometimes changed the wording and included
material from his own experiences where it seemed relevant.</p>
            <p>At points where a notebook journal appears from good evidence to have been
written weeks or months after the given date, it is not unreasonable to suppose
the existence of some sort of field notes to assist memory. The clearest and most
extreme case of the sort, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> notebook journals of fall 1805 to spring 1806 (Codices H and I and Voorhis No. 2), is explained by the existing Elkskin-bound
Journal (from November 1805 to December 31, 1805), and after January 1, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>
copied from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> journals. In cases where the interval between the given date
and the actual writing of the entry was shorter, the notes could have been as extensive as the existing field notes of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> from the first year, or they might have
been in the nature of expanded course and distance notes with sketch maps, of
which various examples remain.</p>
            <p>There is little reason to accept the theory that the red notebook journals were
all written after the return from subsequently discarded field notes. Considering
the great amount of extant material and the labor involved in writing it, we need
not imagine extensive sets of field notes paralleling the notebooks when the existence of such notes is neither known nor required by the evidence. Whatever
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> "we commenced wrighting" in his last journal entry refers to, it was probably not the task of writing all the red books covering a year and a half of travel.
Most of the material we now have was written by the captains in the course of the
expedition. In reading it, we are in a sense traveling with them and sharing their
day-by-day experiences and uncertainties.</p>

the captains were in no doubt about the importance of their written record.
Much of <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> instructions to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> consisted of either detailed lists of
the sort of information they were to record or admonitions about the importance of
making duplicates and preserving their notes against loss. If they could make
contact with some American ship on the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> coast, even if they did not choose
to return by sea, they were to send some trustworthy member of the Corps of
Discovery home by that route with a copy of their journals to date. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>
wanted a full record of their findings to present to the world as soon as possible
in a multivolume work, including a narrative of the journey and a full exposition
of their scientific and geographic discoveries, with appropriate maps and illustrations. The published accounts of <a class="regularization" title="Cook, James" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cook%2C%20James">Captain Cook's</a> voyages and the journals of
American naturalist <a class="regularization" title="Bartram, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bartram%2C%20William">William Bartram</a> probably provided models of what <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> had in mind. Certainly he did not intend to have the journals published in
their original, rough form; the convention of the time demanded that someone
should produce a polished, literary version. <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> intended that <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, who

For all his good intentions, <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> himself was responsible for many of the initial delays, for he promptly appointed <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> to
official positions that prevented their devoting their time to preparing the journals for publication. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> he nominated as governor of the upper portion of

Indian affairs for the same region. The country needed men of knowledge and
ability in those positions, and on the face of it no two were better qualified. Yet
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> appointment would prove disastrous for him.</p>

prospective readers. According to the prospectus issued in April 1807, the first
volume would be a narrative of the journey, the second would present the geography and "a view of the Indian Nations," and the third would give the scientific
results.

him to despair. In October 1809, on a journey to <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington</a> to straighten out

journal in 1807. To supplement their own records, the captains had required the
sergeants to keep journals, and others kept records as well; those journals will
be discussed in another part of this volume, and existing journals will appear in
this edition. <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> had no permission to publish, and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was somewhat vexed
at the sergeant's enterprise. Lacking any literary pretensions, <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> had his journal worked over by <a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">David McKeehan</a>, who produced a heavily edited volume, probably quite unlike the original. <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> could add little to the scientific results, and the <a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">McKeehan</a> text scrupulously avoids mentioning personal names and

               <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> had always thought of the journey as essentially <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>; <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> function was to second the commander and take over if anything happened to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>.
No such necessity arose during the expedition, but after <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> personal disaster, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did indeed have to take over and finish their joint task, now in a phase
for which he considered himself little qualified. We might have expected that
<a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>, having left the presidency in 1809, would have had the time, as he certainly had the qualifications, to prepare the work for publication himself, but there is no evidence that he ever considered it, although he maintained his interest in its progress.</p>
            <p>With <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> death, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> became custodian of the captains' journals, and
to him fell the duty of preparing the narrative account of the expedition. Unsure
of his own literary abilities, he turned to <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</a>, a literary figure of <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>. Reluctant at first to accept the task, <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> eventually acquiesced and
agreed to visit <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> at <a class="regularization" title="Fincastle, Va." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fincastle%2C%20Va.">Fincastle</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Virginia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Virginia">Virginia</a>, the family home of <a class="regularization" title="Hancock, Julia" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hancock%2C%20Julia">Julia Hancock</a>

There <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> spent about three weeks in the spring
of 1810, learning about the expedition and poring over the journals. <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> took
copious notes in partially filled and unused notebooks from the expedition. His
task was to write an account of the trip while leaving scientific matters to others.
<a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> had full use of the captains' journals at that time and <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Sergeant John Ordway's</a> journal as well, and took most of them with him. Later in <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a> he had the personal assistance of <a class="regularization" title="Shannon, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George">George Shannon</a>, a private in the party. <a href="#ngi000062" id="lngi000062" class="ref_link"><sup>[62]</sup></a>

The failure of
<a class="regularization" title="Conrad, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Conrad%2C%20John">John Conrad's</a> publishing business in 1812 further delayed publication. In 1813,
<a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> made arrangements with another <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a> firm, Bradford and Inskeep, and also turned the work over to <a class="regularization" title="Allen, Paul" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Allen%2C%20Paul">Paul Allen</a> for final revision. Although <a class="regularization" title="Allen, Paul" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Allen%2C%20Paul">Allen's</a> contribution was secondary, his name was the only one to appear on the
title page as author. <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> probably followed a literary convention of the time
that a gentleman did not publish under his own name, if he did not earn a living
by writing. Indeed, <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> received not a cent for his work; neither did <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>,
for Bradford and Inskeep also went into bankruptcy in 1814, the year of publication of <em class="hi">History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>.</em>
Only 2,000 sets were printed. Two years after publication, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> himself was still

Many readers believed that in it they were reading the actual journals of the captains. <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> was scrupulous about accuracy, taking care to question <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> on innumerable points. He had not traveled in the West, and he could not have known the country as the
captains did. Because of a personal interest in ethnology, he included much of
the wealth of information to be gleaned from the journals about native peoples. Certainly his care, together with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> map of the West published with it (<em class="hi">Atlas</em>

Before his death, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had
discussed his intended publication with <a class="regularization" title="Barton, Benjamin Smith" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Barton%2C%20Benjamin%20Smith">Barton</a> and had perhaps asked him to
write the scientific volume—chiefly those parts concerned with natural history.
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> made a similar arrangement with <a class="regularization" title="Barton, Benjamin Smith" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Barton%2C%20Benjamin%20Smith">Barton</a> in 1810 and had the natural history notes in the daily-entry journals copied into other notebooks for the naturalist. Because of <a class="regularization" title="Barton, Benjamin Smith" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Barton%2C%20Benjamin%20Smith">Barton's</a> age and failing health, and perhaps his procrastination, no volume on the scientific achievements of the expedition ever appeared. <a href="#ngi000064" id="lngi000064" class="ref_link"><sup>[64]</sup></a>

            <p>After <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> had deposited the journals with the American
Philosophical Society in 1817 and 1818, the volumes rested virtually untouched
for some seventy-five years, and <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> history remained their only representation to the world. Yet the <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> paraphrase was by no means all that <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>
had hoped; in particular, the omission of the scientific findings helped establish a
view of the expedition, common to this day, as primarily a romantic adventure.
That conception was altered largely through the work of one man of large scientific achievements and with an unassailable conviction of the correctness of his
own views. Elliott Coues became the next editor of the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> documents and in his work illuminated the numerous scientific discoveries of the captains. Moreover, he codified the society's expedition documents under a reference system that is in use to this day. Although Coues was to become one of the
most notable editors of western historical documents, his professional training
was in quite different fields. He had served for eighteen years as an army surgeon,
but his great interest was in birds, and he had become the leading American ornithologist of his day. His military duties took him to various regions traversed by
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, so that, unlike <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a>, he had firsthand knowledge of the West.
He came to the editing task in 1891 when publisher Francis P. Harper sought
someone to prepare a new edition of <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> history. <a href="#ngi000065" id="lngi000065" class="ref_link"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In a sense, Coues rediscovered the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> manuscripts that had been
deposited by <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> with the American Philosophical Society in
1817 and 1818. Since that time the journals had hardly been touched, and although they were not lost, they were certainly little known. Society records demonstrate that while the journals rested securely in the archives between <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> and Coues's time there were a number of applications for their use. In 1837, Secretary of War Joel Poinsett asked the society to loan the journals to John James
Audubon, who wished to prepare a natural history of the expedition. Audubon
was then in Europe, and it was decided not to risk the journals to an ocean voyage, but the society offered full use of them at <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>. In 1884, the society published its minutes up to 1838, which revealed to readers that the journals were in its keeping. During the next few years, ethnologists Daniel G. Brinton
and Henry Henshaw and geographer Alfred J. Hill inquired about the manuscripts. But it was Coues who rekindled the nation's interest in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. <a href="#ngi000066" id="lngi000066" class="ref_link"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>During the Christmas season of 1892, Coues began to examine the manuscript journals in the study of his home at 1726 N Street, <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, having been loaned the documents to prepare his edition of <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> work. Coues was unawed by these original notebooks, for he quickly began to set them in
order for easy reference and to tamper with them in a shameless fashion. He
removed their brass holding clasps; he reordered and covered loose pages and
set them in chronological sequence; and he labeled each notebook and paginated
the lot. He even made a secret copy of the whole without the knowledge or consent of the society. Moreover, he added numerous and sometimes long interlinear notations and trimmed several ragged pages. For those reasons, despite
their admiration for Coues's edition (his annotation was a magnificent addition to
<a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> work), scholars have been critical of the doctor. <a href="#ngi000067" id="lngi000067" class="ref_link"><sup>[67]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Not all that Coues did to the journals, however, should be considered detrimental. His labeling, reordering, and paging of the notebooks and loose papers
provide a practical way of cataloging and referring to the journals. Besides designating the notebooks as codices and setting them in chronological order, Coues
wrote out a lengthy description of the journals' contents—noting maps, drawings, figures, and tables—and discussed the authorship and disposition of each
journal. All that work is very helpful, although it does not excuse his defacing of
the manuscripts. <a href="#ngi000068" id="lngi000068" class="ref_link"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Coues's 1893 edition of <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a>
               <em class="hi">History</em> was in many ways a masterly work. He
was able to identify many of the plants and animals mentioned and to locate
many geographical points. With the aid of the journals, he elucidated many of
<a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> obscure passages, adding extensive supplementary quotes from the
journals. Coues was a champion of the footnote, undaunted by problems of
space; his notes come close to outrunning <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> text, and he was willing to alter <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> language when quoting from the journals. He seldom
hesitated to interject his own opinions or information, whether or not it was relevant to the subject; in particular, he could not refrain from mentioning if he had
visited points passed by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, and he seldom admitted doubt on any
point if he could possibly avoid it. Nonetheless, his editorial work was a major
contribution to the knowledge of the expedition. <a href="#ngi000069" id="lngi000069" class="ref_link"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Coues evidently made his secret copy of the journals in anticipation of editing
them for publication himself, but other work and his early death in 1899 prevented this. <a href="#ngi000070" id="lngi000070" class="ref_link"><sup>[70]</sup></a> Instead, the job fell to Reuben Gold Thwaites, who undertook the
task for the publishing firm of Dodd, Mead and Company in 1901. Thwaites,

against including <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> journal because he considered it easily available elsewhere.

            <p>Thwaites's work would surely have satisfied <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a>. All scientific material
was included as well as the maps found in the Voorhis Collection. He also printed
a number of the letters from the collection in an appendix. Yet Thwaites labored
under certain handicaps of space and time and lacked the broad geographic and
scientific knowledge that Coues brought to his work. Errors of transcription
slipped by, and his organization of materials is open to criticism in some respects.
By the standards of a later generation, his annotation was meager and somewhat
erratic; he borrowed from Coues's footnotes and supplemented them with help
from other scientists and his own knowledge of western history. The deficiencies
of his work demonstrate both the increasing intellectual specialization and the
amount of scholarship that remained to be done on the expedition. Nonetheless,
Thwaites made available to the world for the first time the bulk of the captains'
and their subordinates' journals, more or less as the authors had prepared them.
It was his work that made possible the subsequent generations of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> scholarship that have finally rendered a new edition necessary. <a href="#ngi000072" id="lngi000072" class="ref_link"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Thwaites thought he had probably uncovered all the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> material
still in existence, but within a decade of his edition, new documents became available.

Thwaites had known that <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> had kept a journal and had been searching for it when he discovered the Voorhis journals, but the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> document—here called
the Eastern Journal—was a totally unexpected discovery, for no one had suspected that any notes were kept on this initial phase of the trip. The editorial
work on <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> journal and the Eastern Journal went to Milo Milton Quaife,
Thwaites's successor at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. Quaife was a
professional historian, though at the time he took the job he lacked the editorial
experience of both Coues and Thwaites, and the scientific and geographic knowledge of Coues. He carefully compared <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> account with those of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>,

He restrained himself in annotation, unlike Coues,
and most of his notes relate to geography; however, he has been criticized for his
dearth of annotation. <a href="#ngi000073" id="lngi000073" class="ref_link"><sup>[73]</sup></a>

have been expected, if they were in existence. In 1953, however, a major find came
to light under totally unexpected circumstances. In <a class="regularization" title="Saint Paul, Minn." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minn.">St. Paul, Minnesota</a>, Lucile M.
Kane, curator of manuscripts for the Minnesota Historical Society, inspected the
papers stored in an old desk of General John Henry Hammond, who had died in
1890. One bundle of papers, wrapped in a <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> newspaper, proved
to be sixty-seven sheets of field notes written by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">William Clark</a> in 1804 and 1805,
with some interpolations by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>. Portions of them cover the winter at <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River
Dubois</a>, about which little was previously known. The rest consist of preliminary
notes for the period May 14, 1804–April 13, 1805, though entries are less frequent
after November 1804. The first group of papers has been called the Dubois Journal while the second set has been labeled the River Journal. Thwaites had suspected that such notes were made, then copied and expanded in the regular
notebooks at some subsequent time that he could not determine, and the new
find confirmed his surmise, at least for the period of the River Journal. <a href="#ngi000074" id="lngi000074" class="ref_link"><sup>[74]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Ernest Staples Osgood, an experienced historian of the West, became editor of
the Field Notes, but litigation over the ownership of the documents interrupted
his work. The heirs of Hammond's estate eventually regained control of the papers from the Minnesota Historical Society and sold them. The final private
owners, Frederick W. Beinecke and family, ultimately donated them to Yale University where they remain today. Osgood then concluded his editing of the papers and his book was published in 1964 by Yale University Press. Osgood's work
is in many ways the best in the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> story to date. In annotating the
Dubois Journal, he was able to illuminate a period hitherto largely obscure; the
portions dealing with the actual journey to <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, though covering more
familiar events, provided much useful supplementary knowledge. Osgood devoted a lengthy introduction to the many problems of the origin and history of
the documents and provided facsimiles so that readers could make their own
comparisons. <a href="#ngi000075" id="lngi000075" class="ref_link"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The need for a new edition of the journals has been apparent for some time.
The number of discoveries of new journals and the nature of modern editorial
techniques have made Thwaites's edition somewhat obsolete. In fact, Thwaites
did not publish everything that was available in his day, for he omitted some miscellaneous material in the Voorhis Collection, and he did not include <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> journal in his volumes since it was accessible at the time. Quaife also neglected to publish everything that came in with the <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle</a> family deposit but concentrated instead on the two outstanding finds, the Eastern Journal and <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> Journal.
Those items and other overlooked material will be in this edition. More recently
discovered material is also available here for the first time, most important,
<a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse's</a> paraphrased journal, discovered in 1966, which extends the
available portion of the original. Moreover, the difficulty of obtaining some published material today (especially Quaife's and Osgood's works) has increased the
need for this edition. Considering Thwaites's gaps, slight as they are, we can say
that this is the first comprehensive, collated edition of all known journals.</p>
            <p>The principal goal of the new edition is to present users with a reliable, definitive text. The aim is to approach Coues's unfulfilled ambition of creating a text
that is "verbatim et literatim et punctuatim." Earlier editors, pressed for time and
working virtually alone, were not so fortunate as to have several reviews by different persons of their transcriptions. Every effort is being made here to present
a transcript that is nearly identical to the original.</p>
            <p>The new edition will also give readers a thorough, uniform annotation of the
journals. Previous editors, at least until Osgood, have relied largely on the work of
Coues in his annotation of <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Biddle's</a> paraphrased edition of 1814 or have not annotated as thoroughly as present users wish. Scholars have been particularly struck
by the paucity of notes in Thwaites's edition. With the publication of Osgood's
work in 1964, it became clear how antiquated previous editions were. Osgood
had considerable editing skills, but he also benefited from the great amount of
twentieth-century scholarship on <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. He was especially aided by
the publication in 1962 of Jackson's edition of expeditionary correspondence,
which had actually created a surge of new scholarship. Since Osgood's work covers
only a portion of the trip (through the winter of 1804–5) and only a small part of
the writing for that time (<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes), the additional writing and the
long, interesting segment from April 1805 to September 1806 is largely fallow
ground, to be worked here for the first time with modern annotation. A full discussion of the transcribing policies and the annotating guidelines adopted for
this edition is given in the following section, Editorial Procedures. We hope that
the new edition will foster a broader knowledge and spark a new enthusiasm for
the expedition, its courageous members, and its accomplishments.</p>

indicating that he wrote those individual entries after the two reunited. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> explained
his procedure in the latter instance, for on June 23 he wrote, "I shall on each day give the
occurences of both camps during our seperation as I afterwards learnt those of the lower
camp from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a>." He continued this practice until they reunited on July 1. Without saying so, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> apparently continued the practice while separated from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, July
10–13, 15–16, 18–22, and 23–27, 1805. For periods when he was scouting ahead in July
1805, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> gives the courses and distances of the main party in Codex G, presumably
copying from <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> at some time after their reunion. Courses and distances are given in
blocks of several days, interspersed with several days' narrative entries, in a way that suggests <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> went ahead in Codex G to write them, leaving space to fill in the narrative
material. The latter narrates only his own movements, and he may have written them
within a few days of their occurrence. (<a href="#lngi000045">back</a>)</div>

In addition, in his
own May 10, 1805 entry in Voorhis No. 1, he inserted a note: "The Mule Deer Described
in No. 8." Today's Voorhis No. 2 was apparently Number 8 in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> original numbering
