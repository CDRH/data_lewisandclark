         <p>In early June 1805, as they traveled up the Missouri toward the continental divide, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis </span>and William <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came to a fork where two rivers of apparently comparable width and force flowed together. The captains paused at this junction, unable to decide which river was the "main stream" of the Missouri and which was the tributary. They were determined to fulfill <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>'s instructions as exactly as possible: "to explore the Missouri river, &amp; such principal stream of it, as, by it's course and communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean . . . may offer the most direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0101" id="lnlc.belyea.0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Punctilious to a fault, the captains interpreted this mandate narrowly: for them this order meant following the Missouri itself to its source, where a portage across the continental divide would lead to the Columbia watershed, a pattern that would mirror the upper Missouri and flow west to the sea. After nine days of reconnaissance, they decided that the river approaching them from the southwest should be declared the Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> named the other river Marias, and called it one of the Missouri's "most interesting branc[h]es."  <a href="#nlc.belyea.0102" id="lnlc.belyea.0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

         <p>The days of observation and definition at the Missouri/Marias confluence exemplify the survey work to which <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and contemporary European explorers were committed. All were field agents in a larger process of scientific classification by which "unknown" regions of the earth were mapped and described. But as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> moved west across the North American continent, their contact with Native informants revealed spatial and topographical concepts at variance with their own. Native geographical knowledge was not simply sketchy, provisional information that scientific survey could confirm, correct, or supersede.</p>

         <h4>History of the  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition</h4>
         <p>Historians of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition have been accepting and uncritical of the captains' mandate and what they achieved. In 1952 <span class="tei_name">Bernard DeVoto</span> praised expedition members as heroes because "they had filled out the map" and had pursued "scientific objectives" during two years of hardships, dangers, and adventures. Specifically, <span class="tei_name">DeVoto</span> called the Missouri/Marias decision "a remarkable act of the mind [that] must be conceded a distinguished place in the history of thought. It is the basic method of science." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0103" id="lnlc.belyea.0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> More than twenty years later, <span class="tei_name">John Logan Allen</span> contrasted <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> field surveys with earlier geographical "lore" gleaned from speculative cartography and "sketchy native data." In <span class="italic">Passage Through the Garden</span>, published in 1975, <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> considers the expedition leaders to have been "a pair of trained and intelligent observers [who] gathered and analyzed geographical information in what can only be described as a scientific method." <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> echoes <span class="tei_name">De Voto</span> in calling the decision at the Marias "a brilliant piece of deduction from a fuzzy set of facts [that] illustrates . . . the competence and intelligence of its commanders." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0104" id="lnlc.belyea.0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> In a complementary work published within a few years of <span class="italic">Passage Through the Garden</span>, <span class="tei_name">Paul Russell Cutright</span> established <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as "pioneering naturalists" who charted flora and fauna according to Linnaean categories. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0105" id="lnlc.belyea.0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Although <span class="tei_name">James P. Ronda</span>'s studies of the expedition's contact with Native groups have tempered earlier interpretations of the captains' success, <span class="tei_name">Ronda</span> continues to see the expedition as a scientific breakthrough and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as mastering not only European cartographic skills but those of Native mapping. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0106" id="lnlc.belyea.0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Gary E. Moulton</span>'s recent re-edition of the expedition's journals and maps praises the captains' science and specifically endorses <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>'s account of the decision at the Marias. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0107" id="lnlc.belyea.0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Without exception, the captains' reasoning at the Missouri/Marias junction has been admired as characteristic of the expedition's scientific achievement.</p>
         <p>The expedition's mapping procedures are of particular interest in understanding the problem facing <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> at the Missouri/Marias junction. These procedures are described and judged within a geographical context clearly outlined in <span class="italic">Passage Through the Garden</span>. <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> suggests a progressive shift from the hearsay of Natives and traders, to speculative mapping, and finally to scientific geography:</p>
         <p>There are really three ways of knowing about areas geographically: a system of coherent knowledge based on accurate data and long acquaintance, a system of more or less coherent knowledge based on simple logical and theoretical constructions, or a system which is largely incoherent and based on desires, ambitions, long-standing myths and traditions, or pure rumor and fantasy. . . . The captains [<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>] would replace conjecture and speculation, wild reasonings of theoretical and logical frameworks, with scientific observation. They would fill in many blank spaces on the maps of the Northwest with facts recorded and verified rather than guessed at or hoped for. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0108" id="lnlc.belyea.0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>'s progression, rather confusingly presented in reverse order, is to be understood as three levels of geographical knowledge ranging from the least reliable ("desires, ambitions ... myths and traditions, . . . rumor and fantasy") to logical deduction ("more or less coherent . . . theoretical constructions") to field survey ("accurate data and long acquaintance ... scientific observation"). The captains' job was to replace the first two levels, inherited from Native "lore" and earlier maps, with the third. This process of discovery separated <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> from "lesser men and less capable explorers." As the captains ventured beyond the lower Missouri, "from an area . . . actually well known into one ... less known (in a real or empirical sense)," they found themselves in the frontier region of speculative cartography, faced with inadequate "data" and obliged to replace this reported knowledge with their own observations. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0109" id="lnlc.belyea.0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The three-step progression can be reduced to "two kinds of geographical knowledge":</p>
         <p>The first is "real knowledge," or actual information obtained through active commercial, diplomatic, military, or scholarly enterprises or from the accounts of travelers and observers, evaluated in the light of what is presently accepted as geographical reality. The second and more important kind of knowledge is "perceived knowledge," or lore which is evaluated on the basis of accuracy as it is understood by the explorers themselves. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0110" id="lnlc.belyea.0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>"Real knowledge" was gathered from official European and American sources; "perceived knowledge" was based on fur-trade and Native reports. "Real knowledge" was confirmed by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> during their expedition; "perceived knowledge," though "more important" to the explorers themselves, was replaced by the captains' "field operations." Thus the process of discovery is that by which "invented geography is perceived as real until proven unreal by exploration and observation." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0111" id="lnlc.belyea.0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> In defining the achievement of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> maintains a distinction that has become a tradition in histories of the expedition. "What is presently accepted as geographical reality" quickly loses its tentative quality, and becomes simply "reality," as the expedition's "actual observations" are set against "myths ... traditions . . . rumor . . . conjecture and speculation." Specifically, <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> categorizes Native contributions to "geographical lore" as different in kind from the contribution of "capable explorers" such as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>.</p>
         <p>Like <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>, <span class="tei_name">Warren Heckrotte</span> has studied the map sources of the expedition's geographical knowledge. <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> is more aware than <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> of the complexity of the map compilations consulted by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, but, he too defines the captains' achievement at the Missouri/Marias junction as a triumph of science: "these critical few days in the expedition can stand as the mark where the conjectures of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> and <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> were swept aside and replaced by accurate factual detail." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0112" id="lnlc.belyea.0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Thus, although the expedition's enduring achievement was political, historians have followed <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s lead; to fellow Americans and foreign diplomats alike, the US president promoted the venture as a scientific investigation. Paraphrasing his instructions to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> three years before, he announced to Congress in 1806 that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had "traced the Missouri nearly to it's source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean, ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across our continent, [and] learnt the character of the country ..."  <a href="#nlc.belyea.0113" id="lnlc.belyea.0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>

         <h4>
            <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as Scientific Observers</h4>
         <p>As scientific observers, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were provided with instruments, manuals, blank tables, base maps, and questionnaires that determined objects worthy of note, the categories of their inscription, and the standards by which they would be evaluated. The captains' instruments were far from "crude and unreliable," as <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span> maintains: <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were as well equipped as any contemporary surveyors working on the British Ordnance Survey or on <span class="tei_name">Napoleon</span>'s map of Egypt. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0114" id="lnlc.belyea.0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The scientific categories of their enquiry were inherited from the Royal Society in London, reinforced by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s connections with the Académie des Sciences in Paris, and specifically suggested by members of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. The overland expedition was vaguely imitative of the voyages of <span class="tei_name">Cook</span> and <span class="tei_name">Vancouver</span>, but <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> saw a closer model for his project in the fur trade opportunist <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span>. The trader's record of his transcontinental crossing, published in 1801, was well received in scientific circles despite his ignorance of botany and his shaky surveying skills. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0115" id="lnlc.belyea.0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Like <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>'s venture, but in contrast to the British maritime voyages, the American expedition would not include trained scientists. Observations taken and specimens collected would be handed over to experts on the expedition's return. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s acknowledgment that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was not "regularly educated" tends to be overlooked in most recent histories of the expedition, as it was by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> himself. The president's former secretary assured a future reading public that he and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could provide "accurate information" on the geography, mineralogy, botany, and zoology of the trans–Mississippi West—despite inconclusive astronomical observations, uncatalogued biological collections, and years of delay in publishing any account of the western "tour." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0116" id="lnlc.belyea.0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Whatever the proven level of their accomplishment, both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> aspired to scientific discovery and subscribed to the aims and biases of contemporary empirical investigation. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s previous training and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s crash course in surveying ensured that their maps would be based on route traverses confirmed by astronomical observations and would be drawn according to European cartographic convention. But as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> filled in blanks of their tables and base maps, both leaders were constrained as much as empowered by the disciplines and concerns they were representing in the field. Even <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s landscape descriptions drew on a standardized vocabulary of the picturesque, and the expedition's scientific records were equally reflective of prescribed ways of seeing. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0117" id="lnlc.belyea.0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>The choice point at the Marias demonstrates the way in which <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> operated within a network of scientific investigation, analysis, and interpretation that dictated what routes they selected and what they observed. Only partial, provisional assimilation of Native mapping was possible or desirable; instead explorers of the western interior attempted to make foreign knowledge comply with their own aims and categories. When they asked leading questions, tried to copy Native relief maps onto the flat pages of their notebooks, and failed to record the dialogue and gestures that were integral aspects of this transmission of knowledge, they reduced indigenous maps to isolated, poorly grasped details to be inserted into their own geographical images. The price of such assimilation was destruction of the integrity, and on many occasions the sense, of Native maps. Indigenous cartography has to be understood as providing (for its Native users) a complete, efficient geographical notation, not merely crude sketches from which (in the view of non-Native users) essential features are missing or expressed in odd ways. Native mapping challenges us to regard scientific geography in relative terms—to admit that all geographies are "conceptual" rather than "actual," imposed on rather than inherent in the landforms they describe. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0118" id="lnlc.belyea.0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The nine days of indecision at the Marias illustrate the conflict between the captains' loyalty to scientific mapping and their simultaneous recognition that their own base maps were confusing and misleading. The reason for confusion at this point is more specific than the discovery process of replacing "lore" with "actual observations" that <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> outlines. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were trying to locate Native landmarks on a map that represented several earlier stages of assimilation of Native "information."</p>
         <p>When they set out from Fort Mandan in the spring of 1805, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> apparently took with them a copy of <span class="tei_name">Aaron Arrowsmith</span>'s <span class="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries in the Interior Parts of North America . . . Additions to 1802</span>. Although <span class="tei_name">Nicholas King</span>'s map of the West had been commissioned for the expedition in 1803, and although it shows, in <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>'s words, "enough differences . . . to suggest that <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s representation of the Northwest was not evaluated as the best available without some reservations," there is no record in the journals of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that they ever consulted <span class="tei_name">King</span>'s map in the field. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0119" id="lnlc.belyea.0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> The captains would appear to have chosen a faulty <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> map over <span class="tei_name">King</span>'s improved version. <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> offers no explanation for this curious discrepancy. An answer might be found in the map's complex publication history, of which <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> seems unaware. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0120" id="lnlc.belyea.0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> refers to two versions of the <span class="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries</span>: the original issue dated 1795, and "a revision of the 1795 map . . . published in 1802," and provides illustrations for both in his book. Unfortunately, his illustration of the "1795 map" is not of the original first state but of its fourth state, dated 1796, watermarked 1798 and published no earlier than 1799. In any case, both of the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> maps referred to in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s pre-expeditionary correspondence are to be understood as the "Additions to 1802." One of these served as <span class="tei_name">King</span>'s base map; the other was purchased in June 1803 and is likely the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> map that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> carried with him. What <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> does not explain is that the Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries . . . Additions to 1802 exists in two versions, a first issue (the fifth state of the map), which came out early in 1802, and a second issue (the sixth state), which could not have appeared until the last weeks of 1802 or early in 1803. <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> argues conclusively that <span class="tei_name">King</span> used the first issue dated 1802 as his base map, less convincingly that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> carried another copy of the first issue with them. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0121" id="lnlc.belyea.0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> But the captains' reliance on <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> rather than <span class="tei_name">King</span> might be explained by the purchase, in June 1803, of a very recent update, easily recognized as such by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Albert Gallatin</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, all of whom had studied the first issue carefully—the purchase, in other words, of the second issue dated 1802 (the sixth state).
</p>
         <p>Also indicative of the captains' prior knowledge of the upper Missouri is <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s own map drawn at Fort Mandan. During the winter of 1804–05, descriptions and maps furnished by traders and Native leaders had supplemented and in some instances modified the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>/<span class="tei_name">King</span> picture. As <span class="tei_name">Anne Godlewska</span> points out in her study of the contemporary Napoleonic survey of Egypt, map compilations provided "information of varied nature and quality" in a single image; elements from manysources were selected, rationalized, and transformed to fit the purpose, projection, and conventional detail of the composite map under construction. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0122" id="lnlc.belyea.0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>As they headed west from the Great Bend, the captains reviewed the pattern of tributaries that the British cartographer had drawn to represent the upper Missouri and compared it once again with Native landmarks they had learned about at Fort Mandan. Prominent on <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s map drawn during the winter of 1804–05 is the north branch of the Missouri and its tributary, copied from <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> and called by "the Indians . . . the River which scolds at all others." <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> visitors to the fort had also told them that farther upstream, close to the continental divide, they would pass a series of falls and come to a division of the Missouri into three tributary forks. Two cartographic conventions can be seen in uneasy alliance on the maps that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> consulted and produced. The European scientific convention, featuring precise location on an astronomical grid, is made up of what <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span> calls "actual observations"; the Native convention is more or less assimilated into the scientific convention and appears as a swath of reported, unverified details bordering the blank space of the West. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0123" id="lnlc.belyea.0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Hesitating at the Missouri/Marias junction, "examining [their] maps," the captains tried to rationalize imperfectly assimilated details from their Native informants with their scientifically authorized image of the western interior. The long pause at the Marias, maintains <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>, was due to "the failure of the Indians to mention the outliers of the Rockies or to tell them about the Marias River." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0124" id="lnlc.belyea.0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Just as plausibly, it was due to the captains' failure to understand the cartographic image of the upper Missouri that <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>s had presented to them. At any rate, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> continued their efforts to rationalize Native and scientific geographies: they looked for Native landmarks above the Marias, and they tried to fit these into a topographical scheme inherited from European mapping.</p>

        <div class="section  tei_div">
         <h4>
The "True Genuine Missouri"
</h4>
         <p>We can pause here with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, weighing their decision. The captains were convinced that the watershed portage they sought lay at or very near the source of the "true genuine Missouri." They had passed the south branch and the "River which scolds at all others," both of which their informants at Fort Mandan had described; now they were looking out for the great falls. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0125" id="lnlc.belyea.0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s route maps show the Marias as a smaller river flowing into the larger Missouri but widening considerably at its entrance into the main stream. The captains had not anticipated a river flowing from the northwest, muddy like the lower Missouri, swollen with runoff so that it was a considerable size: an unexpected river that cast doubt on the identity of the others they had already passed. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0126" id="lnlc.belyea.0126" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Nonplussed, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> spread out their most authoritative reference, the one in which they invested the greatest faith: they consulted <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>.
</p>
         <p>The <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> map seemed worthy of the captains' confidence because it showed the recent explorations of Peter <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>, a Hudson's Bay Company surveyor who had wintered with a <span class="tei_name">Peigan</span> band along the front ranges of the Rockies in 1792–93 and who had supplied the British cartographer with information about the upper Missouri. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were prepared to believe the findings of a fellow observer in the field; moreover, the second issue dated 1802 (if this is the one they carried) provided names for all of the Missouri's mountain tributaries. The two American leaders assumed that the Missouri as charted on <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s map was derived from <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s own surveys, but they could not identify the mysterious river from the northwest in <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s depiction of the watershed. When they were faced with the uncharted, unexpected river, they felt obliged to discount the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> representation of the Missouri watershed and to doubt <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s "varacity." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0127" id="lnlc.belyea.0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Instead they chose to believe Native accounts of the upper Missouri over <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s representation of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s reports, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s discovery of the great falls on the ninth day of their investigation confirmed this choice. <span class="tei_name">Ronda</span> points out that "despite misunderstandings about the identity of the Marias River, . . . the Indians' information proved not only accurate but invaluable." <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>, on the other hand, qualifies the advice offered by <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>s as "sketchy native data," concluding that "their [the captains] estimation of the accuracy of their [the Native informants'] data was excessive." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0128" id="lnlc.belyea.0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> themselves, and historians ever since, have considered the decision at the Marias as having a purely scientific importance: it was grounded in the logic of the "main stream" and the mountain portage of their instructions. Since the captains were following the Missouri to its source, since the Missouri was said to have its source in the Rocky Mountains, and since the southwest fork was without the turbidity that betrayed a long course through the prairies, therefore the river from the southwest was the Missouri and the other must be a tributary that might or might not originate as a mountain stream. <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> suggests that by this point in the journey <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were demonstrating "a growing ability . . . to differentiate between the geography as it had been imagined . . . and the geography as it actually was." <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span> supports <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>'s interpretation: "the captains' keen geographic intuition led them to distinguish correctly between the Marias and Missouri rivers. More than a week's worth of investigation at the rivers' confluence proved the leaders correct." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0129" id="lnlc.belyea.0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> No change of method; ultimately no challenge to science. According to <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> and <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span>, the captains were "correct" because they discerned the Missouri watershed pattern "as it actually was."</p>

         <h4>Conventions of Representing Watersheds</h4>
         <p>In preferring to emphasize field observation rather than the explorers' declared faith in Native directions, <a href="#nlc.belyea.0130" id="lnlc.belyea.0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> and <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span> remain loyal to the empirical axioms that dictated the expedition's choices and evaluated its discoveries. But the captains did not simply progress from "conjecture and speculation" to proof by field observation. Instead they rejected the details of <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s Missouri in favor of the details provided by their Native informants. At the same time, they continued to adhere to the pattern of the Missouri that <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> had suggested. As <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> himself admits of the expedition's geographical understanding generally, though not of its cartography, "the strength of a preconception .. . allowed [<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>] to diminish, in their assessments of the region, those features of the western environment which did not match the pre-exploratory image." The expedition leaders' preconceptions included not only the shapes and functions of geographical features, such as mountains and rivers, but also their cartographic notation. The captains did not perceive the Missouri watershed "as it actually was" but as it was scientifically represented on authoritative maps: they identified the stream they saw before them by matching it with the pattern of flow and drainage according to which river systems were imaged/imagined in European cartography. <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> summarizes the conception of the Missouri that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived at during the winter at Fort Mandan:</p>
         <p>three major channels were understood as funneling the waters of the mountains into the Missouri system. The southern reaches of the farther West were drained by the Yellowstone ... The central portions of the region were tapped by the Missouri itself, the river described by the Indians as leading to the waters of the Columbia. And through the northern sections of the territory west of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s ran the Milk River, the channel "through which, those small streams, on the E side of the Rocky mountains laid down by <span class="tei_name">Mr. Fidler</span>, pass to the Missouri."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> adds, "This was a crucial rearrangement of the alignment of the Missouri and its tributary streams . . . [a] refinement of earlier lore." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0132" id="lnlc.belyea.0132" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a> But the "rearrangement" was simply a variation on the watershed theme. Science conceived of rivers in terms of watersheds, each river gathering volume from a number of smaller streams and flowing down to another river or the sea. Map signs were established on the basis of generally held geographical concepts such as those in <span class="tei_name">John Playfair</span>'s popular <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth</span>, published in 1802. In describing rivers that "descend over the most rapid slope"—rivers that are "most subject to irregular or temporary increase and diminution"—<span class="tei_name">Playfair</span> reiterates the concept of a system that divides and subdivides in a proliferation of smaller and smaller streams. "When we trace up rivers and their branches toward their source, we come at last to rivulets, that run only in time of rain," he remarks, emphasizing the watershed or collection basin as the operating principle of this pattern. Even small rivulets, <span class="tei_name">Playfair</span> argues (following <span class="tei_name">James Hutton</span>'s geological theory), can carve deep valleys by the force of their sudden descent. <span class="tei_name">Playfair</span> states "this great fact" in italics: "<span class="italic">rivers have, in general, hollowed out their valleys.</span>" <a href="#nlc.belyea.0133" id="lnlc.belyea.0133" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> This pattern of rivers and valleys was implicit in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s instructions to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>:</p>
         <p>Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take <span class="italic">careful</span> observations of latitude and longitude, at all remarkable points on the river, &amp; especially at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands, &amp; other places ... The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri, &amp; of the water offering the best communication with the Pacific ocean, should also be fixed by observation. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0134" id="lnlc.belyea.0134" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> imposed this scientific sense of a watershed system on the Missouri and Columbia rivers they were sent to explore. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s maps reflect his application of the river pattern of scientific cartography. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also relied on this scientific model in his "Summary view of the Rivers and Creeks" written at Fort Mandan during the winter of 1804–05. The explorers' image of the upper Missouri is not, as <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> claims, remarkable for a shift in the kind of "data" it assembles or for failing to make "basic distinctions" between mountain streams and prairie rivers," so much as it is remarkable for the imposition of an unchanging river pattern inherited from European cartography onto rivers both observed and unexplored. All of the descriptions in the "Summary view" repeat the distinction between "main stream" and tributaries that is fundamental to the scientific river pattern. An example is the notice of the Cheyenne River, which the expedition had passed in October 1804,</p>
         <p>
The Northern branch of this river penetrates the Black hills, and passes through a high broken well timbered country to it's source, the Southern fork takes it's rise in the Black hills, on their E side, and passes through a broken country covered with timber , . . . then entering an open fertile and level country it continues it's rout to the Missouri. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0136" id="lnlc.belyea.0136" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>As <span class="tei_name">Playfair</span> does, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> traces a river from mouth to source and/or from source to mouth indiscriminately, but either way, the river is defined and named by its nature at the mouth. Toward the source, it proliferates into smaller streams; these small streams and any lower affluents are tributaries of the main river. Each of the tributaries "falls" or "discharges" or "disembogues" into this "main stream."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s descriptions of rivers yet unexplored follow the same scientific model. During the winter at Fort Mandan, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> questioned resident <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s and visiting <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>s to ascertain "the subsequent discription of [the Missouri], and it's subsidiary streams . . . their connection with each other, and their relative positions." Whatever the Native informants' responses, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> recorded their descriptions as further examples of the usual pattern. Thus the Yellowstone River, at its source a mountain stream, closely resembles the Cheyenne, a river of the plains:</p>
         <p>from it's source it takes it's course for many miles through broken ranges of the Rocky mountains . . . after leaving the Rocky mountains it descends into a country more level, tho' still broken, fertile and well timbered . . . the river [then] enters an open level and fertile country through which it continues it's rout to the Missouri. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0137" id="lnlc.belyea.0137" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
For his description of the Yellowstone, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> combined his own observation of rivers entering the Missouri below Fort Mandan with application of the "logical and theoretical construction" of a river system advocated by contemporary science, and reliance on Native reports of the "Mee'-ah'-zah, or <span class="italic">Yellowstone river</span>" upstream from the fort. Similarly, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s description of the Milk River below the Marias owes its detail to <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> reports, but its design to careful perusal of <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s map.
</p>
         <blockquote><p><p>... a river falls in on the N. side called by the Minetares <span class="italic">Ah-mah-tah</span>, <span class="italic">ru-shush-sher</span> or the river which scolds at all others. this river they state to be of considerable size, and from it's position and the direction which they give it, we believe it to be the channel through which, those small streams, on the E side of the Rocky Mountain, laid down by <span class="tei_name">Mr. Fidler</span>, pas to the Missouri ...  <a href="#nlc.belyea.0138" id="lnlc.belyea.0138" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
         </p></p></blockquote>
         <p>Trying, as <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> had done three years before, to picture what Native visitors to Fort Mandan told him in terms that he could understand, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> imagined several rivers marked on <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s map as affluents of the larger "River which scolds at all others," which emptied in turn into the Missouri. Native images of the river were disregarded and only certain details retained, to be inserted into the explorers' scientific conception of a region they had not yet visited.
</p>
         <p>Consulting <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s map at the Missouri/Marias junction, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tried to balance the Native information they had been given at Fort Mandan with a European source that drew on <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s reports. <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> explains the American explorers' repeatedly voiced doubt of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s surveying abilities by referring to the successive states of the map: the first three issues had noted the extent of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s survey in 1792–93, but this note, removed as of the fourth issue, "could leave a reader of the map with the impression that <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> had travelled as far south as Bear's Tooth, shown on later states as the source of the Missouri's south branch."  <a href="#nlc.belyea.0139" id="lnlc.belyea.0139" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> is too generous: the 1802 states still clearly show <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s route to the Rocky Mountains in 1792 and his return the following year. Nor was the pattern of the upper Missouri and its tributaries, marked by the dotted lines that conventionally signified conjecture, to be understood as anything more than a hypothetical connection of the mountain sources to the surveyed lower river. <span class="tei_name">King</span> had understood the hypothetical nature of this image; on his map, the dotted lines are reinforced by the indication "Conjectural," in very large letters. Quite simply, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> misread the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> map. What they found deceptive was the familiarity of <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s Missouri—the "main stream," the proliferating tributaries, the scientifically acceptable pattern of a river system. This pattern was so plausible that the captains ignored the indication of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s route, overlooked the dotted lines, and doubted the surveyor's "varacity."  <a href="#nlc.belyea.0140" id="lnlc.belyea.0140" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>Apparently <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not aware of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s own reliance on Native visitors. <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s information about the Missouri River was not first-hand; it was derived instead from Native geographical knowledge. There is some confusion among historians over the source and nature of this knowledge. During the winter of 1802, <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> solicited five maps from "<span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span>" and "Fall Indian" (<span class="tei_name">Siksika</span> and <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span>) visitors to his trading post on the South Saskatchewan River. <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s copies of these Native maps survive. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0141" id="lnlc.belyea.0141" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>Every commentator except <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> has leapt to the conclusion that <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s image of the Missouri is based on the Native maps <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> had collected a few months before. <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> notes that as early as the fourth state, dated 1796 but probably issued in 1799, "new information on the geography south of 50° must have come from the Indians, through <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>, since there is no record of any explorations to these regions." Only the second issue dated 1802 (the sixth state) could have incorporated details from the five Native maps that <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> solicited. <span class="tei_name">Heckrotte</span> remarks that the sixth state "corrects and adds to the information which served as the basis for the Rocky Mountain region south of 50° on the two previous issues." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0142" id="lnlc.belyea.0142" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>In fact, transmission of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s own surveys and Native geographical knowledge to <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> extended over a period of several years. The Native maps drawn for <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> in 1801 and 1802 by <span class="tei_name">Ackomokki</span>, <span class="tei_name">Kioocus</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ackoweeak</span> (three "<span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> chiefs") and an unnamed "<span class="tei_name">Fall Indian</span>" were the last stage of this transmission. <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> copied them into his own journals, and also redrew one of them, <span class="tei_name">Ackomokki</span>'s 1801 map, as a separate sheet. The stages of drawing another map of his route to the Rockies ten years earlier are noted in <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s journal entries for March 1802. In July of that year, he sent both maps with a covering letter to the Hudson's Bay Company's board of directors:</p>
         <p>The enclosed is a Map of my Journey from Buckingham House to the Rocky Mountain in the Years 1792 a 3; in Six sheets. There is also an extra Sheet and half annexed to the above, shewing the Rivers and other remarkable places to the Mis sis sury river, which is taken solely from Indian information. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0143" id="lnlc.belyea.0143" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s "Maps &amp; Papers" arrived in London in late October 1802. <span class="tei_name">Alexander Lean</span>, the HBC Governor, forwarded them to <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>, writing of the transfer to <span class="tei_name">Sir Joseph Banks</span>, president of the Royal Society, and to <span class="tei_name">Alexander Dalrymple</span>, the Admiralty's hydrographer, both of whom were well known for their interest in exploration. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0144" id="lnlc.belyea.0144" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
            <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> seems to have used <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s two maps, received some time between late October and mid-December 1802, for the second issue dated 1802 (the sixth state) of his <span class="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries</span>.</p>
         <p>In sending his two maps to <span class="tei_name">Lean</span> in 1802, <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> was anxious to correct and supplement an earlier report on the sources of the Missouri that he claims to have sent to the HBC Committee seven years before.</p>
         <p>You will perceive some little difference betwixt this Map [drawn in 1802] and my former one; which I think I sent to your Honours in the Year 1795; but this [1802 map] is much the most compleat and exact of the two . . . I have put down the Rivers &amp; in the Indian Names, which is <span class="tei_name">black feet</span> &amp; have translated all that I was capable of into English in the Indian map. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0145" id="lnlc.belyea.0145" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>The first three states of <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s map, dated 1795 and 1796, show <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s journey with the <span class="tei_name">Peigan</span> band and do not extend the Rocky Mountains south of the farthest point of his survey. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0146" id="lnlc.belyea.0146" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a> The fourth state extends the Rockies south to the Bear's Tooth and shows eight streams flowing east from the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s 1802 letter seems to contrast the maps he sent to London at that time with the image of the Rockies shown on the first three states of <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s map. These source streams reappeared on the fifth state, the first issue dated 1802, but now they were connected by dotted lines with the Missouri River at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. The second issue dated 1802 omits the northernmost tributary, but the pattern of the watershed, together with the kind of Native information solicited and assimilated, remains the same. Thus the cartographic image of the Missouri that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> attributed to <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> was not based on the English trader's own survey, as the expedition leaders thought, nor, as historians have since claimed, was it based uniquely on the Native maps that <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> had solicited in 1801 and 1802. Moreover, the authorship of the conjectural watershed patterns is in doubt: possibly <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> drew the dotted lines, possibly <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> himself.</p>
         <p>By his own admission in his letter of July 1802, however, <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s copying of the Native maps had already begun the process of assimilation of Native "information" into the theoretical framework of aims, acceptable details, and conventional signs that defined European scientific cartography. The maps <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> solicited underwent three transformations: <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s transcription of the originals, <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s correlation, rationalization, and insertion of their images onto his own maps, and <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s incorporation of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s image into his series of updates. By these accommodations, Native knowledge of the upper Missouri, however and whenever acquired, was transformed into a scientifically plausible river system inscribed on an authoritative European map. At the same time, <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s own copying and re–copying of the five maps he solicited in 1801–02 (as well as many others during his fur–trade career) may well indicatehis tacit recognition that Native mapmakers were drawing more than he could interpret and incorporate into his own cartographic image. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0147" id="lnlc.belyea.0147" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a> The most he would acknowledge was that <span class="tei_name">Ackomokki</span>'s map, forwarded with his own in 1802,

         <p>The ephemeral nature of the originals, like the maps made for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> at Fort Mandan—"rough maps [drawn] in the dirt," and "rude drawings on animal skins or stick scratches in the dirt" according to <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> and <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span>
             <a href="#nlc.belyea.0149" id="lnlc.belyea.0149" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a>—points not to their insufficiency but to the way these maps were preserved and communicated. They were given graphic realization only in the context of specific situations, drawn from memory, accompanied by speech and gesture. Neither <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> nor <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made more than a cursory note that such conversations had taken place; their copies of Native maps are uncommented visual transcripts of an exchange that must have been much richer.</p>
         <p>Of <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s copies of the maps drawn for him in 1801 and 1802, <span class="tei_name">Ackomokki</span>'s first map (forwarded to London), the undated "Fall Indian" map, and a plan of journeys drawn by <span class="tei_name">Kioocus</span> in 1802 share largely unmodified conventions of Native cartography. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0150" id="lnlc.belyea.0150" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a> River routes are drawn as straight or gently curved (not wavy) lines that connect with the central line of the Missouri. The trellis pattern on these Native maps is unlike the scientific model described by <span class="tei_name">Playfair</span> and visualized by European cartographers. All of the river lines are given equal importance; all connect with the bar of the Rockies without the diminishing proliferation that is characteristic of rivers on the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> and <span class="tei_name">King</span> maps. This is because the lines on the Native maps depict not only water channels but the avenues or obstacles these rivers become for travelers moving east-west or north-south respectively. The even, firm lines indicate all the rivers as access roads into the mountains or fords along the front ranges; none of the rivers is privileged over the others. The central line of the Missouri River may indicate its importance as the subject of the maps in so far as they are responses to <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s request for knowledge about the Missouri. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0151" id="lnlc.belyea.0151" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Scientific cartography intrudes even on <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s copies.

         <p>Like <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> requested and collected maps from Native leaders he consulted. And like <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s copies of Native maps are hybrids that initiate the process of reformulation and assimilation in which <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s published images also played shifting, repeatedly modified parts. An early example survives from the captains' outward journey, drawn by the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> in January 1805. The Native trellis pattern persists on <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s copy, but the explorer has transcribed each of these rivers as a regularly undulating line, a compromise between Native design and European convention that is repeated many times on his 1810 map. It is interesting to note, on the maps he requested west of the divide, the importance assumed by the <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Fork river ("<span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s River"), which was transferred to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s composite maps drawn in late 1806 and in 1810.

         <h4>Preconceptions and Ways of Seeing</h4>
         <p>But so insistent an intrusion as the arc of "Clark's River" remains exceptional in <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s cartography. Similarly, there were moments such as the pause at the Missouri/Marias junction when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were driven to suspect the insufficiency of their own understanding, but such moments did not last. "Actual observations" were used to fill in blanks, not to revise conventional images. It is difficult to appreciate just how wide a gap there must have been between the Native people's way of seeing water- and landforms, and the explorers' insistence on their own standard geographical patterns. Like <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, like <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>, like <span class="tei_name">Allen</span> and <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span>, we tend to assume that our perception of geographic patterns is a direct understanding of natural phenomena—that we are accurately seeing what is there. A hint of this bias comes from explorers' tendency to rename geographical features, and historians' acceptance of these names as the "real" ones. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> identified the "River which scolds at all others" with the river he had named for its "peculiar whiteness"; according to <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>, this was "the Milk River of reality." <a href="#nlc.belyea.0154" id="lnlc.belyea.0154" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a> We need to remember that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came west laden with scientific baggage, the chief elements of which were not their instruments but their preconceptions: their "logical and theoretical constructions," to use <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>'s phrase again. We have inherited this way of seeing, as demonstrated by our scientifically correct topographical maps and geographical information systems. But the Native cartographers that <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> engaged were under no constraint to depict the upper Missouri as a watershed. Instead their maps show the Missouri as a web of equal streams, a series of fords, a multiplicity of access routes to the mountains. The logic of the captains' choice at the Marias occasioned the expedition's long detour past the Missouri's great falls to its three forks, across Lemhi Pass, and north along the Bitterroot trail. Yet shorter, easier routes could have been found by following well-worn Native trails to the buffalo. The captains' reliance on scientific geography actually slowed their progress, and for good reason: although they had great faith in details of Native "information" gained at Fort Mandan, they were less curious about the patterns of Native geographical knowledge.</p>
         <p>A more "remarkable act of the mind" than that of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> is left for us to accomplish: to realize that river shapes and "connection with other rivers" are not limited to the watershed pattern we unthinkingly accept. This is very hard to do, since our vocabulary of rivers (<span class="italic">source, branch, mainstream, affluent, tributary, watershed</span>) reflects the hegemonic model of empirical science. We do not have appropriate words to describe or explain what is traced on the maps <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> solicited. But we can at least acknowledge that Native maps were not simply "rude drawings," as <span class="tei_name">Moulton</span> calls them—sketchy, approximate, crude designs that European and American explorers felt obliged to revise, pulverize into "data" and insert into their own "correct" geography. <a href="#nlc.belyea.0155" id="lnlc.belyea.0155" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a> The captains' dilemma at the Missouri/Marias junction was the dilemma of all exploration, and especially of frontier cartography: the coexistence of two cultural verities—that of the Native inhabitants, and the explorers' own. In the end, one kind of knowledge could not be integrated, rationalized, reduced to the other, despite the partial inclusion of details learned from Native informants on scientific maps that the explorers carried with them. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> suspected <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s "varacity" when the periphery of <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s map became his own center of interest. The captains were intent on replacing both Native knowledge and "erroneous" constructions with their own "actual observations," according to the progression outlined by <span class="tei_name">Allen</span>. But as we have seen, their mapping simply continued the patchwork compilation that had produced the <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> 1802 update and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s own Fort Mandan map. On his return <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> continued the same process of combining his own surveys with reports from Native informants and traders, selected and rationalized to conform with scientifically acceptable ideas and patterns. His great map of the West, drawn in 1810, was engraved by <span class="tei_name">Samuel Lewis</span> and published in 1814 with the <span class="tei_name">Biddle</span>/<span class="tei_name">Allen</span> text. <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> was to extend the process by one more stage when he selectively copied information from the Samuel <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> map onto his next update of the <span class="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries</span>.</p>
         <p>With <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span>'s 1814 update, the process of scientific enquiry that had prompted the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition came full circle. As he had <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>'s maps, <span class="tei_name">Arrowsmith</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s work the imprimatur of scientific authority and made it available for yet further correction in the field. In their journals <span class="tei_name">Fidler</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expressed a qualified awareness of and confidence in Native knowledge; on their maps, whatever the Native visitors to Fort Mandan had said about the Missouri upstream, whatever they had drawn, pointed to, and named was transformed out of recognition or rejected in favor of a "correct" scientific view. At best we can reconstruct this cultural frontier as a tentative, fragmented, one-sided account of the explorers' attempt to assimilate this knowledge into their own image of the West. The other voice of the dialogue is missing, and that absence is our loss.</p>
