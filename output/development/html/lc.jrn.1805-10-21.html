                  <em class="hi">Monday 21st.</em>    We continued our voyage at an early hour, and had a fine morning. At 10, we came to the lodges of some of the natives, <a href="#n24102116" id="ln24102116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and halted with them about 2 hours. Here we got some bread, made of a small white root, <a href="#n24102117" id="ln24102117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> which grows in this part of the country. We saw among them some small robes made of the skins of grey squirrels, <a href="#n24102118" id="ln24102118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> some racoon skins, and 
acorns, <a href="#n24102119" id="ln24102119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> which are signs of a timbered country not far distant. Having proceeded on again, we passed several more lodges of Indians; and through two very rocky rapid parts of the river with great difficulty. We went 32 miles and encamped at some Indian lodges, where we procured wood from the natives to cook with.
