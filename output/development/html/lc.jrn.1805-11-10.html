                  <em class="hi">Sunday 10th.</em>    We had a rainy morning, but the wind was not so high as it had been yesterday; and we set out from <a class="regularization" title="Grays Point (Cape Swells)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Grays%20Point%20%28Cape%20Swells%29">Cape Swell</a>, coasted along 8 miles, passed some high cliffs of sandy rocks, and then came to a point; where we found the swells so high, the wind having risen, that we could not proceed; so we had to return back about a mile to get a safe harbour. Here we dined on some pounded salmon, that we had procured from the Indians; and unloaded our canoes. After we had been here about 2 hours, it became more calm, and we loaded the canoes again, but could not get round the point, the swells were still so high; we therefore put too at a branch of fresh water, under high cliffs of rocks and unloaded again. Here we scarcely had room to lie between the rocks and water; but we made shift to do it among some drift wood that had been beat up by the tide. It rained hard all night, and was very disagreeable. While on our way down today, we saw some porpoises, sea otter and a great many sea gulls. The water is become very salt.

Sunday Novemr. 10th    We had rain the greater part of last night &amp; a wet rainey morning, but the Waves did not run so high as they did Yesterday.    We loaded our Canoes &amp; set out.    We proceeded on, and passed high hills with pine trees growing on them, some high Clifts of rocks &amp; several fine Springs of fresh water.    We saw in the River a number of Porpoises, &amp; Sea Otters, Sea Gulls &amp; Ducks in the greatest abundance.    We continued on our way, it raining hard on us, 'till about noon; when it ceased.    The Waves then ran so high that we had to turn back and went up the River about 2 Miles, before we could find a harbour to unload the Canoes.    We at last found a convenient place, at which we unloaded our Canoes.    We halted at that place, where we staid till towards evening, when we loaded our Canoes again, and proceedd on up the River in hopes to find a safer harbour, than 
the one that we had left.    We went a small distance from the place we left, &amp; came to a large Spring run; lying on the South side, in a bend of the River, where we stopped &amp; Encamped.    we again unloaded the Canoes, &amp; had scarcely room to lay down, the hills making in so close to the River.    We went about 7 Miles this day, our course being nearly West.—
