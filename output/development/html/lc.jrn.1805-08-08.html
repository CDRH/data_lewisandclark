We had a heavy dew this morning.    as one canoe had been left we had now more hads to spear for the chase; game being scarce it requires more hunters to supply us.    we therefore dispatched four this morning.    we set out at sunrise and continued our rout up the river which we find much more gentle and deep than below the entrance of <a class="regularization" title="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Big%20Hole%20%28Sensable%2C%20Wisdom%29%20River">Wisdom river</a> it is from 35 to 45 yards wide very crooked many short bends constituteing lage and general bends; insomuch that altho' we travel briskly and a considerable distance yet it takes us only a few miles on our general course or rout.    there is but very little timber on this fork principally the under brush frequently mentioned. I observe a considerably quantity of the buffaloe clover in the bottoms. <a href="#n18080801" id="ln18080801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    the sunflower, flax, green swoard, thistle and several species of the rye grass some of which rise to the hight of 3 or 4 feet. <a href="#n18080802" id="ln18080802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    there is a grass <a href="#n18080803" id="ln18080803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> also with a soft smooth leaf that bears it's seeds very much like the timothy but it dose not grow very luxouriant or appear as if it would answer so well as the common timothy for meadows.
