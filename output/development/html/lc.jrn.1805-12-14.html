                  <em class="hi">Saturday 14th.</em>    The two hunters that had killed the elk, went back with two other men to take care of the meat. In the course of the day a good deal of rain fell; the weather here still continues warm, and there has been no freezing, except a little white frost. In the afternoon, the savages all went away. We completed the building of our huts, 7 in number, all but the covering, which I now find will not be so difficult as I expected; as we have found a kind of timber in plenty, which splits freely, and makes the finest puncheons I have ever seen. <a href="#n26121401" id="ln26121401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> They can be split 10 feet long and two broad, not more than an inch and an half thick.
