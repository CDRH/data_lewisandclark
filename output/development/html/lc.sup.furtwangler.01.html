        <p>In recent months, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>'s child has come out of the footnotes of history to an enduring fame around the world. His image — or the image of a baby representing him — now shines on a brightly minted dollar coin, and his story is sure to be publicized and retold often through the coming bicentennial celebrations of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition of 1803–1806. Here in <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>, a re-dedication took place on June 24, 2000, at his grave site near <span class="tei_name">Jordan Valley</span> in the southeast corner of the state. It was an occasion for clearing and improving the site as a tourist attraction and for highlighting <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>'s claim to an important person in the expedition. The grave site has long been a pilgrimage destination for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> devotees. It has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1971, after the site was developed and dedicated through the efforts of local people and <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span> members of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Trail Heritage Foundation.</p>
        <p>But what can we say about the person whose life ended there in 1866? The signboard at the site outlines a tantalizing history. The child was born on February 11, 1805, at the winter camp of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> (in what is now <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>). Just a few weeks later the party headed west and the child came along, survived risks and hardships over thousands of miles, and returned safely in 1806. Just days after <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> parted down river, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sent a letter back to the boy's father, <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>, making an offer to educate the child and treat him as his own. After an interval, the child (by now named <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</span> and nicknamed Pomp) was brought to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and educated at <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s expense. A further turn of fortune lay ahead. In 1822, a European prince, <span class="tei_name">Paul Wilhelm of Wurttemberg</span>, ascended the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> on an expedition of scientific curiosity. He met the youth, still in his teens, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Kansas River</span> and agreed to carry him along to <span class="tei_name">Europe</span> on his return. From 1824 to 1829, the young man lived at a palace in</p>
