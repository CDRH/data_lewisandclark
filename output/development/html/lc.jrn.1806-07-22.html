We set out very early this morning as usual and proceeded up the river.    for the first seven miles of our travel this morning the country was broken the land poor and intermixed with a greater quantity of gravel than usual; the ravines were steep and numerous and our horses feet have become extreemly soar in traveling over the gravel <a href="#n37072201" id="ln37072201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    we therefore traveled but slow. <a href="#n37072202" id="ln37072202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    we met with a doe Elk which we wounded but did not get her.    the river is confined closely between clifts of perpendicular rocks in most parts.    after the distance of seven miles the country became more level les gravly and some bottoms to the river but not a particle of timber nor underbush of any discription is to be seen.    we continued up the river on it's South side for 17 miles when we halted to glaize our horses and eat; there being no wood we were compelled to make our fire with the buffaloe dung which I found answered the purpose very well.    we cooked and eat all the meat we had except a small peice of buffaloe meat which was a little tainted.    after dinner we passed the river and took our course through a level and beautifull plain on the N. side. the country has now become level, the river bottoms wide and the adjoining plains but little elivated above them; the banks of the river are not usually more than from 3 to four feet yet it dose not appear ever to overflow them.    we found no timber untill we had traveled 12 miles further when we arrived at a clump of large cottonwood trees in a beautifull and extensive bottom of the river about 10 miles below the foot of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountains</a> where this river enters them; as I could see from hence very distinctly where the river entered the mountains and the bearing of this point being S of West I thought it unnecessary to proceed further and therefore encamped resolving to rest ourselves and horses a couple of days at this place and take the necessary observations. <a href="#n37072203" id="ln37072203" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    this plain on which we are is very high; the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountains</a> to the S.
