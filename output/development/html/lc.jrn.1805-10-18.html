The course is something to the east of south for about 12 miles and then winds round to almost a west course. We passed some islands and a number of the camps of the natives, which appear to be very shy and distant. We went 21 miles and halted close below an Indian camp; where they have thirty canoes; and a great quantity of dried fish.

Friday October 18th    A clear pleasant morning.    Our officers delayed till after 12 o' Clock A. M. to compleat &amp; prove the observation that they had taken Yesterday, and to make farther remarks on those Two Rivers which we
