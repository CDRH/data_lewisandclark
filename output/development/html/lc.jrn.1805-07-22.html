We set out early as usual. The river being divided into such a number of channels by both large and small Island that I found it impossible to lay it down correctly following one channel only in a canoe and therefore walked on shore took the general courses of the river and from the rising grounds took a view of the Islands and it's different channels which I laid don in conformity thereto on my chart.    there being but little timber to obstruct my view I could see it's various meanders very satisfactorily. I passed though a large island which I found a beautifull level and fertile plain about 10 feet above the surface of the water and never overflown.    on this Island I [<em class="hi">NB: We</em>] met with great quantities of a smal onion <a href="#n17072201" id="ln17072201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> about the size of a musquit ball and some even larger; they were white crisp and well flavored    I geathered about half a bushel of them before the canoes arrived. I halted the party for breakfast and the men also geathered considerable quantities of those onions.    it's seed had just arrived to maturity and I gathered a good quantity of it. This appears to be a valuable plant inasmuch as it produces a large quantity to the squar foot and bears with ease the rigor of this climate, and withall I think it as pleasantly flavored as any species of that root I ever tasted. I called this beatifull and fertile island after this plant <a class="regularization" title="Onion Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Onion%20Island">Onion Island</a>.    here I passed over to the stard. shore where the country was higher and ascended the river to the entrance of a large creek which discharges itself into the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> on the Stard. side.    it is composed of three pretty considerable creeks which unite in a beautifull and extensive vally a few miles before it discharges itself into the river. <a href="#n17072202" id="ln17072202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    while wateing for the canoes to arrive I killed an otter which sunk to the bottom on being shot, a circumstance unusual with that anamal.    the water was about 8 feet deep yet so clear that I could see it at the bottom; I swam in and obtained it by diving. I halted the party here for dinner; the canoes had taken different channels through these islands and it was sometime before they all came up. I placed my thermometer in a good shade as was my custom about 4 P. M. and after dinner set out without it and had proceeded near a mile before I recollected it    I sent <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Sergt.

Monday July 22nd    A clear pleasant morning, we set out Early, and proceeded on, and passed a very large Island, which was covered with grass &amp; had a few trees growing on it, We found growing along the shores of the River, a great quantity of Currants; We took into a narrow Channell, of the River which run behind an Island, which was about 5 Miles through, Our party began to think before we had passed through this Channel, that we had taken the wrong River, For The whole of these 5 Miles, 〈had〉 we saw a 
number of Islands lying a small distance from each other, 2 of which was very large.    They lay very level and were all Priaries.—    We were all well pleased when we passed the last of these Islands, and found that we entered into the 
River, which appear'd the same as when we took this Channel, One of our party killed a Deer on the North side of the River, which we took on board our Canoe,—    <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> had forgot his Thermometer which he had hung in a Shade, It stood this day, at 80 degrees above 0.    I was sent back for it, and got it, I then proceeded on after our party, I passed several Islands, which were cover'd with Cotton wood &amp; Cedar timber, the River divided in a number of Channels,—    I took a near cut to the River, and at Night got to it, but was ahead of our party, I went down the River to where they were encamped.—    <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clark</a>, and a party of our Men, had during my absence arrived, and were all well,—    They mentioned that they had seen a great deal of Indian sign along the River,—    and a fire which from its burning, appeared to have been lately left, our party expect that fire was made by a party of the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Snake</a> Indians, who they suppose is near this place, and that they are alarmed at our party firing at Game &amp;ca.    We came 17½ Miles this day 〈and〉 through a rapid Current.—    We passed this day through a very pleasant Country abounding with Currants &amp;ca.—    which grows along the Shores on both sides—     <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Our Interpreters Wife</a> (<a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">the Indian woman</a>) informed us, that she knows this Country, along the Shores of the River, up to her nation, (which are the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Snake</a> Indians) who she says lives at the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">3 forks</a> of this River.—    We are now 166 Miles distant from the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">great falls of the Mesouri River</a>.—    These Islands we passed this day we named Whitehouses Islands.
