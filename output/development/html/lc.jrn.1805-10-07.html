               <p>
Monday October 7th    This morning we had clear pleasant weather, all our party that were able were employed in getting the other three new Canoes into the River, which they effected.    they got every thing in readiness on board of them and got them loaded.    About 3 oClock P. M. we set out on our way to descend the River, &amp; the 2 Indians of the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Snake</a> Nation, that came to Pilot us across the Mountains, agreed to continue with us.    We also had a chief &amp; one Indian from the last Town we came through who also 
agreed to accompany us.—    These two last Indians, set off down the River by land to go some distance, &amp; intend to join our party again.    We then proceeded on our Voyage, and crossed a number of bad rapids, where our 
Canoes got fast, &amp; obliged us to get out in the Water (that was cold) and hawl them off.    we found the Water in some places deep, &amp; the current running gentle for some distance.    The Rapids were very frequent &amp; Shoal, the bottom of the River rockey, and the hills making close in to the River on both sides of it.    There is some Clifts of rocks, lying along the Shore &amp; a few scattering pine trees, growing on some of the hills 〈but they〉 which are mostly broken &amp; covered with grass.    We saw some few cotton wood Trees, growing on each side of the River along the Shore, We also found, that in some of the Rapids where we had plenty of water for our Canoes to pass, that 
the Waves ran so high that our Canoes took in a great deal of water, &amp; we struck several Rocks, in passing over them, but the Rapidity of the stream forced us over them.—</p>
               <p>
We came about 27 Miles this day, and encamped on the North side of the River.    The Canoe that our Officers went in, leaked so bad, that they were forced to unload it, &amp; put their baggage into another Canoe, for fear of getting their Mathematical Instruments &amp; baggage wet.    We passed this afternoon some old Indian Camps &amp; saw a Canoe lying on the Shore.    The Evening proved cloudy.    One of our party was taken ill, this evening of a Cholic occasioned by being so much in the water.
