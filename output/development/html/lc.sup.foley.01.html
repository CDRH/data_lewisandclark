            <p>In the summer of 1789 when <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, then a nineteen-year-old militiaman, first laid eyes on the settlement of <span class="tei_name">Vincennes in the Northwest Territory</span>, he encountered a frontier society far different from the one he knew and understood. A Virginian by birth, the young Kentuckian was unimpressed with what he saw. <span class="tei_name">Billy</span>, as the Clark family called him, wrote in his journal: "Post Vincennes is a old and starved place the howses bas[e] but clean . . . low and bilt after the French fasion. I was astonished at seeing so larg[e] and old a Town without any Settlement round." <a href="#nlc.foley.0101" id="lnlc.foley.0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Clearly unaware that the communal French Creoles favored village life and common fields over the scattered settlements and individual farmsteads so familiar to him, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had much to learn. In time he would become well acquainted with French ways and customs, but for the moment they seemed strange and different to the youthful Anglo-American.</p>
            <p>After he joined the regular army, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s duties periodically took him to <span class="tei_name">Fort Knox</span>, a U.S. military post at Vincennes. During his deployment there in the winter of 1793–1794, the congenial townspeople saw to it that the young American lieutenant was included on their guest lists for social occasions–no doubt in part because he was the younger brother of <span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span>, whom many of them had come to know during the course of his western campaigns during the American Revolutionary War. The Creoles surely reminded their young American friend of the support they had rendered in that conflict, and he in turn may have shared stories about his brother <span class="tei_name">John</span>'s brief service with the <span class="tei_name">Marquis de Lafayette</span>'s forces during the war's final Virginia campaign. For <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> the succession of balls and card games in Vincennes provided a welcome respite from the boredom and fatigue of army life. Never one to pass on a party, he was warming up to the French and their ways even as his fondness for the military life momentarily waned. <a href="#nlc.foley.0102" id="lnlc.foley.0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> resigned his commission in the U.S. Army in July 1796 in search of what he once referred to as "some more honourable imployment for my youthful days." <a href="#nlc.foley.0103" id="lnlc.foley.0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> He had confided to his brother <span class="tei_name">Edmund</span> that the possibilities for opening an extensive and successful trade on the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi River</span> seemed especially promising. <a href="#nlc.foley.0104" id="lnlc.foley.0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Not long after returning to civilian life, <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> found himself back in the French settlement on the <span class="tei_name">Wabash River</span> representing his older brother <span class="tei_name">George</span> in a lawsuit that threatened the family's <span class="tei_name">Indiana</span> landholdings. After conferring with local authorities, the younger <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> traveled on to <span class="tei_name">Kaskaskia</span> in pursuit of documents that he believed might buttress his brother's defense. While there he took time to reconnoiter the French settlements across the river in <span class="tei_name">Spanish Illinois</span>. In <span class="tei_name">Ste. Genevieve</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was a guest of the wealthy and influential <span class="tei_name">Francois Valle II</span>, a useful acquaintance for any young man of business with ambitions in that part of the world. <a href="#nlc.foley.0105" id="lnlc.foley.0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>From <span class="tei_name">Ste. Genevieve</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> traveled to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, where on September 10, 1797, he first glimpsed the city that he would call home during the final thirty years of his life. The Creole settlement with its well-built homes and commanding view of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> was already a major entrepôt of the western fur trade. </p>
            <p>Lieutenant Governor <span class="tei_name">Zenon Trudeau</span>, a <span class="tei_name">New Orleans-born</span> French Creole in Spanish service: <span class="tei_name">Auguste</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span>, prominent fur merchants and members of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>'s founding family; and their bilingual brother-in-law, trader <span class="tei_name">Charles Gratiot</span>, a special friend to Americans and to <span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span>, welcomed the young Kentuckian to Upper Louisiana's thriving capital with the same gracious hospitality that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had come to consider a mark of French character. <a href="#nlc.foley.0106" id="lnlc.foley.0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>After supping with the Spanish lieutenant governor, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> attended a ball at the residence of <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span>, where he saw "all the fine girls and buckish Gentleman" and once again experienced the French <em class="hi">joie de vivre</em> with the amiable <span class="tei_name">Gratiot</span> serving as his interpreter and host. One may surmise that the conversation that evening was animated, the company enjoyable, and the libations plentiful, for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not retire to the <span class="tei_name">Gratiot</span> home until the wee hours of the following morning. Such was <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>'s formal entrée into the world of Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s French Creoles. <a href="#nlc.foley.0107" id="lnlc.foley.0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Six years later <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had an opportunity to renew old acquaintances in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> when he and <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> arrived in the western country to complete preparations for their Pacific expedition. Lieutenant Governor <span class="tei_name">Charles Delassus</span>'s refusal to allow the American exploring party to enter Spanish territory without the approval of his superiors in <span class="tei_name">New Orleans</span> forced <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to abandon their plan for establishing a winter camp on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>. They chose instead a location on the eastern side of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> across from the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> at <span class="tei_name">Wood River</span>, or as the French called it, the <span class="tei_name">Riviere du Bois</span>. <a href="#nlc.foley.0108" id="lnlc.foley.0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Delassus</span> may not have been accommodating, but the same could not be said for most of Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s other francophone residents. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s little fleet sailed up the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> on its way to <span class="tei_name">Wood River</span>, proudly flying the American colors, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported that as it approached <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> "the admiration of the people were So great, that hundreds Came to the bank to view us." The captains ordered the boats to drop anchor along the riverfront so they could briefly pay their respects in the capital city. During a courtesy call at the lieutenant governor's residence, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> encountered several former acquaintances. Whatever reservations they may have harbored about the pending American takeover of <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>, the Creoles seemed eager to make a positive impression on the young officers. <a href="#nlc.foley.0109" id="lnlc.foley.0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In private conversations out of the governor's hearing, <span class="tei_name">Auguste Chouteau</span> and Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s surveyor general, <span class="tei_name">Antoine Soulard</span>, exhibited a surprising willingness to be helpful. <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> allowed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to peruse his copy of Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s 1800 census, and <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> loaned him a manuscript map depicting the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> as far as the mouth of the Osage. <a href="#nlc.foley.0110" id="lnlc.foley.0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Their tacit cooperation fostered the creation of a cordial relationship between <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s francophones. The pragmatic Creoles, apprehensive about their prospects under a new American regime, exhibited remarkable adaptability as they braced themselves for the necessary adjustments to the requirements of an alien culture, government, and language. As gentlemen renowned for their conviviality and as businessmen with an eye on the future, <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>'s French-speaking merchants and traders wasted no time in extending the hand of friendship to the incoming Americans.</p>
            <p>During their stay at <span class="tei_name">Camp River Dubois</span>, which extended from December 1803 to May 1804, both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> often traveled to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, where they passed many pleasant hours in the comfortable homes of the <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> brothers. The foursome got along famously, notwithstanding their need to rely on translators to facilitate their conversations. Neither <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> nor <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> spoke French, and the <span class="tei_name">Chouteaus</span> were not fluent in English. <span class="tei_name">Auguste</span>, the quieter, more calculating, and less outgoing of the <span class="tei_name">Chouteaus</span>, somewhat resembled <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> in his demeanor and deportment, whereas the more extroverted <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span> and the easygoing and affable <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> seem to have been kindred spirits.</p>
            <p>Though the linguistic and cultural divide that separated the French Creoles and the Americans was deep, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> brothers soon discovered that they also had much in common. As seasoned veterans of frontier life, they shared mutual interests in Native American peoples and natural history. None had attended an institution of higher learning, but they were well educated and knowledgeable about many things. Ambitious and eager to achieve economic success, they also enjoyed the benefits and advantages of social standing within their respective communities.</p>
            <p>The <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> gentility and gracious hospitality favorably impressed both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Besides providing a welcome diversion from camp life, the visits also gave them an opportunity to learn more about the immense trans-<span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> territory they were preparing to traverse. The Frenchmen used these get-togethers to acquaint <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with their personal views on matters ranging from appropriate forms of government—they preferred a military one—to Indian policy. They also took advantage of their ripening friendships to strike bargains for the sale of merchandise to outfit the upcoming expedition. The <span class="tei_name">Chouteaus</span>' renown as businessmen and their vast experience in dealing with the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> tribes made them excellent advisers. <a href="#nlc.foley.0111" id="lnlc.foley.0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The frequency of these contacts increased in mid-February when <span class="tei_name">Delassus</span> received orders to proceed with the region's transfer to U.S. authorities. At the lieutenant governor's invitation, Captains <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> joined Spanish officials for an inspection tour of the local military fortifications, which <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> judged to be in a wretched state. According to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the outgoing Spanish official received Captain <span class="tei_name">Amos Stoddard</span>, the incoming American commandant, with a great deal of formality and parade. <a href="#nlc.foley.0112" id="lnlc.foley.0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was likely present in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> to observe the ceremonies of transfer on March 9 and 10, 1804, during which <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> signed the official transfer document as a witness.</p>
            <p>When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> confided to <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> that <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>, the American president, was eager to meet some western tribal leaders, the enterprising Frenchman promptly volunteered to escort a delegation of <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> chieftains to the federal capital. Well aware of <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span>'s long experience with the <span class="tei_name">Osages</span> and his influence in their camps, the American captains did not hesitate to accept the offer. They knew that no other non-native could serve so well in persuading the headmen from the powerful tribe to visit <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> or to observe American authority. <a href="#nlc.foley.0113" id="lnlc.foley.0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Shortly before <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span>'s departure for <span class="tei_name">Washington. D.C.</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> drafted an effusive letter of introduction for the French merchant, detailing the hospitality and assistance he had extended to both of the American officers during their months of preparation for the Pacific expedition. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> used that letter to fashion similar ones he sent to his <span class="tei_name">Kentucky</span> relatives. He may have borrowed his partner's flowery phrases, but the sentiments expressing his warm personal regard for <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> and his wife, <span class="tei_name">Brigitte</span>, were genuine. <a href="#nlc.foley.0114" id="lnlc.foley.0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>A final flurry of preparations for both the eastward-bound <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> delegation and the westward-bound Corps of Discovery kept both <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> brothers in close contact with the American explorers. At the last minute, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> advised <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that the <span class="tei_name">Chouteaus</span> had procured seven <em class="hi">engagés</em> to accompany the expedition as far as the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> reciprocated such favors by recommending <span class="tei_name">Auguste Pierre Chouteau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charles Gratiot, Jr.</span>, <span class="tei_name">Augustus Bougainville Lorimier</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Louis Lorimier, Jr.</span>, all scions of prominent Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> Creole families, for appointment to the newly established U.S. Military Academy at <span class="tei_name">West Point</span>. <a href="#nlc.foley.0115" id="lnlc.foley.0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> tarried in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> long enough to see <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> chieftains off to <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. Once they were safely on their way, he was ready to join <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the other members of the Corps of Discovery in <span class="tei_name">St. Charles</span>, a rustic Creole village on the banks of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. On May 20, 1804, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> bade farewell to his <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> friends and set out on horseback accompanied by an escort that included some of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>'s most prominent Creoles, including <span class="tei_name">Auguste Chouteau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charles Gratiot</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sylvestre Labbadie</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Dr. Antoine Saugrain</span> among others. They braved a driving rain to reach <span class="tei_name">St. Charles</span> in time to attend a bon voyage celebration arranged by local dignitaries there. The following day the Corps of Discovery began its historic trek to the cheers of well-wishers who had come to see them off. As the French Creoles mingled freely with the Anglo-Americans on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> riverbank, the expedition's departure symbolized the beginning of a long and successful partnership uniting the old French inhabitants and the American newcomers in a common effort to develop the trans-<span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> frontier. <a href="#nlc.foley.0116" id="lnlc.foley.0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>It was hardly surprising that upon their return twenty-eight months later, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> picked up where they had left off. When they put ashore in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> on September 23, 1806, an impromptu crowd lining the riverbank shouted its approval. On their first day back, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded in his journal: "We accepted of the invitation of Mr. <span class="tei_name">Peter Chouteau</span> and took a room in his house[.] we payed a friendly visit to Mr <span class="tei_name">August Chotau</span> and Some of our old friends this evening," where no doubt they regaled the St. Louisans with tales of their experiences during their lengthy absence. <a href="#nlc.foley.0117" id="lnlc.foley.0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Two days later St. Louisans feted the expedition's leaders with a sumptuous dinner and ball at <span class="tei_name">William Christy's Tavern</span>, during which the happy revelers drank no fewer than eighteen toasts. <a href="#nlc.foley.0118" id="lnlc.foley.0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> For <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> the occasion was doubly enjoyable because, at the invitation of the U.S. government, he was preparing to join the American explorers on their trek eastward for his second trip to the national capital. Neither <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> nor <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew that <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> was about to become his new home, but both men clearly welcomed the opportunity to celebrate the completion of their journey with their Creole friends.</p>
            <p>Once the applause died away, <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span> appointed <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> to replace the controversial General <span class="tei_name">James Wilkinson</span> as governor of the <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> Territory, and he named <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as brigadier general of the territorial militia and as U.S. Indian agent for all trans-<span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> tribes except the <span class="tei_name">Osages</span>. <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span>, recently named as their agent, was to continue in that post. Residents of the territory hailed the decision to assign the well-liked explorers to the vacant governmental posts. For <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the association with <span class="tei_name"> Missouri</span> would be a long and rewarding one, but for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> it would be only a brief interlude that was about to end tragically.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, who had been reluctant to accept the governorship, sent <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ahead to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> to take up his duties and to assist the incoming territorial secretary, <span class="tei_name">Frederick Bates</span>, a Virginian with a pronounced anti-French bias. In striking contrast with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who genuinely liked and respected Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s older inhabitants, <span class="tei_name">Bates</span> confided in a letter to his brother <span class="tei_name">Richard</span>: "The very name of liberty deranges their [the Creoles'] intellects, and it appears absolutely impossible for them to form accurate conceptions of the rights which Justice creates on the one hand, and the obligations which it imposes on the other." <a href="#nlc.foley.0119" id="lnlc.foley.0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> in early May 1807, the French Creoles must have considered him a welcome antidote to the acerbic <span class="tei_name">Bates</span>. In his attempts to counter the growing British influence among Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>'s Indian tribes and to shore up the territory's inadequate defenses, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not hesitate to solicit advice from his francophone friends. But an affair of the heart soon called <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> back to <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>, where early the next year he married <span class="tei_name">Judith (Julia) Hancock</span>, in whose honor he named a scenic <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> stream the <span class="tei_name">Judith River</span>. When the newlyweds arrived in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> to set up housekeeping the following June, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had seen to it that all was in readiness for the couple. <a href="#nlc.foley.0120" id="lnlc.foley.0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter the governor dispatched his friend <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> to negotiate with the <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> Indians and to supervise the construction of a combined trading factory and military outpost, first called <span class="tei_name">Fort Clark</span>, but later known as <span class="tei_name">Fort Osage</span>. Those negotiations led to one of the few serious disagreements between <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Chouteaus</span>, and it momentarily threatened to dissolve their developing alliance. When the <span class="tei_name">Osages</span> came to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> to protest the terms of the treaty they had signed in his presence, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> blamed <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> for having instigated their defiance in order to solidify his personal trading interests with the tribe. <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> remained undecided about <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span>'s role in the proceedings, but he noted that the affair had produced "a want of cordiality and confidence" between <span class="tei_name">Chouteau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <a href="#nlc.foley.0121" id="lnlc.foley.0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Their misunderstanding was soon set aside, perhaps over a few drinks and a friendly game of whist. Relations between <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> were sufficiently improved later in the year to enable them to join together with <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Pierre Menard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Lewis</span> (<span class="tei_name">Meriwether</span>'s brother), <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span>'s son <span class="tei_name">Auguste Pierre</span>, and several others to establish a new business venture—the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company. In all likelihood <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was also a silent partner. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> brought to the enterprise sound judgment, a reputation for integrity, and the possible benefits he might be able to bestow in his official capacity—assets his partners deemed equally valuable to a large capital stake. As a sign of their trust and confidence in the methodical <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, they made him the company's agent in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and assigned him to take care of its books. Throughout his public career, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> worked to promote the fur trade, and that support further cemented his relationship with the St. Louis Creoles who continued to dominate the business. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s control over the issuance of U.S. trading licenses did not lessen the value of his friendship.</p>
            <p>Governor <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s decision to pay the new company $7,000 to escort the stranded <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chieftain <span class="tei_name">Shehekshote</span>, or <span class="tei_name">White Coyote</span>, back to his village on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> drew fire from his superiors in <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> and was one of several factors that plunged the already despondent official into a still deeper despair, leading him to take his own life in the fall of 1809. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s tragic death was a blow to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> who continued to live in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. <a href="#nlc.foley.0122" id="lnlc.foley.0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The management of Indian affairs was one of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s primary concerns during his <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> years. As historian <span class="tei_name">Jay Buckley</span> has demonstrated, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was arguably the federal government's most important representative in deliberations with Indians in western America. He personally negotiated thirty-seven Indian treaties, more by far than any other U.S. official, and he never hesitated to look to Creole leaders for advice when it came to matters of Indian diplomacy. It was no mere coincidence that <span class="tei_name">Auguste Chouteau</span> assisted with twenty-six of the Indian treaties that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> helped arrange. <a href="#nlc.foley.0123" id="lnlc.foley.0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Following <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s death, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s political fortunes in the frontier territory were momentarily in the ascendancy. In 1813, President <span class="tei_name">James Madison</span> appointed him governor of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Territory—an office he retained until <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> became a state. During his tenure as governor, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> presided over a frontier territory where personal feuds and animosities frequently exacerbated disagreements over public policy. In the rough-and-tumble arena of <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> territorial politics, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> generally sided with members of the<span class="tei_name"> St. Louis</span> junto, an elite group of leaders dominated by influential French fur merchants and land claimants with substantial holdings in unconfirmed Spanish land titles. <a href="#nlc.foley.0124" id="lnlc.foley.0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was not averse to using his gubernatorial office to assist old friends and allies as well as family members. In one celebrated incident, over the strenuous objections of backers of the struggling Bank of St. Louis, he exercised his political muscle to secure legislative approval for chartering the rival Bank of Missouri headed by <span class="tei_name">Auguste Chouteau</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> later became a shareholder and officer in the new institution. His open identification with the city's Creole establishment eventually proved costly in <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>'s rapidly changing political climate. Rightly or wrongly, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s loyalty to longtime friends and members of the territorial establishment, coupled with his belief that their support served the national interest, guided his political choices. Ultimately his close association with individuals representing the old order proved to be a serious political liability that contributed to his defeat in the contest to elect <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>'s first governor following statehood.</p>
            <p>During the gubernatorial campaign, the opposition portrayed <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as a stiff, reserved <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span> aristocrat who had been far too cozy with the Indians. <a href="#nlc.foley.0125" id="lnlc.foley.0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> voters embraced his opponent, <span class="tei_name">Alexander McNair</span>, by the droves, but <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s Creole friends remained steadfast in their support. In a letter published in the <em class="hi">St. Louis Enquirer</em> only in French, the author, who signed himself a Louisianan, reminded <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>'s francophones that during the War of 1812 when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s predecessor, Governor <span class="tei_name">Benjamin Howard</span>, had accused them of favoring the savages over the government, their longtime friend had rushed to their defense and unequivocally vouched for their loyalty. <a href="#nlc.foley.0126" id="lnlc.foley.0126" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Unfortunately for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the overwhelming support he enjoyed among the old French inhabitants was insufficient to counter the influence of the state's burgeoning Anglo-American majority, and <span class="tei_name">McNair</span> handily trounced him by a margin of nearly three-to-one.</p>
            <p>Though disappointed, the steadfast <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took his loss in stride and turned his attention to the practical need for securing employment, preferably in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. His friends in the national government obliged by continuing him in his position as U.S. Indian agent, and in 1822 they gave him the title of superintendent of Indian affairs at <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s power and political influence may have been waning, and many of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s rank-and-file <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> constituents may have long since consigned his exploits as an explorer to the dustbin of history, but he still retained a modicum of fame. Distinguished guests visiting the West routinely called on <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who delighted in showing them his museum filled with Indian artifacts and other curiosities. A notable example was the <span class="tei_name">Marquis de Lafayette</span>, who made it a point during his brief 1825 stopover in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> to see <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and visit his museum. <a href="#nlc.foley.0127" id="lnlc.foley.0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Their cordial meeting helped offset any embarrassment resulting from <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Governor <span class="tei_name">Frederick Bates</span>'s refusal to receive the visiting French dignitary, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> subsequently sent him a live grizzly bear that became something of a sensation following its delivery in Paris. <a href="#nlc.foley.0128" id="lnlc.foley.0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Prophetically, five years earlier in the heat of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s unsuccessful 1820 gubernatorial campaign, a staunch Creole partisan had reminded his fellow francophones that Monsieur <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had never forgotten <span class="tei_name">Lafayette</span>'s assistance during the Revolutionary War or the role that French forces had played at Yorktown. <a href="#nlc.foley.0129" id="lnlc.foley.0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>It was fitting that in his final years <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> shared honors as St. Louis's elder statesman with <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span>. A friendship and alliance born many years before persisted to the end. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s 1820 campaign statement addressed to the people of <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> perhaps best summarized his Creole connection: "I came to this country, then Upper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>, in the fall of 1803, before the change of government, in company with the expedition which was planned by <span class="tei_name">Mr. Jefferson</span> and led by the late governor, then Captain <span class="tei_name"> Lewis</span>, to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific ocean</span>. On the return of that expedition I made <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> the home of my choice and the country of my permanent residence. This long residence has given me a personal acquaintance, which time has ripened into friendship, with most of the old inhabitants and early settlers: and to them I refer [you] for answers to any enquiries which may concern my individual and private character." <a href="#nlc.foley.0130" id="lnlc.foley.0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> To <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s way of thinking, they knew him as well as anyone.</p>
