Thursday August 30th    This morning was so foggy that we could not see across the River, untill it was late, about 9 o'Clock A. M. the Indians were brought across the River in a pettyauger.    Our Captains held a council with them &amp; deliver'd a speech to them, (which was interpreted by a frenchmen) <a href="#n06083012" id="ln06083012" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>    our Captains made 5 of them chiefs, and gave them medals, On the Talk being finish'd, they gave them all presents of Goods &amp; they thankfully receiv'd them</p>
               <p>
They put all the presents that they got, together, and divided them among their whole party equally.—    The Indians after the goods were divided, was very merry; they play'd on the Jews harps &amp; danced for us for Beads that we gave them.—    they behaved well to us.—    The Indian Boys shot with their Bows for some small trifles we gave them.—    After they had finished dancing <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> took his Air Gun and shot her off, and by the Interpreter, told them that there was medicine in her, and that she could do very great execution, They all stood amazed at this curiosity; <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> discharged the Air Gun several times, and the Indians ran hastily to see 〈if to see〉 the holes that the Balls had made which was discharged from it.    at finding the Balls had entered the Tree, they shouted a loud at the sight and the Execution that was done surprized them exceedingly.—    The shooting with the Air Gun being over, the Indians were supplied with Provisions.    As soon as dark set in, and a drum was prepared among them, The Young Indian Men painted themselves in different ways.    some of them painted their faces all over with white paint, others painted half their faces, and round their foreheads &amp; breasts with white paint also, when they had finish'd painting they then commenced their dancing, in a curious manner before us; one party of them sung &amp; kept time with the drum, whilst the remainder of them danced, especially the Young men commencing their dancing by a loud Whoop which they gave.—</p>
               <p>
The Indians continued to dance round the fire some time, and then would stop &amp; whoop.    in a few minutes after some one of their Warriors would get up in the Centre, where all their Warriors stood with his Arms; and point towards where the different Indian nations lived, and make a speech, telling what feats he had done, how many he had killed, &amp; how many Horses he had stole from them &amp;ca    all of which among these Indians, make them great Men, and Warriors; and much esteem'd by their nation.    The dance being finish'd the Indians retir'd to their Camp.—
