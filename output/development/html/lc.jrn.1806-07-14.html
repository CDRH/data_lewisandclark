Had the carriage wheels dug up    found them in good order.    the iron frame of the boat had not suffered materially.    had the meat cut thiner and exposed to dry in the sun.    and some roots of cows of which I have yet a small stock pounded into meal for my journey. I find the fat buffaloe meat a great improvement to the mush of these roots.    the old cash being too damp to venture to deposit my trunks &amp;c in I sent them over to the Large island and had them put on a high scaffold among some thick brush and covered with skins. I take this precaution lest some indians may visit the men I leave here before the arrival of the main party and rob them.    the hunters killed a couple of wolves, the buffaloe have almost entirely disappeared.    saw the bee martin.    the wolves are in great numbers howling arround us and loling about in the plains in view at the distance of two or three hundred yards. I counted 27 about the carcase of a buffaloe which lies in the water at the upper point of the large island.    these are generally of the large kind. <a href="#n37071401" id="ln37071401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
