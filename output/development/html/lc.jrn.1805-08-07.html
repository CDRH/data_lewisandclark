The creek which falls in above us we called <a class="regularization" title="Indian (Turf) Creek (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Indian%20%28Turf%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29">turf creek</a> from the cercustance of it's bottoms being composed of excellent turf. <a href="#n18080701" id="ln18080701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    my air gun was out of order and her sights had been removed by some accedent I put her in order and regulated her.    she shot again as well as she ever did. The clouds last night prevented my taking any lunar observations    this day I took Equal Altitudes of the ☉ with Sextant.</p>
