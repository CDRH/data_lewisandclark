This morning early <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">Reubin Fields</a> in surching for his horse saw a large bear at no great distance from camp; several men went in pursuit of the bear, they followed his trail a considerable distance but could not come up with him. <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Labuish</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Shannon, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George">Shannon</a> set out with a view to establish a hunting camp and continuing several days, two others accompanyed them in order to bring in the three bear which <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Labuish</a> had killed. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Cruzatte</a> were sent up the river; <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Sheilds</a>
                  <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">R. Feilds</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Willard</a> hunted in the hills near the camp they returned in the evening with a few pheasants only and reported that there was much late appearance of bear, but beleived that they had gone off to a greater distance.    at 11 A. M. the men returned with the bear which <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Labuich</a> had killed. <a href="#n35051501" id="ln35051501" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> These bear gave me a stronger evidence of the various coloured bear of this country being one speceis only, than any I have heretofore had. The female was black with a considerable proportion of white hairs intermixed and a white spot on the breast, one of the young bear was jut black and the other of a light redish brown or bey colour.    the poil of these bear were infinitely longer finer and thicker than the black bear their tallons also longer and more blont as if woarn by diging roots.    the white and redish brown or bey coloured bear I saw together on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>; the bey and grizly have been seen and killed together here for these were the colours of those which <a class="regularization" title="Collins, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collins%2C%20John">Collins</a> killed yesterday.    in short it is not common to find two bear here of this speceis precisely of the same colour, and if we were to attempt to distinguish them by their collours and to denominate each colour a distinct speceis we should find at least twenty.    some bear nearly white have also been seen by our hunters at this place.    the most striking differences between this speceis of bear and the common block bear are that the former are larger, have longer tallons and tusks, prey more on other animals, do not lie so long nor so closely in winter quarters, and will not climb a tree tho' eversoheardly pressed.    the variagated bear I beleive to be the same here with those on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">missouri</a> but these are not as ferocious as those perhaps from the circumstance of their being compelled from the scarcity of game in this quarter to live more on roots and of course not so much in the habit of seizing and devouring living animals.    the bear here are far from being as passive as the common black bear they have attacked and faught our hunters already but not so fiercely as those of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>.    there are also some of the common black bear in this neighbourhood. <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazier</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">J. Fields</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Weiser, Peter" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Weiser%2C%20Peter">Wiser</a> complain of violent pains in their heads, and <a class="regularization" title="Howard, Thomas P." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Howard%2C%20Thomas%20P.">Howard</a> and <a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">York</a> are afflicted with the cholic.

M. a party of 14 natives on horseback passed our camp on a hunting excurtion; they were armed with bows and arrows and had decoys for the deer these are the skins of the heads and upper portions of the necks of the deer extended in their natural shape by means of a fraim of little sticks placed within.    the hunter when he sees a deer conceals himself and with his hand gives to the decoy the action of a deer at feed; and thus induces the deer within arrowshot; in this mode the indians hunt on foot in the woodlands where they cannot pursue the deer with horses which is their favorite method when the ground will permit.—    we had all of our horses driven together today near our camp, which we have directed shall be done each day in order to familiarize them to each other. several of the horses which were gelded yesterday are much swolen particularly those cut by <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a>, <a href="#n35051502" id="ln35051502" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the others bled most but appear much better today than the others.</p>
               <p>
we had our baggage better secured under a good shelter formed of grass; we also strengthened our little fortification with pine poles and brush, and the party formed themselves very comfortable tents with willow poles and grass in the form of the orning of a waggon, these were made perfectly secure as well from the heat of the sun as from rain.    we had a bower constructed for ourselves under which we set by day and sleep under the part of an old sail now our only tent as the leather lodge <a href="#n35051503" id="ln35051503" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> has become rotten and unfit for use.    about noon the sun shines with intense heat in the bottoms of the river.    the air on the tom of the river hills or high plain forms a distinct climate, the air is much colder, and vegitation is not as forward by at least 15 or perhaps 20 days.    the rains which fall in the river bottoms are snows on the plain.    at the distance of fifteen miles from the river and on the Eastern border of this plain the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> commence and present us with winter it it's utmost extreem.    the snow is yet many feet deep even near the base of these mountains; here we have summer spring and winter within the short space of 15 or 20 miles.—    <a class="regularization" title="Hohots Ilppilp" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp">Hohâstillpilp</a> and the three old men being unable to pass the river as the canoe had been taken away, returned to our camp late in the evening and remained with us all night.—
