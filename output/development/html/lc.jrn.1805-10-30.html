Indian Village.—</p>
               <p>
This Village contained about 10 well looking Cabbins, (which were covered with bark) sunk in the ground, as those we had seen at the falls, which I have already described &amp; were much more comfortable &amp; larger sized.    The Indians belonging to this Village made signs to us as we passed along by their village, that they thought &amp; supposed that we had rained down from the Clouds, and seemed very much surprized at seeing us, they not beleiving that we could possibly descended the River at that season of the Year.    A number of our party went to this Indian Village, &amp; the Indians treated them in a very friendly manner, &amp; gave them the best they had to eat.    On each side of these falls, lays very high mountains, and about 2 Miles above them, we passed the mouth of a River which lay on the South side of this River, 
which was about 30 Yards wide &amp; by us called the <a class="regularization" title="Hood (Labiche's) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hood%20%28Labiche%27s%29%20River">River La Bache</a>. <a href="#n24103024" id="ln24103024" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>    We came about 15 Miles this day, &amp; encamped between the Indian Village &amp; the falls.    The Rain continued the greater part of this night.—
