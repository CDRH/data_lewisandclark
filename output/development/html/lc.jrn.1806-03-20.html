                  <em class="hi">Thursday 20th.</em>    The whole of this day was wet and disagreeable. We intended to have set out today on our return, but the weather was too bad. I made a calculation of the number of elk and deer killed by the party from the 1st of Dec. 1805 to the 20th March 1806, which gave 131 elk, and 20 deer. There were a few smaller quadrupeds killed, such as otter and beaver, and one raccoon. The meat of some of the elk was not brought to the fort.
