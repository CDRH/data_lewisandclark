our march to 2 o'clock when we halted at a spring and dined on portable soup, and a handful of parched corn. We then proceeded on our journey over the mountain to a high point, where, it being dark, we were obliged to encamp. There was here no water; but a bank of snow answered as a substitute; and we supped upon soup.

several of our horses fell backward, and rolled down among the Rocks between 20 &amp; 30 feet, but none of them were killed in the fall, We went on, and got on the Ridge of the Mountain.    We followed on the ridge of the Mountain &amp; went over several high knobs on it, where the Wind had blown down the most of the timber on them.    We found a small spring of water, before we came to the highest part of the Mountain; Where we halted &amp; drank some portable soup, We proceeded on, still on the top of the Mountain which was covered with Spruce Trees, &amp; some small Spots of Snow on it, &amp; high clifts of rocks.    This mountain is about ten Miles, from the foot of it, to the top,—    &amp; the most part of the way very steep.—</p>
