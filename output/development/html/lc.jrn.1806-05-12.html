The Indians held a council among themselves this morning with rispect to the subjects on which we had spoken to them yesterday.    the result as we learnt was favourable.    they placed confidence in the information they had received and resolved to pusue our advise.    after this council was over the principal Cheif or the <span class="italic">

I was told by one of our men who was present, that there was not a dissenting voice on this great national question, but all swallowed their objections if any they had, very cheerfully with their mush.    during the time of this loud and animated harangue of the Cheif the women cryed wrung their hands, toar their hair and appeared to be in the utmost distress. <a href="#n34051202" id="ln34051202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    after this cerimony was over the Cheifs and considerate men came in a body to where we were seated at a little distance from our tent, and two young men at the instance of the nation, presented us each with a fine horse. we caused the cheifs to be seated and gave them each a flag a pound of powder and fifty balls.    we also gave powder and ball to the two young men who had presented the horses. <a class="regularization" title="Cut Nose" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cut%20Nose">Neeshneeparkkeeook</a> gave <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> a good horse.

The air that fanned the village which we left at noon, was mild and cheering: the grass was verdant, and the wild fruits ripe around it.
