Set out this morning at the usual hour; the wind was moderate; I walked on shore with one man. <a href="#n12042901" id="ln12042901" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    about 8 A. M. we fell in with two brown or 〈yellow〉 [<em class="hi">X: White</em>] bear; both of which we wounded; one of them made his escape, the other after my firing on him pursued me seventy or eighty yards, but fortunately had been so badly wounded that he was unable to pursue so closely as to prevent my charging my gun; we again repeated our fir and killed him. <a href="#n12042902" id="ln12042902" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    it was a male not fully grown, we estimated his weight at 300 lbs, not having the means of ascertaining it precisely. The legs of this bear are somewhat longer than those of the black, as are it's tallons and tusks incomparably larger and longer.    the testicles, which in the black bear are placed pretty well back between the thyes and contained in one pouch like those of the dog and most quadrupeds, are in the yellow or brown bear placed much further forward, and are suspended in seperate pouches from two to four inches asunder; it's colour is yellowish brown, the eyes small, black, and piercing; the front of the fore legs near the feet is usually black; the fur is finer thicker and deeper than that of the black bear.    these are all the particulars in which this anamal appeared to me to differ from the black bear; it is a much more furious and formidable anamal, and will frequently pursue the hunter when wounded.    it is asstonishing to see the wounds they will bear before they can be put to death.    the Indians may well fear this anamal equiped as they generally are with their bows and arrows or indifferent fuzees, but in the hands of skillfull riflemen they are by no means as formidable or dangerous as they have been represented.    game is still very abundant we can scarcely cast our eyes in any direction without percieving deer Elk Buffaloe or Antelopes.    The quantity of wolves appear to increase in the same proportion; they generally hunt in parties of six eight or ten; they kill a great number of the Antelopes at this season; the Antelopes are yet meagre and the females are big with young; the wolves take them most generally in attempting to swim the river; in this manner my dog caught one drowned it and brought it on shore; they are but clumsey swimers, tho' on land when in good order, they are extreemly fleet and dureable.    we have frequently seen the wolves in pursuit of the Antelope in the plains; they appear to decoy a single one from a flock, and then pursue it, alturnately relieving each other untill they take it.    on joining <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> he informed me that he had seen a female and faun of the big-horned anamal; that they ran for some distance with great aparent ease along the side of the river bluff where it was almost perpendicular; two of the party fired on them while in motion without effect.    we took the flesh of the bear on board and proceeded. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> walked on shore this evening, killed a deer, and saw several of the bighorned anamals.    there is more appearance of coal today than we have yet seen, the stratas are 6 feet thick in some instances; the earth has been birnt in many places, and always appears in stratas on the same level with the stratas of coal. <a href="#n12042903" id="ln12042903" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    we came too this evening in the mouth of a little river, which falls in on the Stard. side.    This stream is about 50 yards wide from bank to bank; the water occupyes about 15 yards.    the banks are of earth only, abrupt, tho' not high—    the bed, is of mud principally. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a>, who was up this streeam about three miles, informed me that it continued about the same width, that it's current was gentle and it appeared navigable for perogus    it meanders through an extensive, fertile, and beautifull vally as far as could bee seen about N. 30° W.    there was but one solitary tree to be seen on the banks of this river after it left the bottom of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>.    the water of this river is clear, with a brownish yelow tint.    here the highlands receede from the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, leaving the vally formed by the river from seven to eight miles wide, and reather lower then usual.—    This stream my friend <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

Set out this morning at the usial hour.    the wind is moderate &amp; from the N E    had not proceeded far eer we Saw a female &amp; her faun of the Bighorn animal on the top of a Bluff lying, the noise we made allarmed them and they came down on the Side of the bluff which had but little Slope being nearly purpindicular, I directed two men to kill those anamals, one went on the top and the other man near the water    they had two Shots at the doe while in motion without effect, Those animals run &amp; Skiped about with great ease on this declivity &amp; appeared to prefur it to the leavel bottom or plain. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt Lewis</a> &amp; one man walkd on Shore and he killed a yellow Bear &amp; the man with him wounded one other, after getting the flesh of the bear on bord which was not far from the palce we brackfast, we proceeded on    Saw 4 gangus of buffalow and great numbers of Antelopes in every direction    also Saw Elk and Several wolves, I walked on Shore in the evening &amp; killed a Deer which was So meager as to be unfit for use    The hills Contain more Coal, and has a greater appearance of being burnt that below, the burnt parts appear on a parrilel with the Stratiums of Coal, we Came too in the mouth of a Little river on the S.

Monday April 29th    We set out Early as usual this morning, and proceeded on; and passed in the forenoon, some very high bluffs, being much higher, than any that we had seen, since we entered the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri River</a>.    On the Top of one of the highest of those Bluffs, we saw the Animal called the Ibex, or mountain Sheep, they were in a large Flock.—</p>

This animal is about the size of a large Buck deer,— the Colour Grey, and has hair coarse &amp; like that of a Goat, it ears small and its body lengthy, the horns like that of a Ram, (sheep) but four times as large.    They are very nimble, and generally are to be found on high Mountains and Bluffs, and are very Shy, and difficult to be come at.—    The Indian women that was with us, inform'd us that those animals were very common to be found On the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky mountains</a>.—    <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a>, and one of the hunters, went out a hunting for a short time, and killed a Bear which they brought to the Pettyaugers    This Bear was of a Yellow brownish colour, and had prodigious large Claws, and 〈are〉 is what is called the White Bear by the Natives; We continued on our Voyage, &amp; in the Evening, we encamp'd on the bank of a River, which emtied itself into the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri</a> on the North side, which is 70 Yards wide &amp; by our Officers called <a class="regularization" title="Big Muddy Creek (Martha's River, Yellow River)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Big%20Muddy%20Creek%20%28Martha%27s%20River%2C%20Yellow%20River%29">Martha's River</a>, having come 25 Miles
