The loss of one of our perogues rendered it necessary to distribute her crew and cargo among the 2 remaining perogues and 2 canoes, which being done we loaded and set out 8 A. M.    we passed the village immediately above the rapids <a href="#n31041301" id="ln31041301" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> where only one house at present remains entire, the other 8 having been taken down and removed to the oposite side of the river as before mentioned.    we found the additional laiding which we had been compelled to put on board rendered our vessels extreemly inconvenient to mannage and in short reather unsafe in the event of high winds; I therefore left <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

I found the village consisting of 11 houses crouded with inhabitants; it appeared to me that they could have mustered about 60 fighting men then present.    they appeared very friendly disposed, and I soon obtained two small canoes from them for which I gave two robes and four elkskins. I also purchased four paddles and three dogs from them with deerskins.    the dog now constitutes a considerable part of our subsistence and with most of the party has become a favorite food; certain I am that it is a healthy strong diet, and from habit it has become by no means disagreeable to me, I prefer it to lean venison or Elk, and is very far superior to the horse in any state.    after remaining about 2 hours at this Village I departed and continued my rout with the four canoes along the S. side of the river the wind being too high to pass over to the entrance of <a class="regularization" title="Wind (Cruzatte's) River (Wash.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Wind%20%28Cruzatte%27s%29%20River%20%28Wash.%29">Cruzatts river</a>
