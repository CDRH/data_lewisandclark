The morning was fair and pleant.    the Islands seem crouded with blackbirds; the young brude is now completely feathered and flying in common with the others.    we corked the canoes and put them in the water and also launched the boat, she lay like a perfect cork on the water.    five men would carry her with the greatest ease. I now directed seats to be fixed in her and oars to be fitted.    the men loaded the canoes in readiness to depart.    just at this moment a violent wind commenced and blew so hard that we were obliged to unload the canoes again; a part of the baggage in several of them got wet before it could be taken out.    the wind continued violent untill late in the evening, by which time we discovered that a greater part of the composition had seperated from the skins and left the seams of the boat exposed to the water and she leaked in such manner that she would not answer. I need not add that this circumstance mortifyed me not a little; and to prevent her leaking without pich was impossible with us, and to obtain this article was equally impossible, therefore the evil was irraparable    I now found that the section formed of the buffaloe hides on which some hair had been left, answered much the best purpose; this leaked but little and the parts which were well covered with hair about ⅛th of an inch in length retained the composition perfectly and remained sound and dry.    from these circumstances I am preswaided, that had I formed her with buffaloe skins singed not quite as close as I had done those I employed, that she would have answered even with this composition.    but to make any further experiments in our present situation seemed to me madness; the buffaloe had principally dserted us, and the season was now advancing fast. I therefore relinquished all further hope of my favorite boat and ordered her to be sunk in the water, that the skins might become soft in order the better to take her in peices tomorrow and deposite the iron fraim at this place as it could probably be of no further service to us.    had I only singed my Elk skins in stead of shaving them I beleive the composition would have remained and the boat have answered; at least untill we could have reached the pine country which must be in advance of us from the pine which is brought down by the water and which is probably at no great distance where we might have supplyed ourselves with the necessary pich or gum.    but it was now too late to introduce a remidy and I bid a dieu to my boat, and her expected services.— <a href="#n16070901" id="ln16070901" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    The next difficulty which presented itself was how we should convey the stores and baggage which we had purposed carrying in the boat.    both <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
