                  <em class="hi">Sunday 20th.</em>    A fine clear frosty morning. We set out early; passed along a handsome part of the river; saw some pelicans and gulls. And as the shores are lined with dead salmon, there are abundance of crows and ravens. Vast quantities of these fish die at this time of the year. At noon we came to an Indian camp on the point of a large island, where we stopped and got some fish and other provisions. We here saw some articles which shewed that white people had been here or not far distant during the summer. They have a hempen seine and some ash paddles which they did not make themselves. 
At 1 o'clock we proceeded on again, went 42 miles, and encamped without any of the natives being along, which is unusual on this river. We could not get a single stick of wood to cook with; and had only a few small green willows.

Sunday October 20th    A clear frosty morning, We set out early on our Voyage, &amp; passed a handsome piece of the River, where the Country lay low &amp; smooth plains lying on both sides of the River, We saw some Pelicans &amp; a number of Crows &amp; Ravens, which we supposed to be occasiond from the very great quantity of dead Salmon, which the River Shores were lined with.—    About 12 o'Clock A. M. we came to where, there was a very large Camp of Indians, laying on the point of an Island.    We halted to dine at that place.    We purchased from those Indians, several small articles &amp; saw among them some articles which 〈they〉 must have been originally purchased from white people.    They were Copper kettles, red Cloth, Ash paddles neatly made; knives &amp;ca.    We proceeded on, and passed a great number of Indian Camps, which were inhabited in all of which the Natives had abundance of Salmon hung up on scaffolds to dry.    We also passed over a number of Rapids but without any accident, happening to us.—</p>
               <p>
The appearance of the Country is the same as Yesterday.    Our hunters killed 9 Ducks, &amp; a goose this day in the River.    In the evening we encamped on the North side of the River, where we found no other article to make fire 
with, but small sticks &amp; green Willows.    We saw this day among the Natives, some Acorns, which they roasted &amp; Eat, and some red Cloth, which appeared not to be long Imported from Europe.—
