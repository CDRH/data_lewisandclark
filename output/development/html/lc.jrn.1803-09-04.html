Morning foggy, obliged to wait.

            <div class="footnote" id="n02090401">1. The French word <em class="hi">pirogue</em> was used in the fur trade for a large dugout canoe or open boat. McDermott (GMVF), 118–19; Russell (FTT), 47. It is not clear if this vessel was actually a pirogue, as <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> seems to have used the terms <em class="hi">pirogue</em> and <em class="hi">canoe</em> interchangeably. If it actually was a pirogue, it may have been either the red or the white pirogue so-called that figured prominently during the expedition. In this entry <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> also mentions purchasing a canoe at <a class="regularization" title="Georgetown, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Georgetown%2C%20Pa.">Georgetown</a> and then speaks of two canoes (as he does the next day, September 5), but this is probably two vessels in addition to the keelboat and not two canoes in addition to the keelboat and pirogue. Again the confusion of terminology. One more vessel was purchased at <a class="regularization" title="Wheeling, W. Va." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Wheeling%2C%20W.%20Va.">Wheeling</a> on September 8, and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> calls it a pirogue. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> correspondence during this period is of little help in sorting this out.
