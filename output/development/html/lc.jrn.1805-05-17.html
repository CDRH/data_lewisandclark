Set out at an early hour, and proceeded on very well; we employed the toe line the greater part of the day; the banks were firm and shore boald which favoured the uce of the cord. I find this method of asscending the river, when the shore is such as will permit it, the safest and most expeditious mode of traveling, except with sails in a steady and favourable breze. The country rugged, the hills high, their summits and sides partially covered with pine and cedar, and the river on either side washing their bases.    it is somewhat singular that the lower part of these hills appear to be formed of a dark rich loam while the upper region about 150 feet is formed of a whiteish brown sand, so hard in many parts as to resemble stone; but little rock or stone of any kind to be seen in these hills. <a href="#n13051701" id="ln13051701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    the river is much narrower than usual, the bed from 200 to 300 yards only and possessing a much larger proportion of gravel than usual. a few scattering cottonwood trees are the only timber near the river; the sandbars, and with them the willow points have almost entirely disappeared.    greater appearance than usual of the saline incrustations of the banks and river hills.    we passed two creeks <a href="#n13051702" id="ln13051702" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the one on Stard. side, and the other just below our camp on the Lard. side; <a href="#n13051703" id="ln13051703" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> each of these creeks afford a small quantity of runing water, of a brackish tast.    the great number of large beds of streams perfectly dry which we daily pass indicate a country but badly watered, which I fear is the case with the country through which we have been passing for the last fifteen or twenty days. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> walked on shore this evening and killed an Elk; buffaloe are not so abundant as they were some days past.    the party with me killed a female brown bear, she was but meagre, and appeared to have suckled young very recently. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

at a distance resemble ancient steeples.
