In the forenoon we finished 3 rooms of our cabins, all but the covering; which I expect will be a difficult part of the business, as we have not yet found any timber which splits well; two men went out to make some boards, if possible, for our roofs. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon a number of the natives from the seashore came to our camp, <a href="#n26121205" id="ln26121205" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and remained all night. Some rain fell in the evening.
