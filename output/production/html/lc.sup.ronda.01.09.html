            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> left <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> late in March 1806, their exploring duties were far from over. Ahead loomed responsibilities every bit as challenging as those that had driven the explorers up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and across the mountains nearly two years before. During the winter, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had heard from Indian sources about a river that struck south from the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and reached the "<span class="tei_name">gulph of California</span>." Finding that river, known to both Indians and explorers as the <span class="tei_name">Multinomah</span>, raised the expedition's hopes for a trade connection into the Southwest. Equally important were charting the northern course of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> and exploring the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>. Finally, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> needed to verify Indian information concerning a shorter route between <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. All that exploring would demand skill and coordination in field operations beyond anything yet attempted by the Corps of Discovery.</p>
               <p>
But in all these intricate maneuvers, Indian matters were not forgotten. Promoting and encouraging intertribal peace as a requisite for trade was a goal from the earliest days of the journey. On the return, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> needed to foster such notions, often in the face of long-standing tradition. Equally important was the complex matter of organizing delegations of Indians to visit federal officials in <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. Like intertribal peace, this accomplishment hinged on neutralizing "the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   menace." Finally, there were ethnographic tasks yet undone. In their hurry to reach the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had not carefully studied the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   people. Time spent with those Indians would allow the American ethnographers to record aspects of their life and culture.</p>
               <p>
Speed, timing, and survival were essential for success in all these efforts. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were determined to reach <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> in one season of travel, with careful planning and good fortune. The explorers had to work their way back up a floodstage <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> even more hazardous than before, avoid Indian complications at the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> and <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>, and reach their horses at the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   villages before those Indians left for summer hunts. Delays caused by snow on the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> could throw their schedules seriously off track. Finally, and no small matter, several field parties had to be coordinated to reach the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> before freeze-up. All told, the return journey presented challenges and opportunities as great as any the expedition had yet faced.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
The cold, wet days of spring on the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> did nothing to boost the men's spirits as they struggled back upriver. And struggle they did, since the river ran higher and faster than in the fall of 1805. Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found friendly treatment at several <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> villages along the lower <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, there were already unsettling signs. The expedition was intent on finding the <span class="tei_name">Multnomah River</span>, but information from the Indians on the short, shallow character of the <span class="tei_name">Quicksand (Sandy)</span> and <span class="tei_name">Seal (Washougal)</span> rivers was troubling. A brief reconnaissance of those rivers by <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Pryor</span> verified those disappointing reports.</p>
               <p>
But that disappointment could not match the real concern produced by news from Indians coming downriver from <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had expected to supplement the expedition's food stores with pounded salmon purchased from <span class="tei_name">Wishram and Wasco</span> traders. Now that plan was in doubt as party after party told of scarcities of food and even starvation upriver. "This information," said <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> with considerable understatement, "gave us much uneasiness with rispect to our future means of subsistence." Quickly rejecting a time-consuming wait at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> for the first salmon run, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided to remain at their camp on the north side of the river while laying in a supply of dried meat sufficient for the journey to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . Such a halt would also afford <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> time to extend his search for the elusive <span class="tei_name">Multnomah River</span>. <a href="#n0901" id="ln0901" class="ref_link"><sup>[01]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On April 2, with expeditionary hunters out on resupply missions, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> resumed his quest for the <span class="tei_name">Multnomah</span>. That effort was materially advanced when several <span class="tei_name">Watlala Indians</span> came to camp to trade. With them were two young men from one of the bands living on the <span class="tei_name">Willamette</span>, the river <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would eventually select as his <span class="tei_name">Multnomah</span>. From these men he obtained a sketch of the river and directions to find its mouth. Convinced this was the true object of his search, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hired an Indian pilot and took seven men to reconnoiter the <span class="tei_name">Willamette</span>. Before reaching the entrance of the river, blocked from earlier view by <span class="tei_name">Sauvies Island</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> landed at the large <span class="tei_name">Neerchekioo village</span>. As was so often the case with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ethnography, it is not clear whether this name refers to a location, a village, or a band. The captains further confused things by describing town residents as the <span class="tei_name">Neerchkioo</span> tribe of the <span class="tei_name">Shahhala (Watlala)</span> nation. The village site was dominated by a large plank house, with more than one hundred cutwater canoes "piled up and scattered in different directions about in the woods."</p>
               <p>
Exploring the <span class="tei_name">Willamette</span> was <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> principal objective, but seeing so imposing a plank house piqued his curiosity. That there might be some wappato for exchange could not have been far from his mind as well. Plank houses of this size were usually partitioned into several "apartments." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> entered one of the rooms and offered goods in trade for wappato. He met stony silence, "sulkey" faces, and a firm rejection of his offer. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> mood is hard to guess. What he did next may have been practical joking or the reflection of more hostile feelings. Taking a piece of cannon fuse from his pocket, the explorer tossed it into the fire. As the fuse sputtered and the fire changed color, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> used a magnet on his inkstand to make a compass needle spin around the rose. "Astonished and alarmed," the Indian women pleaded for him to restore their "healthy" fire. They hastily put several parcels of wappato at his feet. Throughout this display of technological wizardry, an old blind shaman had been "speaking with great vehemunce," calling on spirit forces to protect the village. The drama ended when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> belatedly paid the women for the wappato. <a href="#n0902" id="ln0902" class="ref_link"><sup>[02]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
For all its color and comic overtones, this incident at <span class="tei_name">Neerchekioo</span> does have a grimmer side. In light of the canoe-stealing episode in the last days at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> actions in the plank house suggest an increasing willingness to bend the rules whenever it suited the expedition's needs. Frightening and intimidating women and an elderly blind man did little to enhance the honor or the reputation of men who had set a high standard of conduct for themselves and others.</p>
               <p>
By the second week of April, the expedition had moved farther up the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and was now in position for its first major river challenge—the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> portage. That long and difficult carry was more than a dangerous trek around boiling rapids. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew, the <span class="tei_name">Watlala Indians</span> of the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> resented the presence of any outsiders who even appeared to threaten their control at this place on the river trade system. Harrassment, hostility, and petty theft were all part of the toll <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> folk extracted from all travelers. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not exempt from that tariff. As the Americans labored up the north shore, against swift current and over high boulders, they met Indians increasingly "sulky and illy disposed." Everything pointed to a portage physically taxing and emotionally trying. One false step could mean canoes and goods irretrievably lost; an overreaction to Indian provocation could have fatal results. <a href="#n0903" id="ln0903" class="ref_link"><sup>[03]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Friday, April 11, proved the crucial day for the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> portage. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was in charge of the actual portaging operation while <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> remained at a base camp at the lower end of the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span>. The captains elected to guide empty canoes through the rapids by means of ropes from the shore. Goods had to be transported over a narrow, rough, and slippery path nearly three thousand yards long. Even without Indian troubles, it was a demanding and nerve-racking task. No sooner had the portage begun than the <span class="tei_name">Watlalas</span> commenced their delaying tactics. So many Indians crowded around the base camp that several extra men had to be assigned to guard duty. The harrassment increased when one particularly bold Indian began throwing stones down on two men in the portage party. <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span>, who had taken some extra time at the head of the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> to buy a dog, suddenly found himself the object of the <span class="tei_name">Watlalas'</span> attention. When several Indians attempted to take his future meal and push him off the portage path, <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> drew his knife in readiness for something more than a polite scuffle. Seeing his determined resistence, the native highwaymen fled. Even <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> did not escape his share of trouble. Three <span class="tei_name">Watlalas</span> slipped into his camp at dusk, and before he could stop them, they had absconded with the dog <span class="tei_name">Scannon</span>. Absolutely furious, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered three men to give chase and use all necessary force to rescue <span class="tei_name">Scannon</span>. Gunplay was fortunately avoided as the Indians released the dog when they saw armed explorers in hot pursuit. Not even the reassurances of a <span class="tei_name">Watlala</span> chief that these were the unsanctioned exploits of "two very bad men" and "not the wish of the nation" could mollify the Americans. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ordered the sentries to shoot any Indian who dared steal the expedition's property. The <span class="tei_name">Watlalas</span> may have seen this all as a baiting game, but an edgy <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> did not share that view. "I am convinced," he wrote, betraying both worry and belligerence, "that no other consideration but our number at this moment protects us." <a href="#n0904" id="ln0904" class="ref_link"><sup>[04]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The following day there was less tension with <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> natives. Guards armed with short rifles perhaps convinced them that their toll price was simply too high. But the rapids demanded its own fee as one American craft was caught in the current, slammed against a large rock, and sank. At the end of another cold, rainy day the expedition had passed the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span>. Considering his anger earlier in the day, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> completed the portage quietly, taking a <span class="tei_name">Watlala</span> vocabulary and carefully noting some of the differences between upper and lower <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> dialects. <a href="#n0905" id="ln0905" class="ref_link"><sup>[05]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In many ways the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span> portage was a dress rehearsal for the tensions and troubles that lay ahead at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew from their westward journey that Indians at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> might prove difficult. When last at the <span class="tei_name">Narrows</span>, the expedition had attracted relatively few curious Indians. Now in mid-April, with the first salmon run not far off, <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> was crowded with people. On April 15, after establishing <span class="tei_name">Rock Fort Camp</span> at the lower end of <span class="tei_name">Long Narrows</span>, the explorers settled in to pursue portage and trade duties. Convinced that an overland route to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   villages would save considerable time, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> prepared to do some horse swapping. To speed that trade, it was decided that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would set up a temporary trading post on the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> would remain to oversee packing and portaging operations from <span class="tei_name">Rock Fort Camp</span>. <a href="#n0906" id="ln0906" class="ref_link"><sup>[06]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
With those decisions made, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, and nine other men across to the north shore. Horse trading had never been one of the expedition's strengths. Despite the fact that the frontiersmen knew good horseflesh when they saw it, they were usually at the mercy of native sellers who could set price and supply at will. The Indians who watched <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party make camp showed little or no interest in trade. Concerned at how poorly business was faring, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> detailed <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Frazer</span> to visit the <span class="tei_name">Chilluckquittequaw</span> village while <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span> went to the <span class="tei_name">Skilloots</span> to drum up business. <a href="#n0907" id="ln0907" class="ref_link"><sup>[07]</sup></a> These ventures produced scant results. Only <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> returned with any prospects, bringing a lame <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> chief who promised some trade. The chief's presence produced a few nibbles at <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> merchandise, but the high price placed on horses made setting the hook nearly impossible. Faced with discouraging news, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> cautiously accepted the <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> chief's invitation to visit his village. That night <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party was at the <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> camp. The explorers may have been pleased by the sight of so many fine horses. The whine of <span class="tei_name">Cruzatte's</span> fiddle and the stomp of dancing feet perhaps fostered hopes that <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> passage might not be so trying after all. But <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> experienced other and less favorable omens that night: he was bitten and chewed by "the mice and vermin with which this house abounded." <a href="#n0908" id="ln0908" class="ref_link"><sup>[08]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Anticipation overcame the weariness of a restless night, and the next morning <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> eagerly laid out his goods on a nearby rock. They had been carefully packaged into individual parcels, one bundle offered for each horse. But his best efforts at creative merchandising went awry. Making and then promptly breaking agreements, the Indians "tenterlised" a frustrated <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>. By the end of the day, he was worn out and ready to quit the <span class="tei_name">Skilloots</span>. Only word that more horses might be brought in convinced him to stay another day. And there was a second and more heartening piece of news. As the <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> trade languished during the afternoon, a chief and twenty people from the Sahaptian-speaking <span class="tei_name">Eneeshur</span> village appeared and promised good horses at low prices. For a man who had struggled all day to buy three horses, of which only one was a fit animal, the <span class="tei_name">Eneeshurs'</span> word was indeed welcome. Encouraged or not, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was willing to stay at the <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> village one more day in the hope that the winds of trade might shift. <a href="#n0909" id="ln0909" class="ref_link"><sup>[09]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Horse trading on April 18 proved no better than on earlier days. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had pinned his hopes on the <span class="tei_name">Eneeshurs</span> now that <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> sellers persisted in demanding high prices. Those hopes received a sharp check early in the day when an <span class="tei_name">Eneeshur</span> party arrived and, to <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> great "estonishment," announced that all trade understandings were off. Not about to give up, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> fell back on his doctoring talents to change the market climate. He offered salve for the chief's sores, gave "some small things" to his children, and ministered camphor and warm flannel to the ailing back of the "sulky Bitch" who was the chief's wife. Just as medical skills had proved a powerful force in dealing with other Indians, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found the <span class="tei_name">Eneershurs'</span> sales resistance lessening. But only two more horses were forthcoming. At prices double what 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   traders had asked, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have wondered if the expedition's corral would ever hold enough horses for the journey to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had not slept in two days; when he collapsed in exhaustion at <span class="tei_name">Rock Fort Camp</span>, his timetables were falling steadily behind. <a href="#n0910" id="ln0910" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Throughout the next three days, expedition hands labored to drive packhorses and haul goods over <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> portage. Although that effort moved slowly, it was at least successful. The same could not be said for the continuing effort to swell the horse herd. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> moved his trading post to the <span class="tei_name">Eneeshur</span> village above the <span class="tei_name">Short Narrows</span> and admitted that he used "every artifice decent and even false statements to enduce those pore devils to sell me horses." He unsuccessfully offered for each horse the full range of remaining trade items, including blankets, face paint, ribbon, beads, and brass. For a sweetener, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> threw in his own large blue blanket, military coat, sword, and hat plume. All of that was to no avail because the canny <span class="tei_name">Eneeshurs</span> demanded cooking kettles for horses. In an outburst that revealed mounting frustration and worry, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> bitterly described the people of <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> as "poor, dirty, proud, haughty, inhospitable, parsimonious, and faithless in every rispect." <a href="#n0911" id="ln0911" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As incidents of petty theft and harrassment increased, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> struggled to escape the grip of <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>. The last two days at the <span class="tei_name">Narrows</span>, April 21 and 22, held more unpleasantness with Indians than any comparable time in the history of the expedition. Determined to deny the Indians even castoff items, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered canoes, poles, and paddles burned. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spotted an Indian taking one of the iron sockets from a canoe pole, the captain dealt him several blows and ordered the offender kicked out of camp. All the pent-up rage bred by days of trouble boiled over. "I now informed the Indians that I would shoot the first of them that attempted to steal an article from us; that we were not afraid to fight them, that I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses, but it was not my wish to treat them with severity provided they would let my property alone. That I would take their horses if I could find out the persons who had stolen the tommahawks but that I had rather lose the property altogether than take the horse of an innocent person." Just how much of this speech was understood is not clear. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> exercise in spleen was perhaps more an index of the expedition's anxiety over homeward schedules than an overeager desire to burn and kill Indians. Punching one thief and shouting some ill-considered threats was not especially noble behavior, but there was sufficient provocation and confusion on both sides to make <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> words and deeds at least understandable.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> fared no better. Stuck at the <span class="tei_name">Eneeshur</span> village until <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> main party came up, he was surrounded by Indians who showed little regard for either his mission or his comfort. The captain's day was miserable as the <span class="tei_name">Eneeshurs</span> crowded around him, demanded tobacco, and made uncharitable remarks about his person. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> sole achievement was a chance meeting with a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   man who lent him a horse and promised to guide the party on their overland route to the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater River</span>. <a href="#n0912" id="ln0912" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
               </p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could not break free from <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> without one last incident. On April 22, as the expedition prepared to leave its camp at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Deschutes River</span> and begin an overland trek, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> was caught in a final entanglement. The Frenchman's horse bolted, threw its rider, and ran off toward one of <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> villages. As the horse neared the village, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau's</span> saddle and pad slid from the animal's back. The pad was evidently picked up by an Indian who then denied having it. This seemed the final insult, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> quickly renewed his promise to put the torch to nearby mat lodges unless the robe was returned. On the ragged edge of exasperation and fatigue, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> declared, "They have vexed me in such a manner by such repeated acts of villany that I am quite disposed to treat them with every severyty, their defenseless state pleads forgiveness so far as respects their lives." <a href="#n0913" id="ln0913" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> But once again the storm blew over and the captain's rhetoric was not translated into reality.</p>

               <p>
Finally beyond the reach of <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>, the expedition marched along the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> through rocky, sandy country. Guided by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   who had earlier offered his services to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and aided by the presence of an additional 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   family, the expedition headed toward the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span> and their friendly chief <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span>. Progress was slowed by too few packhorses and, inevitably, the travelers' sore feet and twisted ankles. Such now-familiar hazards were soothed when they reached the camps of the convivial <span class="tei_name">Klikitats</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pishquitpahs</span>. <a href="#n0914" id="ln0914" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Those evenings with them were filled with fiddling, dancing, and the sort of good times the explorers had not experienced for a long time.</p>
               <p>
Four days after slipping free from <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finally met <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span>. Encountering the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span> symbolized the end of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> passage. It also meant that the mountains were ahead, and a time with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit's</span> village of fifteen large mat lodges was currently on the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> some twelve miles below the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span>-<span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> confluence. Eager to show his pleasure at seeing the Americans, <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span> delivered a long speech enjoining his people to welcome the strangers. The chief then went about gathering food and fuel to set an example of hospitality. Firewood and roasted fish were valuable but even more precious was information offered by the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span> on the best way to reach the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   camps on the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. <a href="#n0915" id="ln0915" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the westbound journey, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had not been able to spend much time with <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit's</span> folk but had promised to be more neighborly on the return. The chief, interested in gaining a prominent place in the American trade system, was not about to let that promise go unfulfilled. Early on the morning of April 28, he arrived at the expedition's camp with "a very eligant white horse" as a gift for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Like <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> traders, the chief had his eye on acquiring some kettles. Since the expedition was dangerously short on cooking pots, the Indian was offered instead <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> sword, one hundred rounds of ammunition, and some trade goods. If the captains thought this exchange would satisfy <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span> and the expedition might then cross the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, they were mistaken.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Walula</span> chief was not ready to let <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> slip so easily from his grasp. He was willing to provide horses, food, canoes, and information but his price called for the Americans to stay in camp for at least an extra day. <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span> artfully recalled the promise made a year ago. An extra day spent with him would hardly make any difference in travel plans. Just how much the presence of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> meant to <span class="tei_name">Walula</span> prestige became plain when <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span> revealed that he had invited a large party of <span class="tei_name">Yakimams</span> for a grand feast and dance. Once again, the explorers proved the greatest tourist attraction in western America. Sensing that it would be both impolitic and impolite to disappoint <span class="tei_name">Yelleppit</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> agreed to spend a day before attempting a river crossing. Talks with the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span> were simplified by the presence of a female 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   prisoner who provided the necessary translation link between <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and the Sahaptian-speaking <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span>. "We conversed with them," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "for several hours and fully satisfyed all their enquiries with rispect to ourselves and the objects of our pursuit." Throughout the day, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> practiced medicine, "a great wonder" to the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span>, as <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> noted. The day ended as a group of one hundred <span class="tei_name">Yakimas</span> came for an evening of dancing and singing, much of it led by a <span class="tei_name">Walula</span> shaman who declared that communication with the moon spirit had enabled him to predict the arrival of the Americans. In the firelight and shadow of that festive night, the entire expedition may have set aside their knowledge that the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroots</span> loomed ahead. <a href="#n0916" id="ln0916" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In the last days of April, the explorers crossed the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and began a northeastern trek toward the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span>-<span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> junction. They were now blessed with twenty-three "excellent young horses," most of them from the <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span>. By the first of May, they were along the <span class="tei_name">Touchet River</span> near present-day <span class="tei_name">Waitsburg</span>, <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. Two days later, up <span class="tei_name">Pataha Creek</span> east of present-day <span class="tei_name">Pomeroy</span>, <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>, the expedition met a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   known to them as <span class="tei_name">Wearkkoomt</span>. More properly named <span class="tei_name">Apash Wyakaikt</span> or <span class="tei_name">Flint Necklace</span>, he had heard that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were on the way and was eager to greet them. Although their journals did not mention it at the time, <span class="tei_name">Apash Wyakaikt</span> had evidently gone by land ahead of the expedition in October 1805 to announce their arrival at the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span>-<span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> confluence. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was convinced that those efforts were "very instrumental in procuring us a hospitable and friendly reception among those natives." Not even rain, snow, hail, and scanty rations could diminish what must have been the expedition's pleasure at knowing they would soon be with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   on the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. <a href="#n0917" id="ln0917" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The weather and the dog-meat rations did not improve as the explorers slowly made their way toward the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. In the hard going of steep and narrow paths, men and animals slipped and stumbled. One packhorse loaded with irreplaceable ammunition fell into a creek, but that mysterious <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> luck held and neither horse nor load was damaged. In the afternoon of May 4, the party arrived at the lodges of another 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   familiar from a year before. <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span>, along with <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>, had provided invaluable help on the westward voyage. From <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky's</span> kin, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> now learned that they should cross the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span> at this point and then follow the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> on the northeast side to where <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> had pastured the expedition's herd of horses. Knowing that more horses were close by may have improved morale, dampened by a night so cold and disagreeable that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   huddled around <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> fire "in great numbers insomuch that we could scarcely cook or keep ourselves warm." <a href="#n0918" id="ln0918" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the following day, May 5, the explorers plodded along the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. Their enquiries at 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   mat lodges for food found the larders nearly bare. And many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   resented the way the strangers crowded into the lodges, disregarding both etiquette and their obvious poverty. But at one of the lodges <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found an unexpected ally. On the westbound journey, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had done a good deal of doctoring among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . One of those he had medicated had "never ceased to extol the virtues of our medicines and the skill of my friend <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> as a phisician." Ointments and salves now proved powerful agents as dozens of ailing 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   began to line up for consultations with "their favorite phisician." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> doubted the efficacy of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> medicine chest but justified "this deception for they will not give us any provision without compensation in merchandize and our stock is now reduced to a mere handfull."</p>
               <p>
Provisions, especially dog meat, were what the expedition desperately needed. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   did not usually eat dog and found it amusing that the explorers relished it. That amusement very nearly sparked a serious argument when a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   prankster "very impertinently" threw a scrawny puppy toward <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Angered by the act and the general laughter it provoked, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> caught the dog and threw it back at the Indian "with great violence." At the same time, the explorer brandished his tomahawk and made signs that if another dog grew wings the Indian would suffer for it. With undisguised arrogance, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> recorded that he then continued lunch "<span class="italic">on dog</span>" without further interruption.</p>
               <p>
Later that afternoon, the expedition reached a large mat lodge measuring 15 by 156 feet. Holding thirty families, this 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   long house was home to many in the band of <span class="tei_name">Neeshneparkkeook, or Cutnose</span>, who had gotten his name as the result of a wound suffered in combat with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Although not especially impressed with either his physique or his intelligence, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> a small medal. Perhaps more important, the explorers met a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   taken prisoner by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . With this man as translator, it was now possible to have direct talks with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   without relying on signs. The first piece of information that came from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   translator was worrisome. He indicated that at least one 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   elder believed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were "bad men and had come to kill them." Knowing that such rumors had to be squelched, the captains were pleased when <span class="tei_name">Flint Necklace</span> rejoined the party. <a href="#n0919" id="ln0919" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
For the next two days, the expedition traveled east along the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. As before, those were days of slim rations. Horses traded for <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> eyewash were quickly butchered. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also had time to record accurate descriptions of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   clothing, burial practices, and hunting techniques. But just beneath that travel routine was some very disturbing news, something beyond horses or diplomacy. Everyone in the party could now see that the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroots</span> were covered with snow, an observation confirmed by several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   who reported, "The snow is yet so deep on the mountains that we shall not be able to pass them until after the next full moon or about the first of June." Describing this as "unwelcome intiligence," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted that the diet of horsemeat and roots already had most of the expedition dreaming of those "fat plains of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>" and home. <a href="#n0920" id="ln0920" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
It was not until the afternoon of May 8, some miles south of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>, that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found lodges belonging to <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>. The captains expected to see not only him but horses as well. What greeted them instead was a long-simmering quarrel between <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span>. No sooner had the explorers met <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> than he began to speak in a loud and angry voice. <span class="tei_name">Cutnose's</span> reply was equally heated. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not immediately understand the cause of the dispute but quickly realized that any delay in finding their horses might be serious. Moving to cut off the argument, the captains announced that they were going to march on to the first good water and bed down for the night. Hoping to reconcile them, they invited both <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> to come along.</p>
               <p>
Once at their evening camp, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> acted to mediate between the two quarrelling Indians. During the past several days, the explorers had heard rumors that their horses were scattered and the saddle and tack cache damaged. Putting <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> on good terms might clear the air and make rounding up the horses much easier. Because the young 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   interpreter refused to take part in what he said was not his affair, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had to rely on signs to mollify both parties. After <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> found <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>, the explorers listened first to his explanation. <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> claimed that no sooner had he taken possession of the expedition's horses than <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tunnachemootoolt (Broken Arm)</span> returned from a raid against the <span class="tei_name">Shoshinis</span>. Angry and jealous of the prestige <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> had gained by his association with the Americans, <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> and <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> evidently had begun a long and wearing argument with the elderly Indian. Tired and upset by their complaints, <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> now admitted he had neglected the horses. Unsure how close to the truth his words were but unwilling to worsen a complex situation, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reminded the Indian that his reward of two guns and ammunition was still available if he would locate the missing horses. The captains then sent <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> to fetch <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span>. His story was predictably different. <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> charged that <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> was "a bad old man" who "woar two faces." According to <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span>, <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> had allowed several young men to ride expedition horses hard enough to injure them. <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> insisted that he and <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> had tried to protect the horses, but to no avail. Denied the services of their translator, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could neither ascertain the full truth nor resolve the quarrel. Prudence suggested staying with <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> one day to allow him time to bring in the horses and then moving on to <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> lodge to pay him proper due. <a href="#n0921" id="ln0921" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Letting each man tell his tale and giving at least surface credence to both was a happy compromise. On the following day, <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> sent two young men to bring in the expedition's horses. Although most were healthy, at least three showed signs of hard use. In the afternoon, <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Alexander Willard</span> went out to recover saddles, tack, powder, and lead from a cache built the previous year. Happily, there were signs that the row between <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span> had become a thing of the past. But against these good omens was the growing awareness that the expedition would be spending more time with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   than first anticipated. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> location on May 9 was unsuitable for a more permanent camp. Access to water, good pasture, and protection against weather and theft all required finding another site.</p>
               <p>
That the expedition had left <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> too soon became painfully evident when the explorers set out on May 10 for <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> village. With eight inches of snow on the ground, horses slipped repeatedly along the hazardous trail. It was not until late in the afternoon that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finally came down to <span class="tei_name">Lawyer's Canon Creek</span> and straggled into the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   settlement. Greeting them were an impressive 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   chief and his people, framed by a large mat lodge and an American flag left behind the previous year. Cold and hungry, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> asked <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> help to restock the expedition's supplies. The chief responded by bringing roots and dried salmon, food that stirred memoires of agonizing indigestion and dysentery. He then graciously promised as many horses as needed for fresh meat.</p>
               <p>
While all this menu-planning was going on, the stage was being set for preliminary talks with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . Those councils moved a step closer when an important chief <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called <span class="tei_name">Hohastillpilp</span> arrived at <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> village with a party of fifty mounted warriors. More properly known as <span class="tei_name">Hohots Ilppilp</span> or the <span class="tei_name">Bloody Chief</span>, his village was some six miles away near the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. With <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span>, <span class="tei_name">Cutnose</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hohots Ilppilp</span> present, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided to begin serious talks. <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hohots Ilppilp</span> were first given medals. Using their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   interpreter, the explorers explained "the design and the importance of medals in the estimation of the whites as well as the red men who had been taught their value." Impressed by all this, and with his eye on gaining things more precious than medals, <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> led the explorers to a council tepee. With a crowd of Indians packed into the lodge, everyone spent the rest of the evening eating prime horsemeat, smoking friendly pipes, and talking in a mixture of phrases and signs that were hastily translated. This council seemed to promise the kind of diplomatic success that had so often eluded <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <a href="#n0922" id="ln0922" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Early talks with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   chiefs prepared the way for two days of serious diplomatic exchange on May 11 and 12. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were unsure of their agenda at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, they were more certain of their negotiating priorities with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   and other plateau peoples. Participation in the American trade system, intertribal peace, and delegations of notables destined for the president's reception room were all on the list of subjects to be broached with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . It was an agenda that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed applicable to every native group. That such diplomacy—especially the dangerous practice of promising arms to traditional enemies—might have unforeseen and unpleasant consequences had not yet become plain to the Corps of Discovery diplomats.</p>
               <p>
With the arrival of <span class="tei_name">Yoomparkkartim (Five Big Hearts)</span>, "a chief of great note," all major 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   headmen in the immediate area were present. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never lacked a flair for the dramatic, no matter how understated their journal entries. Borrowing from native cartographic techniques, the captains began the grand council by drawing a map of the country with charcoal on a stretched hide. Smoking, gift-giving, and the mapping revealed just how much the explorers had learned of Indian protocol. If past experience proved any guide, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was responsible for making the formal presentation. Although his remarks were short and uncomplicated, translations proved "tedious" as every word passed through English, French, <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   speakers. Half the day was taken up getting <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> message across to the patient chiefs. The American officer presented four closely related points. Establishing trading posts, instituting intertribal peace, and preparing delegations were a trio of themes that had been repeated since the earliest days on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. The issue of American sovereignty was an unspoken part of the talks, although what had been said the previous day about the design and meaning of medals suggests that thoughts of sovereignty were not far from the Americans' minds. But there was a final point in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> presentation that was both spoken and demonstrated. Throughout their long voyage <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were always at pains to show as forcefully as possible the military prowess and technological strength of the new republic. Parades, keelboat curiosities, telescopes, mirrors, and the omnipresent airgun were all for that purpose. "After the council was over," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "we amused ourselves with showing them the power of magnatism, the spy glass, compass, watch, air gun and sundry other articles equally novel and incomprehensible to them." When one young and important warrior told the captains that he had "opened his ears to our councils and that our words had made his heart glad," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have believed that a major diplomatic victory was in the offing. <a href="#n0923" id="ln0923" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The captains understood enough Indian political and diplomatic practice to realize that no immediate answer to the American plans could be expected. There had to be time for talk and a ceremonial acceptance of a consensus that was ultimately binding on none. Throughout the morning of Monday, May 12, chiefs and elders spoke their minds in a council that eventually proved to have far-reaching consequences for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   people. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   leaders assembled at <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> village certainly understood what was at stake. By 1806 there were about four thousand 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   living in several autonomous bands. The predictable rhythms of their lives were increasingly challenged by the flood of firearms falling into the hands of <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> and <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> warriors. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   situation was similar to that of <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Both peoples desperately needed a place in the American trade system, if only to obtain guns and ammunition. In a plains and plateau world undergoing profound change, links to American traders promised what must have seemed cheap security. Several hours of talk behind him, <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> emerged and set in motion one of the most dramatic moments in expedition history. Taking flour made from cous roots, the chief made a thick mush and then ladled it into "the kettles and baskets of all his people." After a long speech in which he explained the decisions reached in council, <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> called on all who accepted those decisions to eat the mush. In a colorful line, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> observed, "All swallowed their objections if any they had very cheerfully with their mush." This was done to a background of women crying and tearing their hair, perhaps sensing that links with the strangers might bring unequal measures of safety and danger.</p>
               <p>
With ritual acceptance of the council's decisions, it was time for the Indians to present formally their views to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Because so many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   required medical attention, the captains decided that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would spend the rest of the day doctoring while <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> pursued his diplomacy. The official orator for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   was the elderly father of <span class="tei_name">Hohots Ilppilp</span>, a man of considerable prestige and political skill. Declaring that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   now spoke with one heart and one mind, the old speaker presented a perceptive, critical evaluation of American proposals and native needs. He agreed that peace with neighboring tribes had real advantages. As if to underscore the unity of American and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   policies, he reported that in the summer of 1805 a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   delegation had gone to parley with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   along the <span class="tei_name">Snake River</span>. But those emissaries had been killed by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   warriors and the resulting raid against the <span class="tei_name">Snake River</span> people had counted forty-two 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   dead and only three 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   casualties. The blood of the slain peacemakers had been properly revenged and peace was now possible. But whether the old man meant peace as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> understood it or a temporary truce remained unclear. As they had along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the explorer-diplomats unthinkingly assumed that "peace" meant the same thing on both sides of the cultural divide.</p>
               <p>
As the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   leadership understood it, the real issue was trade and security. Access to guns symbolized their concern. Speaking to that complex matter, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   orator declared that his people were willing to travel on to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> plains for trade. However, no 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   was prepared to make such a trading journey unless there were solid assurances that <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> and <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> warriors were not lying in ambush along the trail. All of this meant arming the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   and making peace with those plains warriors already well armed by Canadian traders. That these two objectives were mutually exclusive may have been evident to some 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   but not to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The old speaker pledged everlasting friendship to the Americans, saying that although the bands were poor, "their hearts were good." There may have been plenty of "good hearts" in evidence, but what the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   really wanted were guns. As for a delegation to the Federal City, that issue was unresolved. If the Americans could deliver weapons, then perhaps a long journey to see the chief of the seventeen fires would be worth the trouble and danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> fullest day of diplomacy since talks with <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> ended with a flurry of eating, singing, dancing, and gambling. Pipes were passed, more gifts-exchanged, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> continued his medical ministrations. But in all this play and good feeling, there was one activity that especially fascinated many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   warriors. Firing rifles at targets drew their attention. The presence of native visitors on the weapons range was a clear indication of what lay behind so much of the talk during that day. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> struck the mark twice from a range of 220 yards, those warriors could not help but be impressed with the weapons that might soon be in their hands. <a href="#n0924" id="ln0924" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that their major diplomatic objectives with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   had been accomplished. After the talks, they were increasingly concerned with the problem of deep snows in the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroots</span>. During the grand council, there were further reports that the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> would not be passable for at least another month. Any hope of a quick passage over the mountains was now gone. A site had to be found for a camp among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , and arrangements had to be made for guides once the trail was open. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped that by inviting <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair's</span> family to live nearby, guides from his household might be hired. Following suggestions from several chiefs, they located a camping place along the north bank of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater River</span> near modern-day <span class="tei_name">Kamiah</span>, <span class="tei_name">Idaho</span>. This was an especially favorable site, providing access to good hunting grounds, fine pasture for horses, and the river when the salmon finally ran. The expedition's baggage was stored in the center of a depression made by an abandoned winter pit lodge. Although the expedition spent nearly a month (May 14–June 10, 1806) at this spot, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never gave the camp a formal name. Tradition has called it <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish, Long Camp, or Camp Kamiah</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> placed his seal of approval on the location by declaring himself "perfectly satisfied with our position." <a href="#n0925" id="ln0925" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> was never much more than a collection of leaky brush wickiups, luggage pens, and a makeshift horse corral, it was the center of busy activity. Day by day there were more Indians who found a welcome at <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> than at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. Contacts with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   ranged from trade and medicine to sport and sex. As they waited for snows to melt up in the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroots</span>, members of the expedition developed close ties with these Indians.</p>
               <p>
Despite the best efforts of expeditionary hunters led by <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>, it was plain by early May that a reliable trade in foodstuffs had to be established with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   villages. It was this trade that most often provided common ground for explorer and Indian. What to offer for stocks of camas and cous roots and the much-sought-after cous bread proved a serious problem. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   tastes in trade goods did not run to "baubles," as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> called them. Beads, armbands, and other luxury items failed to attract much attention. The practical 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   sought knives, kettles, blankets, and moccasin awls. But the expedition's supplies of those tools and utensils were short, and if <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped to foster a dependable trade, canny substitutions had to be found. <a href="#n0926" id="ln0926" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By mid-May, as the expedition's hunting fortunes further declined, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> organized trading parties to visit the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   villages. Typical of those ventures was the first mission to <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> village. <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>, <span class="tei_name">John Thompson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Peter Wiser</span>, <span class="tei_name">John Potts</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hugh Hall</span> were given moccasin awls, knitting pins, and brass armbands to exchange for cous roots and bread. After a day of haggling, "our marketers" returned near dark with six bushels of roots and bread. On May 20, <span class="tei_name">Frazer</span> was sent on the second trade foray. He reported that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   were apparently ready to depart from their usual utilitarian demands and might be wooed with brass uniform buttons. Buttons promptly vanished from the expedition's clothing as each man gathered what he could to make trade bargains. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> evidently feared that such a scramble might produce economic chaos and reduced morale. On May 21, the captains collected all the remaining goods and carefully parceled them out to each man. Every member of the Corps of Discovery was given one awl, one knitting pin, half an ounce of vermilion paint, two needles, a few skeins of thread, and one yard of ribbon. With this "slender stock," each man was to make any agreements he could to obtain the food necessary for the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> passage. <a href="#n0927" id="ln0927" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In the last days of May, small expedition parties made regular trips to Indian camps along the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. Trading was often difficult as 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   folk soon learned that the laws of supply and demand favored them. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> admitted that roots and bread could only be bought "at a very dear rate." Hardpressed to meet 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   business demands, some men ingeniously fashioned moccasin awls from small links of a discarded chain. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   trade was not only difficult but dangerous as well. When <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Lepage</span> went up the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> to trade at a village some eight miles away, they experienced, in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> words, "a broken voyage." Things began to go wrong for the two French traders when their packhorse slipped and fell into the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. Terrified, the horse bolted and swam across the river. An Indian on the opposite shore helpfully tried to drive the horse back toward the traders, but the pack cinches broke and precious cargo was lost. And to compound troubles, a raft loaded with roots destined for <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Lapage</span> struck a rock and capsized. "The river having fallen heir to both merchandize and roots," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> laconically, "our traders returned with empty hands." The troubles experienced by <span class="tei_name">Potts</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, and <span class="tei_name">John Collins</span> were far more serious. While attempting to cross the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>, their canoe caught the full force of the current and slammed into a tree. <span class="tei_name">Potts</span> was "an indifferent swimmer"; as he floundered in the river, the canoe quickly filled with water and sank. In the confusion three blankets, one blanket coat, and a supply of trade goods were lost. Efforts by <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and his men to raise the canoe and recover the goods failed. The loss of the blankets was indeed serious. As <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> explained, "The loss of these blankets is the greatest which hath happened to any individual since we began our voyage, as there are only three men in the party who have more than one blanket apiece." <a href="#n0928" id="ln0928" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By the first days of June, the expedition's stocks of trade items were nearly gone. High prices, accidents, and continued poor hunting made business with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   increasingly difficult and jeopardized the explorers along the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span>. "Having exhausted all our merchandize," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "we are obliged to have recourse to every subterfuge in order to prepare in the most ample manner in our power to meet that wretched portion of our journey, the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, where hungar and cold in their most rigorous forms assail the wearied traveller." Whether those "subterfuges" were the same as the tricks of trade employed by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> along the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> is not plain in the journals. What is recorded is a desperate effort to find any objects that might attract the Indians' attention. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> cut the buttons from their own coats and made up measures of several medications. Those goods, along with some unused phials and tin boxes, were given to <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> and <span class="tei_name">York</span>. When the two men returned bringing three bushels of roots and some cous bread, their success was "not much less pleasing to us than the return of a good cargo to an East India Merchant." <a href="#n0929" id="ln0929" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Less successful was a long trip undertaken by <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Frazer</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Wiser</span> to an Indian fishery at <span class="tei_name">Wild Goose Rapids</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Snake River</span> to trade for salmon. After a journey that lasted a week and covered some one hundred miles, <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> party returned with seventeen spoiled fish and a few cous roots. <a href="#n0930" id="ln0930" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Throughout the first week of June, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> continued to pursue the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   trade. Believing that snows would be sufficiently melted within the next two weeks, the explorers redoubled their efforts to stockpile food for the mountain passage. But these efforts were hampered by few goods for trade and the failure of salmon to run on the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. Nothing could be done about the tardy fish, but many men in the party used considerable imagination to create "little notions" from bits and pieces of worn files, spare bullets, and tattered fish nets. These ventures in product design evidently paid off, much to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> surprise. The captains, who had been so pessimistic a few days before, found that by June 6 the Corps had enough rations to dare the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span>. <a href="#n0931" id="ln0931" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a> The remaining trade centered on obtaining ropes for packsaddles, skin bags to hold provisions, and animal hair for saddle pads.</p>
               <p>
That the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   continued to have "good hearts" toward their <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> neighbors was the result of two expectations. Hope that ties to the Americans might bring a steady supply of trade goods, especially guns and ammunition, and some lessening of tensions with plains raiders clearly shaped the Indians' behavior. Only slightly less important for expedition–
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   relations were the medical services <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> provided to countless Indian men, women, and children. Just how interested the

                   were in his doctoring was evident even before <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> was established. As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> explained it, cures accomplished during the westbound journey "raised my reputation and gives those nativs an exolted oppinion of my skill a a phisician." Quickly realizing that much of their future comfort and security depended on

                   good will, the explorers were willing to continue the "deception" of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as the great healer. But <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was not without scruples, and he maintained: "We take care to give them no article which can possibly injure them, and in many cases can administer and give such medicine and sirgical aid as will effectually restore them in simple cases." <a href="#n0932" id="ln0932" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>

As the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  ' "favorite phisician," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had a waiting room filled with eager patients. Throughout the days at <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span>, he saw a wide variety of diseases and disorders. Most common were sore eyes, rheumatism, strained muscles, and abrasions. But there were also more demanding medical problems, including serious abscesses, mental depression, and "disorders intirely out of the power of Medison." Determined to do what he could for those "poor afflicted wretches," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> utilized simple medications and common-sense therapies. Those included various salves, elixirs, pills, and large quantities of eyewash. Laudanum (tincture of opium) was the most potent drug in the expedition's medicine chest. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also administered back rubs and on at least one occasion performed minor surgery on festering abscess. The fact that a party of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   once spent two days in the saddle to obtain some of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> famous eyewash is a reminder of how important his medical services were at <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span>. <a href="#n0933" id="ln0933" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Of all the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   cases seen by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, none was more dramatic or as well-documented as that of a paralyzed chief. This unnamed "chief of considerable note" first appeared at camp on May 11. With Clinical precision, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described the Indian's symptoms and speculated on the cause of his apparent paralysis. "This man is incapable of moveing a single limb but lies like a corps in whatever position he is placed, yet he eats hartily, dejests his food perfectly, enjoys his understanding. His pulse are good, and has retained his flesh almost perfectly; in short were it not that he appears a little pale from having been so long in the shade, he might well be taken for a man in good health. I suspect that their confinement to a diet of roots may give rise to all the disorders of the nativs of this quarter except the Rhumitsism and Sore eyes, and to the latter of those, the state of debility incident to a vegitable diet may measureable contribute." Although betraying a cultural preference for red meat in the diet, in every other way the diagnosis represents a skillful piece of physiological observation. <a href="#n0934" id="ln0934" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
With this case <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> learned the difference between successful diagnosis and effective therapy. The explorers were especially eager to provide good care for the chief. Success in treatment would further insure 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   hospitality and support. But in a case as complex as this, they were quite unsure how to proceed. Notions about diet as the root cause of the man's immobility offered slight guidance for a condition that had already lasted five years. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first prescribed "simple cooling medicenes" for the chief. When these failed and the chief's relatives persisted in hoping for a cure, he gave several doses of sulphur and cream of tartar and proposed a regimen of daily cold baths. But in all of this <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> admitted that he was at a loss to deturmine what to do for this unfortunate man." In desperation, he suggested a few drops of laudanum and the expedition's version of chicken soup, a watery broth made from portable soup. <a href="#n0935" id="ln0935" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
A breakthrough of sorts came on May 24. After giving a powerful sweat bath to chronically ill <span class="tei_name">William Bratton</span> and seeing its positive results, the captains decided to try the treatment on the chief. But the sweating hole dug for <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span> proved too small for the chief. Stymied but not ready to admit defeat, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> urged relatives to take the chief to their larger sweat lodges. And reflecting current medical interest in the possible healing effects of electricity, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> declared that the chief "would be an excellent subject for electricity" and regretted that "I have it not in my power to supply it." <a href="#n0936" id="ln0936" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have thought that, after his failure to sweat the chief, his advice to the anxious family might end the expedition's involvement. But <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> reputation was too powerful for that, and when both patient and family lingered in camp, he was compelled to once again prescribe sulphur and cream of tartar and urge that the stricken chief be be taken home. When the latter suggestion was strongly resisted, it was agreed to attempt a second sweat. On the following day, May 27, the chief's father carefully enlarged the sweat pit. The man was then lowered into the pit with ropes and, despite considerable pain, the therapy seemed promising.</p>
               <p>
In the days that followed, the heat treatments were repeated. To the surprise of all, the chief gradually recovered use of his arms and hands. By the end of May, the man was washing his face and was able to move his toes and legs. As the expedition prepared to leave <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> in early June, the chief continued to report progress. Whether his improvement was sustained is not known, but the efforts of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> in this difficult case reenforced the positive image of the explorers in the minds of many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . <a href="#n0937" id="ln0937" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>

               <p>
Busy with trade, medicine, and the demands of daily life, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> still found time to record something about the lives of their Indian hosts. As had become the rule in their ethnography, the explorers paid most attention to 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   material culture. In references scattered throughout the <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> entries, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> commented on a variety of topics. Eating habits, domestic architecture, hunting techniques, and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   passion for fine horses all found a place in their records. Clothing, saddles, and weapons were duly noted and described. Attitudes about old age, the protocol of diplomacy, and the custom of sacrificing horses at the death of a prominent person made the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   come alive in the journals. And the explorers took time to set down one vivid aural impression of native life. "The noise of their women pounding roots reminds me of a nail factory," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. <a href="#n0938" id="ln0938" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> was second only to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> as a place where Indians and explorers could enjoy each other's company. Although records for this period are neither as full nor as explicit as those kept at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, there is evidence strongly suggesting that the Americans stood "at ease" among the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> people. Finding much to admire in 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   customs, hospitality, and physique, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> felt comfortable enough to relax and enjoy some breathing time before assaulting the dreaded <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span>. There were times for fiddling, dancing, and singing. On several occasions, the expedition's hunters shared meat with hungry Indians. In return, the natives showed the Americans a remarkably infection-free method for gelding horses. Even at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> there had been bumps and scrapes in Indian-expedition relations. But if such troubles drifted into <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span>, they were so minor as to elude all journal keepers. <a href="#n0939" id="ln0939" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Even more elusive are the facts about sexual relations between men in the expedition and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   women. Among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , there were no strong sanctions for or against sex with whites. These plateau people used sex neither to seal trade bargains nor to gain spiritual power. The expedition's records during the winters with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> are filled with the pleasures and troubles of native affairs. But the <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> entries in all journals are oddly silent on what was from the beginning an accepted part of the life of the expedition. There seems little doubt that contacts more intimate than trading for roots took place during those early spring days. Sex usually made for good copy in the journals when it involved disease, personal trouble, or cultural misunderstanding. Since relations with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   were amiable, whatever personal encounters took place may well have been mutually satisfactory.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps the most intriguing piece of evidence to suggest the presence of such liaisons is a photograph taken by the noted western cameraman William H. Jackson. Before the 1877 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   War, Jackson encountered a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   band and was introduced to a blue-eyed, sandy-haired man claiming to be <span class="tei_name">William Clark's</span> son. Sufficiently impressed, Jackson photographed the man. The assertion that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> left a son behind along the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> persisted, and when Chief Joseph's band surrendered to General Nelson Miles in 1877, one of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   prisoners was pointed out as <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> son. Although in no way conclusive, the story does reveal the continued positive reputation of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   well into the nineteenth century. Whether this particular man was indeed <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> son or the child of another white explorer is beyond the power of existing historical evidence either to verify or deny. At the same time, the persistence of the tale hints at one more part of the physical life at <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span>. <a href="#n0940" id="ln0940" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Far less difficult to document were times of boisterous fun and athletic competition in what might be aptly described as the <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> Olympics. The men of the expedition had been selected, at least in part, for their sound constitutions. Despite long months of travel and often irregular diets, most remained in good condition. Their frontier and military backgrounds were filled with demanding physical conditioning as well as a tradition of competitive sports. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   men equally admired strong bodies and tests of skill and strength. Early in June, as the expedition prepared to leave camp, the explorers and Indians staged an impromptu series of athletic contests. There had already been some target shooting, and now foot races were added to the schedule. Matched against a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   team that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted was "very active" were sprinters <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>. But Indian runners proved very swift, and at least one was as fast as the best the Corps of Discovery had to offer. Following the races was a game <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described as "prison base," an activity much like "keep away" or "running bases." These good-natured competitions provided yet another chance for all in camp to enjoy simple pleasures. For the captains there was an additional benefit. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> explained it, with the mountain crossing drawing near, those men who had become "rather lazy and slouthfull" needed some rigorous exercise. <a href="#n0941" id="ln0941" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As May slipped into June and the time grew closer to leave <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span>, there were several diplomatic questions still unanswered. Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> certainly believed that most of the American proposals had been accepted, some issues had not yet received formal 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   replies. Those included the expedition's requests for guides beyond the mountains, a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   group to accompany <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> at least partway in his journey to negotiate with <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> and <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> bands, and a delegation to visit President <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>.</p>
               <p>
On June 4, as <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> and several other chiefs prepared to leave for their own villages, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reminded them of earlier promises to aid the expedition. The chiefs' reply revealed not so much second thoughts about an American trade and military alliance as some caution about the powers and abilities of untested new friends. <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> carefully declined the invitation for some young warriors to accompany <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> beyond <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span>, declaring that his hunters would not venture beyond the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroots</span> until late in the summer. He hinted that there was little hope for a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   delegation to go with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Although none of the chief's replies spelled defeat for American diplomacy, they did reveal a certain prudent wariness. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   wanted American guns and the security they promised, but there were always those cries of fearful women to counsel caution. <a href="#n0942" id="ln0942" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Not about to accept <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> words as a final answer, the captains decided to send <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and a small party to parley once again with the chief. Receiving the Americans with unfailing hospitality, <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> told <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> of the presence of many headmen from small and more distant villages who had not been at the grand council in early May. <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> had thoughtfully invited them and now asked <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to repeat to them the American plans. If <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped that a larger audience and a second chance to explain federal policy might change some minds, he was wrong. <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> repeated what he had said two days before: no large number of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   were about to accompany the expedition. The request for some warrior-diplomats to foster intertribal peace on the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span> could not be decided until a larger council met.</p>
               <p>
But <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> did not want <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to think the whole notion of peace with neighbors was now in doubt. The chief explained that, as a result of recent contacts with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   who desired peace with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Cayuse</span> bands, a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   delegation had been sent toward the <span class="tei_name">Snake River</span> to negotiate such an agreement. <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> promised he would never break that peace and to emphasize his good intentions presented <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> two ceremonial pipes—one a traditional 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   pipe for the explorers and the other a fancy plains pipe with silver inlays for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Knowing the significance of those pipes, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decorated the one destined for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   with blue ribbon and white wampum to symbolize a mutual desire for peace. As he made his way back to camp, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may well have noted that, although American policy now seemed on firmer ground, the immediate need for guides over the treacherous <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> was yet unmet. <a href="#n0943" id="ln0943" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>

From the first days at <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had maintained a close watch on snow conditions in the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroots</span>. The expedition's timetables called for a quick journey over the mountains. A long stay with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , no matter how pleasant, seriously endangered the homeward voyage. By the middle of May, both captains were looking for any sign to prove that the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> would soon be passable. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported: "I frequently consult the nativs on the subject of passing this tremendious barrier whic now present themselves to our view." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> anxiously eyed the level of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater River</span> for some hint that snows were melting. In a moment of frustration, he lashed out at "that icy barrier which seperates me from my friends and Country, from all which makes life esteemable—patience, patience." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> might well have counseled patience for himself and the whole party. Both 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   and expedition hunters reported deep snows that might not melt until at least mid-June. <a href="#n0944" id="ln0944" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As mid-June approached, the entire expedition busied itself preparing for the <span class="tei_name">Lolo</span> assault. By June 6, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> felt certain that their food stocks were sufficient to meet any challenge on the trail. But two days later, all those hopes and plans suffered an unexpected setback. A 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   reported that the trail beyond <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span> was still so deep with snow that any passage during June was courting disaster. As the Indian explained, "If we attempted it sooner our horses would be at least three days travel without food on the top of the mountain." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted, "This information is disagreeable inasmuch as it causes some doubt as to the time at which it will be proper for us to set out." A hurried and anguished meeting to discuss tactics must have followed that unwelcome 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   road report. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had held a similar talk in early June 1805 to decide whether the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> was the true <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> channel, they had made the right choice. But in a rush to get home, and increasingly fearful of delay, the captains now blundered into the wrong decision. "As we have no time to loose we will wrisk the chanches and set out as early as the Indians generally think practicable or the middle of this month." Risking the chances was dangerous enough; without Indian guides, the expedition was moving toward a rendezvous with the Lolo that not even the old <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> luck could overcome. <a href="#n0945" id="ln0945" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The decision to leave <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> against Indian advice and without guides was dead wrong, but it was very popular with the rank and file in the Corps of Discovery. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> insisted that "our party seem much elated with the idea of moving on towards their friends and Country, they all seem alirt in their movements today." But as the day of departure approached, both captains began to have second thoughts. "Even now," said <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, "I shudder with the expectation [of] great difficuelties in passing those Mountains." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was typically more explicit in his appraisal of the situation.
<blockquote><p>
	I am still apprehensive that the snow and the want of food for
	our horses will prove a serious imbarrassment to us as at
	least four days journey of our rout in these mountains lies
	over hights and along a ledge of mountains never intirely
	distititue of snow. Every body seems anxious to be in motion,
	convinced that we have not now any time to delay if the
	calculation is to reach the United States this season; this I
	am detirmined to accomplish if within the compass of human
	power. <a href="#n0946" id="ln0946" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
                  </p></blockquote>
That determination now brought <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to risk their chances on what all remembered as a harsh, unforgiving trail.</p>
               <p>
On June 15, the explorers rode from <span class="tei_name">Camp Chopunnish</span> to <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span>. Even that reasonably easy path proved hazardous as spring rains made the ground slippery. Fallen timber blocked much of the route and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was forced to concede that "our march [was] slow and extreemly laborious." On the following day, as the expedition moved to higher elevations, the full impact of snowy conditions on the trail became plain. Although the <span class="tei_name">Lolo</span> vanished in deep snow, the expedition was determined to press on. But even <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> began to question such foolhardy valor, and at the end of an exhausting day wrote that the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot</span> snow "augers but unfavorably with rispect to the practicability of passing the mountains." <a href="#n0947" id="ln0947" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a>

June 17 proved a day of decision and defeat. Floundering in drifts sometimes twelve to fifteen feet deep, each member of the party musth have recalled those terrible days of September 1805 when it seemed the <span class="tei_name">Lolo</span> would be a cold grave. With men near exhaustion and horses unable to breast the drifts, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> held another hurried conference. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> made the choices and chances painfully clear. "If we proceeded and should get bewildered in these mountains the certainty was that we should loose all our horses and consequently our baggage, instruments perhaps our papers and thus eminently wrisk the loss of the discoveries which we had already made if we should be so fortunate as to escape with life." The needed on the compass of human power had swung about and now counseled retreat. Bested by the bitter snows, the expedition "a good deel dejected" turned around and headed back toward <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span>, there to wait for Indian guides hired by <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>. <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span> caught the mood at the end of the day when he wrote that most in the party were "melancholy and disappointed." Camping that night in a chill rain that edged toward sleet, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> could only recall, "This is the first time since we have been on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or make a retrograde march." <a href="#n0948" id="ln0948" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
After the difficult and depressing trek back to <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span>, the expedition's fortunes took an upward turn. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> brought three 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   guides into camp. In return for guns and ammunition, these men promised to direct the explorers at least as far as <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were told that a peace had been arranged between 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Walula</span>, and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   bands. But news about fresh engagements with <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> warriors was troubling. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   guides claimed that hostile raiders had recently killed many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                  . Those deaths added both danger and urgency to <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> diplomacy on the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>. <a href="#n0949" id="ln0949" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Led by experienced 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , the expedition made a safe and swift passage over those tremendous mountains. By June 29 the explorers were at the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Hot Springs</span> enjoying the recuperative powers of steaming water on aching muscles and bruised feet. Once at <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span> on July 1, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> put the final touches on an intricate plan that promised to fulfill many of their objectives and test their field skills.</p>
               <p>
The captains "consurted" the following strategy. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> would take a small party overland to the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> "by the most direct route." Privates <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Goodrich</span>, and McNeal would remain at the falls to retrieve and refurbish equipment cached in 1805. In the meantime, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> would take a handful of volunteers up the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> to chart its northern course, explore the country, and contact the Blackfeet and Atsina Indians. After that dangerous reconnaissance, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> hoped to rejoin the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> detachment on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> for a grand reunion with <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>.</p>
               <p>
Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> Blackfeet adventure on the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span> was more dramatic than anything <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> undertook, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> assignment was every bit as important. He was to proceed south from <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span> through the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Valley</span> and eventually cross the <span class="tei_name">Great Divide</span> to <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>. At the forks, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> planned to take his party overland to find the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> and explore its course to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. At the same time, a group under <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> would travel by canoe from <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> to <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> for a linkup with the men left by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Eventually the whole Corps of Discovery would reassemble at the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>-<span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> confluence. <a href="#n0950" id="ln0950" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
One last detail remained to be done that day at <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span>. Thinking about the complex diplomacy ahead with <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided that the Nor'Wester <span class="tei_name">Hugh Heney</span> might prove a valuable ally in the struggle either to win or to cow the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . In a long letter to <span class="tei_name">Heney</span>, the explorers offered him the office of Indian agent. More specifically, the captains wanted the trader to use his influence to wean 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   chiefs away from British merchants like Murdoch Cameron and bring them into the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade system. At the same time, they hoped <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> could organize a delegation of chiefs and elders for a journey to <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. Reflecting <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> ideas on American trade along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the letter urged <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> to employ every means to pacify or at least neutralize <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> power. So long as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   choked traffic from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, the American fur trade would slowly die. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> explained to <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> that American Indian policy was based on peace and reconciliation. But the iron fist of coercion was undisguised in the letter. If the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   did not allow passage of American trade goods, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were "positive that she [the United States] will not long suffer her citizens to be deprived of the free navigation of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> by a fiew comparatively feeble bands of Savages who be so illy advised as to refuse her profered friendship and continue their depridation on her citizens who may in future assend or decend the river." The captains' claims that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors amounted to "comparatively feeble bands of Savages" would have surprised men like <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> who had effectively derailed American policy two years before. The letter suggests that when it came to understanding plains Indian politics, the explorers had still not learned the lessons of the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> confrontation. <a href="#n0951" id="ln0951" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a>

               <p>
One day after leaving <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his party were reminded of the dangers that lay ahead. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew that entering <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> and <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> territories was risky, but when his 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   guides left him and warned that the "Pahkees" would "cut us off," the full weight of that danger came home. Two days later, when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men were at the <span class="tei_name">Big Blackfoot River</span>, they saw so many abandoned lodges as to become "much on our guard both day and night." <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> concern was justified, but by the time his detachment reached the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri</span> on July 15, they still had seen no Indians. Once at the falls, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> selected <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span> and <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> to take part in what was to be the most violent Indian encounter in expedition history. <a href="#n0952" id="ln0952" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Leaving <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> on July 17, the explorers rode northwest, believing this route would bring them to the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> or <span class="tei_name">Rose River</span> and then on to the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>. On <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> shortgrass plains as flat as "a well shaved bowling green," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men maintained a "strict lookout" for any Indians. By July 21 a disappointed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> realized that the course of the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span> was not as northward as he had hoped. That unhappy discovery was overshadowed on the following days as the explorers found more signs that Indians were nearby. When the ever-watchful <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> located a cluster of eleven recently abandoned skin lodges, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> assumed that these were made by <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> buffalo hunters camped along the main branch of the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>. At <span class="tei_name">Camp Disappointment</span> on July 25, there were even more traces of recent native presence. As he had once before, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote that he was "extreemly fortunate in not having met with these people." <a href="#n0953" id="ln0953" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The captain's good fortune ran out the next day, July 27. Leaving <span class="tei_name">Camp Disappointment</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> rode with the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> while <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> scouted the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span> valley. At midafternoon, as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> forded <span class="tei_name">Badger Creek</span> and came up a sharp rise, he spotted to his far left some thirty horses, about half having saddles. The captain quickly drew out his small telescope for a closer look. He saw "a very unpleasant sight." Standing out against the afternoon sky were several Indians looking intently down toward the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span> valley and its cottonwood fringe. These Indians were so fixed on watching <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> that they did not appear to notice <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his companions. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> immediately decided to make the best of an uncertain situation and proceeded to "approach them in a friendly way." <a href="#n0954" id="ln0954" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
To signal their intention, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span> riding on ahead with an American flag. At that moment, the Indians saw the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> forces and became frightened. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> later explained, they "appeared to run about in a very confused manner as if much allarmed." Plainly fearing an attack, several Indians came down toward the horses and drove them back up to the summit. If the Indians were fearful of hostilities, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was equally concerned. He believed that there might be at least as many warriors as there were horses—surely a daunting thought. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was also convinced that any attempt to escape from such a large, well-armed war party would invite disaster. Riding on, the Americans came to within a quarter of a mile of the warriors before the Indians made any move toward them.</p>
               <p>
Some hint of what was going on in the minds of the <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> warriors comes from an interview conducted in the early 1900s by the ethnologist George Bird Grinnell with an elderly <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> named Wolf Calf. Wolf Calf was the youngest member of the war party, and his recollections of that meeting with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> were still vivid and remarkably accurate. The Indian admitted that his companions were both surprised and frightened when they saw <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> men but decided to act in "a friendly fashion" for at least a short time. That decision was made plain when one Indian galloped toward <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> at full tilt. Seeing this and understanding it was not a general charge, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> dismounted and extended his hand to the <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span>. The warrior eyed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and then cantered his horse back to the main <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> group. Whatever this scout said to his fellows was not recorded by Wolf Calf, but the fact that all eight soon came riding to meet the Americans perhaps suggests that the Indians were now confident of their own security.</p>
               <p>
As the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> neared <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span>, the captain remained certain that additional warriors were still hiding close at hand. Claiming an expertise that was not really his, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> told <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span> that these Indians were <span class="tei_name">"Minnetarees of Fort de Prairie" or Atsinas</span>. Using language filled with more swagger than wisdom, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> pronounced his willingness to "resist to the last extremity prefering death to that of being deprived of my papers instruments and gun." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, once again on his horse, advanced slowly and met the one Indian who was ahead of the rest. Both men cautiously shook hands and then moved on to use the same welcome with those behind. This accomplished, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> dismounted. Perhaps thinking this signaled the beginning of a parley, the Indians asked for pipes and tobacco. Those supplies were with <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> who was still down along the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span>. While one Indian joined <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span> to find <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> tried his hand at some sign language. Inquiring as to what tribe these men belonged, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> understood their answer to be that they were <span class="tei_name">Atsinas</span>. Although unquestionably they were <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>, there are two possible explanations for <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> faulty identification. Because the expedition's most skilled sign language interpreter was still down in the river valley, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> may have simply misunderstood what was being signed. It is equally possible that the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>, already thinking about stealing guns and horses, hoped to shift the blame on other Indians. Whatever the case, <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> attempt at conversation as well as his handing out of medals, flags, and handkerchiefs did little to calm the edgy <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>. They seemed "more allarmed at this accedental interview than we were." Still worried about more warriors, and with evening approaching, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> suggested leaving high ground for a camp nearer the river. Guiding their horses down steep bluffs made more dangerous by loose, slippery gravel, the explorers and their nervous <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> hosts made their way to three solitary cottonwood trees near the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span>.</p>
               <p>
At those trees which still stand near the river, the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> put up a makeshift shelter of buffalo skins. Then the Indians invited <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party to join them. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was anxious to learn as much as possible from the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>. Using <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> signs, he conducted "much conversation" inside the hide wickiup that night. The <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> said that they were part of a large band camped along the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> must have perked up when he heard that this band had a white trader in camp. He may well have urged <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> to press the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> for more details about <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>-Canadian trade. What <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> learned simply reenforced <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> worst fears. Agents of the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company were firmly entrenched on the northern plains and were rapidly extending their influence throughout the region. The <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> made regular visits to posts like <span class="tei_name">Buckingham House</span> and <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountain House</span> along the <span class="tei_name">North Saskatchewan River</span>. Those Indians brought to the "Northern White Men" wolf and beaver pelts for guns, ammunition, and alcohol. Their loyalty to the Canadians made it clear that American fur traders would find this part of the northern plains a hard market to crack. <a href="#n0955" id="ln0955" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> heard form the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> worried him, what he said frightened them. Explaining that he came from the east and had been beyond the mountains to the great ocean, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> unwittingly dropped a geo-political bombshell by declaring that the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet's</span> traditional enemies—the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Kutenais</span>—were now united by an American-inspired peace. Even more shocking to <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> ears was word that these united tribes would be getting guns and supplies from Yankee traders. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> thought the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> would receive such news with glad hearts and then join an American alliance, he gravely misjudged western realities. That night along the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> the explorer, in effect, announced the clash of empires had come to the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>. After more than twenty years of unchallenged power on the plains made possible by Canadian guns, the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> now faced a profound threat to their power and survival. Unaware that this was a frontal assault on <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> influence, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> invited the warriors to help form a delegation of chiefs and elders for additional talks in <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. To make that offer more attractive, he promised ten horses and much tobacco to those who ventured east to see the great chief of the seventeen fires. But all this naive talk did not hide the fact that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men were among well-armed <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> whose intentions were unclear. Had the captain known what young Wolf Calf knew that night—that a decision had been made to steal the expedition's guns—the explorer might have doubled the watch. <a href="#n0956" id="ln0956" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In the chill dawn hours of July 27, <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span> struggled to fight back sleep and keep his watch. As soon as it was light, the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> were up and crowding around the fire. Intent on watching them, <span class="tei_name">Field</span> carelessly laid his gun behind him and close to his sleeping brother <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span>. One of the Indians, seeing the gun unguarded, slipped behind <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> and quietly took the weapon. That act was a signal for other Indians to take guns belonging to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>. Still unnoticed, the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> then attempted to make good their escape with valuable booty. It was only then that <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span> saw what was happening and shouted to rouse his sleeping brother. <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span>, armed only with a broad-blade knife, gave angry chase. He proved a faster runner than a <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> named <span class="tei_name">Side Hill Calf</span>. <span class="tei_name">Field</span> caught the Indian, pulled the guns away, and in a moment of fury thrust his knife into the man's chest. When an excited <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span> told <span class="tei_name">John Ordway</span> late the next day about the deed, he said that <span class="tei_name">Side Hill Calf</span> "drew but one breath [and] the wind of his breath followed the knife and he fell dead."</p>
               <p>
But <span class="tei_name">Side Hill Calf's</span> violent end was only the beginning of confusion and bloodletting around the lonely cottonwoods. Awakened by all the shouting, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> saw an Indian making off with his rifle and shot pouch. Springing up, the Frenchman yelled, "Damn you let go my gun," and wrested it from the <span class="tei_name">Piegan's</span> hands. That shout awakened <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, who by his own admission had been in "a profound sleep." Still groggy, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> demanded to know what was going on. What he saw was explanation enough as <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> scuffled with the Indian. Going to aid the interpreter, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> reached for his rifle only to find it missing. He then drew his horse pistol and began to run after one of the fleeing <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>. Quickly overtaking him, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> leveled his pistol at the Indian and demanded return of the rifle. The hapless thief was about to do as ordered when the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span>, still boiling with anger, came up and asked permission to shoot the Indian. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wisely refused a similar request from <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, who had now captured the would-be robber of his weapon.</p>
               <p>
It now appeared that the <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> plan had been thwarted and the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> might quietly retire. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> believed that, he was soon jolted back to a harsher reality. Once the Indians saw that the Americans had all their guns back, the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> turned their attention to the expedition's horses. Losing guns was serious enough, but without horses <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men would be stranded in a difficult country. For the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>, it seemed a last chance to rescue some honor and bring home valuable prizes. Now they threatened the survival of the American detachment and the ultimate success of the whole western venture. Understanding the stakes, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered his men to open fire on any Indians trying to make off with horses. Whie the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> pursued some <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ran after two <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> doing just that. Nearly out of breath from the long dash, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> called on the Indians to release the stolen horses or he would fire. One Indian hid behind some mushroom-shaped rocks and called to his friend, standing about thirty paces from <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. That armed Indian suddenly turned around and squarely faced <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Certain he was about to be attacked, the captain shot his adversary through the stomach. Stunned by what was plainly a mortal wound, the warrior fell to his knees. Then suddenly he raised himself up on one elbow and fired a desperate shot at <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. But from his awkward position the dying man could not take clean aim and the ball went whistling just over the captain's head. "Being bearheaded," recalled <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "I felt the wind of his bullet very distinctly."</p>
               <p>
As quickly as the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> fight had exploded in two deaths, it was over. Whatever the combatants on both sides felt about each other, all were united by a common desire—to escape as quickly as possible. Fleeing north, the six surviving <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> must have feared that more armed whites were on the way. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was equally fearful of <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> revenge. He ordered the horses rounded up and decided to use the stronger Indian ones to make good a speedy escape. While <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span> prepared the horses, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> gathered up shields, bows, and arrows abandoned by the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span>. He burned the weapons and in a final act of defiance put a peace medal around <span class="tei_name">Side Hill Calf's</span> neck so that "they might be informed who we were." As if to count coup on the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> cut off the amulets from the shields and took them along as spoils of war. <a href="#n0957" id="ln0957" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
What remained now was to escape the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> killing ground. Ahead lay two full days of hard riding over broken ground to reach <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> party on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men finally reached the great river on the afternoon of July 28, they had "the unspeakable satisfaction to see our canoes coming down." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his tired companions left behind at the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> the seed of a myth that has long shaped popular understanding of the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> fight. That myth links the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> encounter with later <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>-American hostilities. As the story goes, the violence directed against American fur traders in the years after <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was the result of <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span> revenge wreaked on the killers of <span class="tei_name">Side Hill Calf</span> and his unnamed fellow warrior. The death of <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> at <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> in 1810 at the hands of a <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> war party has been used to strengthen the claim for an undying Indian vengeance.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span> myth was not the product of anything either the explorers or their contemporaries wrote about the fight or about later trapper troubles. Rather, the tale appears to have its genesis in the fertile imagination of Washington Irving. In his <span class="italic">Astoria,</span> Irving claimed that the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> had "conceived an implacable hostility to the white men, in consequence of one of their warriors having been killed by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>, while attempting to steal horses." When David H. Coyner published his <span class="italic">The Lost Trappers</span> in 1847, he repeated Irving's claim and added, "The act created an implacable hatred for the whites from that day till this." By the time Elliott Coues produced his edition of <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle's</span>
                  <span class="italic">History</span> in 1893, the legend was in full bloom. Coues gave his stamp of approval to the tale in a footnote citing the Irving account and stories he heard on the northern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> frontier in 1874. Although historians from Hiram Chittenden to more recent scholars have discredited this interpretation of native behavior and have suggested more persuasive explanations, the myth continues to be repeated in popular accounts of the expedition as well as in an occasional serious study. <a href="#n0958" id="ln0958" class="ref_link"><sup>[58]</sup></a>

As Alvin Josephy, Jr., pointed out in 1965, the key to understanding <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> actions toward American traders comes from something <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> himself said that July night around the fire along the <span class="tei_name">Two Medicine</span>. After telling the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> that their traditional enemies had been united in a peace promoted by American diplomats, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> dropped the other shoe. Traders from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> were going to sell guns to those united tribes, thus challenging the place of the <span class="tei_name">Piegan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Blood</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Siksika</span> peoples. All of that seemed to come terribly true in subsequent years. By 1807–1808, men working for <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> entrepreneurs were busy trading with <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> rivals. When a former member of the expedition, <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span>, joined in an 1808 battle with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   warriors against the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, the message was not lost on anyone. It may well have been that those merchants in places like <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountain House</span> saw to it that the import of that message was fully understood. In the face of a massive assault on their plains empire, <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> warriors hardly had time to think of avenging Side Hill Calf and his unfortunate companion. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was unwittingly the prophet of events like the 1821 Immell-Jones massacre; he was not their cause. The bloody fray on the morning of July 27 provides a window into the ever-unstable balance of plains power. Although <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> revenge against Americans for the deeds of Reuben Field and <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> may satisfy the modern writer's sense of historical symmetry, it was the more potent forces of guns and international trade that made the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> feared by a generation of American mountain men. <a href="#n0959" id="ln0959" class="ref_link"><sup>[59]</sup></a>

It was not until noon on August 12, 1806, that the Corps of Discovery reassembled. Much had happened since those days at <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party had explored the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>, the plan for <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> to carry a letter to <span class="tei_name">Hugh Heney</span> had misfired when 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                   Indians stole expedition horses, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had been wounded in a freak hunting accident. But now on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> below the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>, the company was whole again. What remained of its Indian business was the same thorny problem that had occupied so much time during the winter with the Mandans. Establishing peace among <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villagers and the consequences of that peace were at the heart of that problem. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had not abandoned their commitment to a villager alliance aimed at eliminating or reducing 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   influence. The explorers thought they had successfully planted the seeds of that policy during their first winter. In truth, the alliance and the tactics to execute it were no more realistic in 1806 than they had been in 1804. But realism had never been part of the expedition's Indian policy. As the explorer-diplomats began their final talks with the Indians, there was no reason to think that they might suddenly understand the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> facts of life. <a href="#n0960" id="ln0960" class="ref_link"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
For three days beginning on August 14, <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> carried on constant and sometimes difficult negotiations with <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> leaders. Neither cast nor lines had changed much since the explorers and the Indians had met during the winter of 1804–1805. The issues—trade, sovereignty, and the villager alliance—were the same. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, <span class="tei_name">Black Moccasin</span>, <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> were familiar faces from the earlier scene. Believing that the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> was the key to American success, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> quickly sought him out after paying brief calls at the villages of <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> greeted <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with customary warmth, and together the two men shared a summer squash and smoked a friendly pipe.</p>
               <p>
Anxious to begin talks on the delegation issue as soon as possible, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> detailed <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> to call on <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs while <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was sent to <span class="tei_name">Sheheke's</span> village to hire <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span> as council interpreter. When <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> arrived at the expedition's camp just above <span class="tei_name">Matootonha</span> village, the talks began. Following a familiar agenda, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first renewed the invitation to visit <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> and speak with the president. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> agreed with such a journey would be important but insisted that the price in danger exacted by <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors was too high. It was just those kinds of fears that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sought to allay. Claiming more power than either the expedition or the United States actually had, he told <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> that the Americans "would not suffer those Indians [the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  ] to hurt any of our red children who should think proper to accompany us." Bent on making promises even more difficult to keep, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> offered continued federal military protection against hostile raiders after the chiefs returned home. To make American proposals more palatable, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reminded <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> that there would be lavish gifts for all who ventured so far from home.</p>
               <p>
This exchange was interrupted by the arrival of <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span>. If there was one man the explorers had failed to impress during the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter, it was this powerful and astute <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief. That <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> now came without much coaxing illustrated his recognition that some accommodation might be necessary with the persistent strangers from downriver. Knowing how important this moment was, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> rounded up whatever other chiefs he could find and assembled them along the riverbank. With <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> as interpreter, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> once again repeated the familiar litany of American proposals. Delegations could see for themselves the wealth and power of the American nation. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> encouraged quick action on the invitation, hinting that a prompt decision would hasten the arrival of quality trade goods at reasonable prices.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne's</span> reply was characterized by the kind of political acumen that marked so much of his diplomacy with both Indians and whites. He showed some passing interest in making the long trip to <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> but insisted that dangers posed by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   made the journey far too harzardous. "The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were in the road," he said, "and would most certainly kill him or any others who should go down." Suddenly turning the negotiating tables, the chief observed that the American claim to have brought peace to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> was not true. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors had recently killed eight <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> and taken some horses. And there had been renewed tension with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were peacemakers of dubious repute, <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> boasted that he had done much better. The chief had recently negotiated a complex trade agreement with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  . When the Americans pacified the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , then <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> might consider a visit to the federal father. <a href="#n0961" id="ln0961" class="ref_link"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have finally realized that <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> was not a likely prospect for conversion to client-chief status. But there was always <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>. When he asked <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to make a second visit to <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>, the captain may have taken new hope that the delegation problem was nearing some solution. As the two men again shared a pipe, <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> broke the news <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> most feared. Because "the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were still very troublesom," not a single prominent man was willing to risk a <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> voyage. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> tried to soften the blow by offering twelve bushels of corn from what had been a slim harvest. But that well-meaning gesture could not hide a serious failure of the expedition. Plainly disappointed, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> urged the chief and his elders to "pitch on some man which they could rely and send him to see their great father." After more objections were aired, one young man stepped forward and agreed to go. But when <span class="tei_name">George Gibson</span> reported that the man had taken his knife, all fury broke loose. For all the comic overtones in a process that seemed to move two steps back for every one forward, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was justifiable angry. Tongue-lashed by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the chief and elders hung their heads. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> broke the painful silence and admitted that fear of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   ambushes and reprisal made it impossible for anyone to accompany the expedition. At last <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> seemed to grasp the depth of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> concern. To his credit, he gracefully accepted the inevitable and quietly spent more time smoking with <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>.</p>
               <p>
Later the same day, August 15, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> brought some startling news. The Frenchman claimed that <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>, second chief at <span class="tei_name">Matootonha</span>, had expressed a desire to go with the expedition. After so many false starts and setbacks, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was determined not to let this opportunity slip away. Taking <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> with him, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hurried to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village for a talk with <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>. The chief acknowledged his interest in the journey but wanted to talk with friends and family before setting out on so dangerous a course. A pipe of tobacco moved that intention along and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned to his camp thinking the delegation issue settled at last.</p>
               <p>
What <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> heard late that night made the need for any diplomatic success even more urgent. Since returning to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> had spent some time at <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span>, where he and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> had lived before joining the expedition. From those contacts he had learned that several <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war parties had gone out against <span class="tei_name">Camehwait's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Such news plainly demonstrated the fragile character of any villager alliance. Even more worrisome, continued <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> forays against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and other potential American allies could only subvert and discredit diplomatic efforts made over the past two years. A symbolic gesture in the form of a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> delegation could not change old patterns of warfare, but it might rescue the expedition's diplomatic reputation. <a href="#n0962" id="ln0962" class="ref_link"><sup>[62]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On August 16, compelled by a sense of desperation, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made one last effort to fashion a respectable delegation. When <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> and several other <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs appeared uninvited at the American camp, he was given a rare opportunity. Here was a final chance to impress <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> and perhaps bring him into the federal fold. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have even dared to hope that at least one <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> might join <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span> to form a genuinely representative delegation. Pulling out all the ceremonial stops, the captains decided to give <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> one of the swivel guns that had originally been on the keelboat. As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had the cannon loaded, he offered a double-barreled message. Raids against the "pore defenceless <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span>" had to stop, and such a potent weapon could always be used to defend American friends.</p>
               <p>
Although <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> was plainly pleased with the gift, it was the elderly chief <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span> who now replied to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> orator, who had so effectively challenged the expedition's diplomacy two years before, now repeated what must have been painfully familiar to all the explorers. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> wanted to see the great father, but so long as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   stood in the way such a trip was impossible. But <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span> had more to say and more than <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted to hear. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief had been opposed to an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace and lessening of tensions with the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   in 1804, and nothing he had heard since had changed his mind. Raids against enemies were both strategically wise and culturally necessary. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> were not about to alter old ways and endanger village security simply to please the seemingly odd whims of unpredictable strangers. There would be no <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> representatives, nor would there be any promises of peace and cooperation. <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> proudly took the cannon back to his village, but as was so often the case, the American diplomats were left with empty hands and empty promises.</p>
               <p>
For all the disappointment with the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> felt certain that he still had <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span> as a token delegate. Later on the evening of August 16, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> walked to <span class="tei_name">Matootonha</span> to keep up the chief's resolve. To his astonishment, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was bluntly told that <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span> had changed his mind and would not accompany the expedition downriver. Not even a gift of a flag could change the Indian's mind. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> pressed <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> to find reasons for this unwelcome change of heart, the interpreter reported that there had been a serious argument between <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> was evidently jealous of the prestige offered to <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>. At this point a frustrated <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> simply did not care who the delegate was so long as he was of sufficient rank and influence. Turning again to <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> asked him to use his influence to enlist <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> in the expedition's ranks. The trader, a man always in search of the main chance, drove a hard bargain. He promised to deliver <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> if the Americans agreed to provide transportation and rations for the <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> families. Worn down by days of fruitless talk and seeing no alternatives, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> grudgingly agreed. <a href="#n0963" id="ln0963" class="ref_link"><sup>[63]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Saturday, August 17, was a day to tie up loose ends. There were brief but inconclusive talks with some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs, financial settlements with <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and a fur trade-bound <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span>, and some poignant words from <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> about the future of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> young <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</span>, "a butifull promising child." By midmorning the expedition was at <span class="tei_name">Matootonha</span> to pick up the <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> entourages. The explorers were already anticipating the joys of a festive homecoming, but when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came to <span class="tei_name">Sheheke's</span> lodge he saw what it meant for the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief to leave for an uncertain future. Grim-faced elders sat smoking farewell pipes while women wept. Despite <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> efforts to reassure the villagers with gifts of powder and bullets, "maney of them cried out aloud" as <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and his family went to the canoes. Tears and gunpowder were not the sort of legacy <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted to leave behind. <a href="#n0964" id="ln0964" class="ref_link"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Only one piece of Indian diplomacy was left before reaching <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. The role of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> in Middle <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> trade and politics had always eluded <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The explorers simply could not comprehend the intricate relationship between <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farmers and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   hunters. In the eyes of the explorers, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> should have been willing recruits in the struggle against <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> power. That 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and Arikara warriors continued to carry out joint raids against <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns was bewildering. How could the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> pursue a policy that further bound them to their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   oppressors? <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped that the earlier delegation sent under <span class="tei_name">Joseph Gravelines</span>, and now the presence of <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, might at last end the raids that fueled endless hostilities.</p>
               <p>
By the morning of August 21, the expedition was at the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> and the Arikara villages. After exchanging volleys of shots in greeting, the Americans landed opposite the upper village of <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span>. While securing their canoes, the explorers could not miss the white skin lodges that dotted the hillsides above the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns. Those tepees belonged to 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   who regularly traded for <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had met individual 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   during the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> winter, but now there was a chance for serious talks with these important plains people. Once on shore, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was greeted by a crowd of friendly and inquisitive <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  .</p>
               <p>
Without further ceremony, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided to hold a council. Putting <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> to his left, he faced a semicircle of eager Indians. To symbolize the hoped-for peace between villages, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> offered <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> tobacco for all to smoke. Encouraged by the acceptance of that gift, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> launched into a capsule history of the expedition, relating "where we had been, what we had done and said to the different nations." He was aided in that narrative by the presence of the trader and translator <span class="tei_name">Joseph Garreau</span>. As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> surveyed the assembled dignitaries, he may have noticed a man of substantial importance who had not been seen in October 1804. That man was <span class="tei_name">Grey Eyes</span>, who had taken the place of <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> as principal chief and would lead defiance against American forces in 1823. After being introduced to <span class="tei_name">Grey Eyes</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> again emphasized the need for peace with neighbors and unity against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . The <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief than delivered a "very animated" speech, filled with rhetorical sound and fury denouncing the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   as "bad people." But the sharp words were intended to please <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and did not signify any change in <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> policy. <span class="tei_name">Grey Eyes</span> certainly wished that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   might be less troublesome at market times, but he was not about to alienate so strong and important a customer in order to please untested whites.</p>
               <p>
As the day grew hotter and the diplomacy less successful, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was grateful when a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   chief invited him to enjoy the shade of a tepee. Making little progress with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, the captain hoped for better with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  . After smoking with the chief, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> offered him a small peace medal. It was an awkward moment when the frightened chief firmly rejected the gift. "He knew that the white people were all medecine," explained <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, "and was afraid of the medal or anything that white people gave them." It was only with the greatest difficulty that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> convinced the chief that flags and medals were signs of status and prestige, not carriers of disease and death. As things fell out, American diplomacy proved more successful with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   than the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Just before leaving the villages on August 22, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was approached by several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   chiefs who asked that American traders be sent among them to teach proper trapping techniques. That was the kind of request to gladden the heart of any <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchant. <a href="#n0965" id="ln0965" class="ref_link"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   requests were still in the future as <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, who had accompanied <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   camp, offered a long discourse on villager tensions—a diatribe that contained more self-justification than serius analysis. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan's</span> torrent of invective was finally checked when the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   chief caustically observed that all the village folk shared a measure of blame. Never one to miss a chance to press the fundamentals of American Indian policy, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> again insisted that "if they wished to be happy they must shake off all intimecy with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and unite themselves in a strong alliance and attend to what he had told them." But, as before, American proposals got no more than token assent.</p>
               <p>
Unnoticed throughout the day was the growing tension caused by the presence of <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and his family. They were constant reminders of all the blows and strikes the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   had exchanged over the years. Resentment finally exploded late in the evening. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> found himself embroiled in an acrimonious shouting match with an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief named <span class="tei_name">One Arm</span>. Fearful that <span class="tei_name">One Arm's</span> "loud and thretening tone" might lead to violence, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> stepped in and reminded the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> that <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> was under American protection. Any harm done to him would bring a strong response from the expedition. That threat evidently worked since <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finished the evening hearing <span class="tei_name">One Arm</span> and the other chiefs swear peace toward the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and loyalty to the United States. <a href="#n0966" id="ln0966" class="ref_link"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But their solemn oaths meant little. The next morning, as the expedition prepared to make the final pull for <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Garreau</span> reported that the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs had decided not to form another delegation until the first party had safely returned. And the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> leaders themselves again told <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> how dependent they were on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   for guns and ammunition. Those were facts that not even the most adept diplomat could shape to fit an American mold. Except for the interest in the fur trade shown by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , the expedition left the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> with little to call success. <a href="#n0967" id="ln0967" class="ref_link"><sup>[67]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The next month saw <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sprint for home. Moving quickly with the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> current, the expedition often covered fifty or sixty miles in a day. Despite unending mosquito attacks, sudden rain squalls, and sore eyes from river glare, the men "ply'd their orers very well." But <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the Brulé <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  Sioux, those most redoubtable of expedition adversaries, were not about to allow <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to leave the river without one last set-to. At the end of August, as the Americans neared present-day <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, they spotted <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and a large band of well-armed men along the river bank. What ensued was a nasty verbal exchange that pitted <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> against <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>. The jeering and hooting so unnerved the explorers that when they came upon some friendly <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  Sioux two days later there was nearly fatal gunfire.</p>
               <p>
But raw nerves were soothed in the days that followed. Edginess was replaced by excitement. Every day brought fresh signs that the great venture—what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had once called "a darling project of mine"—was nearly done. New clothes, tobacco, and alcohol obtained from trader <span class="tei_name">James Aird</span> brought the men of the expedition one step closer to home and further from the life they had shared for so long. And then in the third week of September there were the familiar sights and faces of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and what had been the Corps of Discovery was about to escape into national history and myth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
The final scene in a drama that had so long bound together the lives of Indians and explorers was played out on September 23 at <span class="tei_name">Fort Bellefontaine</span> along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> above <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. Sentries on duty that cold, wet morning were perhaps the only audience as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> escorted <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> to the "publick store" so that the Mandan chief could outfit himself and his family in the latest fashion. <a href="#n0968" id="ln0968" class="ref_link"><sup>[68]</sup></a> As the Indian searched through stacks of calico shirts, fancy handkerchiefs, and colored beads, he symbolized the first fruits of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition. The explorers brought Indian America face to face with the Industrial Revolution and a rising American empire. Still ahead for people from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> were more delegations, more talks, and more troubles. The calloused hands of the explorers had delivered the Indians into the finer fingers of agents, merchants, and bureaucrats. But, for now, none of that was clear to grizzled veterans or to an anxious Indians. For <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, there was only the homecoming reserved to those once feared lost and now found. Men of the expedition were about to reenter a familiar world; <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and his kin could not say the same. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief, dressed in the best the young Republic could afford, did not know how much those explorers had forever changed his world.
