We had now nothing to do but wait for the canoes; as they had not returned I sent out some of the small party with me to hunt; in the evening they returned with a good quantity of the flesh of a fat buffaloe which they had killed.    the canoes not arrived this evening. I saw several very large grey Eagles today they are a half as large again as the common bald Eagle of this country. I do not think the bald Eagle here qute so large as those of the U' States; the grey Eagle is infinitely larger and is no doubt a distinct species. <a href="#n16071101" id="ln16071101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    this evening a little before the sun set I heared two other discharges of this unaccounable artillery of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> proceeding from the same quarter that I had before heard it. I now recollected the <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Minnetares</a> making mention of the nois which they had frequently heard in the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> like thunder; and which they said the mountains made; but I paid no attention to the information supposing it either false or the fantom of a supersticious immagination. I have also been informed by the engages that the <a class="regularization" title="Pawnee Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Pawnee%20Indians">Panis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Ricaras</a> give the same account of the <a class="regularization" title="Black Hills" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Black%20Hills">Black mountains</a> which lye West of them.    this phenomenon the philosophy of the engages readily accounts for; they state it to be the bursting of the rich mines of silver which these mounains contain.</p>

were in good order; his hunters had also killed two deer and an Antelope yesterday.    the three other canoes did not arrive untill late in the evening in consequence of the wind and the fear of weting their loads which consisted of articles much more liable to be injured by moisture than those which composed the load of that which arrived in the morning. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
