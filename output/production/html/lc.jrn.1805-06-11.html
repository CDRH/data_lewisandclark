This morning I felt much better, but somewhat w[e]akened by my disorder.    at 8 A. M. I swung my pack, and set forward with my little party.    proceeded to the point where Rose [<span class="italic">NB: Tansey</span>] River a branch Maria's River approaches the Missouri so nearly. <a href="#n15061101" id="ln15061101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    from this hight we discovered a herd of Elk on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> just above us to which we desended and soon killed four of them.    we butchered them and hung up the meat and skins in view of the river in order that the party might get them. I determined to take dinner here, but before the meal was prepared I was taken with such violent pain in the intestens that I was unable to partake of the feast of marrowbones.    my pain still increased and towards evening was attended with a high fever; finding myself unable to march, I determined to prepare a camp of some willow boughs and remain all night.    having brought no medecine with me I resolved to try an experiment with some simples; and the Choke cherry which grew abundanly in the bottom first struck my attention; I directed a parsel of the small twigs to be geathered striped of their leaves, cut into pieces of about 2 Inches in length and boiled in water untill a strong black decoction of an astringent bitter tast was produced; <a href="#n15061102" id="ln15061102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> at sunset I took a point [pint] of this decoction and abut an hour after repeated the dze    by 10 in the evening I was entirely releived from pain and in fact every symptom of the disorder forsook me; my fever abated, a gentle perspiration was produced and I had a comfortable and refreshing nights rest. <a class="regularization" title="Goodrich, Silas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Goodrich%2C%20Silas">Goodrich</a> who is remarkably fond of fishing caught several douzen fish of two different species—    one about 9 inches long of white colour round and in form and fins resembles the white chub common to the Potomac; <a href="#n15061103" id="ln15061103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> this fish has a smaller head than the Chubb and the mouth is beset both above and below with a rim of fine sharp teeth; the eye moderately large, the puple dark and the iris which is narrow is of a yellowish brown colour, they bite at meat or grasshoppers.    this is a soft fish, not very good, tho' the flesh is of a fine white colour.    the other species is precisely the form and about the size of the well known fish called the
