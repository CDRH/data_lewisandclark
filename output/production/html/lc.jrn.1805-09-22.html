Notwithstanding my positive directions to hubble the horses last evening one of the men neglected to comply.    he plead ignorance of the order.    this neglect however detained us untill ½ after eleven OCk at which time we renewed our march, our course being about west.    we had proceeded about two and a half miles when we met <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">Reubin Fields</a> one of oure hunters, <a href="#n22092202" id="ln22092202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> whom <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> had dispatched to meet us with some dryed fish and roots that he had procured from a band of Indians, whose lodges were about eight miles in advance. I ordered the party to halt for the purpose of taking some refreshment. I divided the fish roots and buries, and was happy to find a sufficiency to satisfy compleatly all our appetites. <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">Fields</a> also killed a crow <a href="#n22092203" id="ln22092203" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    after refreshing ourselves we proceeded to the village <a href="#n22092204" id="ln22092204" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> due West 7½ Miles where we arrived at 5 OCk. in the afternoon    our rout was through lands heavily timbered, the larger wood entirely pine.    the country except the last 3 miles was broken and decending    the pleasure I now felt in having tryumphed over the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky Mountains</a> and decending once more to a level and fertile country where there was every rational hope of finding a comfortable subsistence for myself and party can be more readily conceived than expressed, nor was the flattering prospect of the final success of the expedition less pleasuing.    on our approach to the village which consisted of eighteen lodges most of the women fled to the neighbouring woods on horseback with their children, a circumstance I did not expect as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

Sunday Septemr 22nd    This morning clear &amp; pleasant, with a small white frost.    We were detained by the party, that went out to hunt our horses till about 9 o'Clock A.

among the party.    We delayed about an hour &amp; a half, and then proceeded on our Journey.    the two Men that had went back for to hunt for the Horse that had strayed from us the 20th instant; overtook us; they had found the
