                  <em class="hi">Friday 22nd.</em>    There was a cloudy wet morning, after a night of hard rain, and we stayed at this village to 12 o'clock. The natives used us friendly, and with kindness; gave us corn and beans, with other articles; but one of them would go down with us. At noon we got under way; and having proceeded twelve miles the weather became clear, and we halted to dry our baggage, which we got very wet last night. At four o'clock we again went on, and had a fine passage till night when we encamped.
