                  <em class="hi">Wednesday 9th.</em>    A cloudy morning. We set out early to go down the river; but had not proceeded far before it began to rain, and we halted at some old Indian lodges, where we took shelter. In an hours time the rain slackened, and we proceeded on; but had not gone far before it began to rain again, and the weather was very cold for the season. At noon we came up with our hunters, who had killed a large buffaloe; so we halted, and some of us went and dressed it, and brought in the best of the meat which was very good. We encamped <a href="#n37070909" id="ln37070909" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> here and lay by during the afternoon as the rain continued during the whole of it.
