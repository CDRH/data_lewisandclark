                  <em class="hi">Tuesday 3rd.</em>    This was a cloudy morning with a few drops of rain; and there were some light showers during the forenoon at intervals. The river rises in the night, and falls in the day time; which is occasioned by the snow melting by the heat of the sun on the mountains, which are too distant for the snow water to reach this place until after night. In the evening three hunters came in with the meat of five deer and a small bear. Several of the natives continued at our camp.
