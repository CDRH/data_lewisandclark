book is missing its original covers, is about 7½ by 4⅛ inches in size, with 120 unnumbered pages covering the period May 16 to September 23, 1806. The outer, first page of the notebook is quite faded and some words are illegible. This page and the following one appear to be a listing of the animals that the party took for food from March to August 1806.

A note to the side on the second page reads, "<a class="regularization" title="Collins, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collins%2C%20John">John Collins</a> game," but not all of the quarry on the list can be accounted
for in entries for corresponding days nor can they always be attributed specifically to <a class="regularization" title="Collins, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collins%2C%20John">Collins's</a> hunting. There is also the name "Richardson" at the end of the list, but its relation to the list is unknown and the person's identity cannot be determined. Some of the animals listed are crossed out and there is a large "X" across each page. Apparently there was a heading at the top of the first page, but only the last part is legible; it reads, "[Fort?] Clatsop 23rd March 1806.—"    Then follows this list:
