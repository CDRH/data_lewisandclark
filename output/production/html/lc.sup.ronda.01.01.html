The Indian relations of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition began long before the explorers nosed their boats into the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> current and headed upriver. <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span> knew that as his explorers moved over the visible world of rivers, mountains, and plains, they would also pass through a more important world—a sometimes invisible universe of Indian politics and European rivalries. He grasped what so often escaped others, that the American West was a crowded wilderness. Although nudged by reading <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> did not need the dour Scot to tell him that lands from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> to the great western sea were neither empty nor unclaimed. The political and economic face of the land had already been transformed by a generation of intense competition between tribal peoples and agents of <span class="tei_name">Spain</span>, <span class="tei_name">France</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span>. The president understood at least the outlines and implications of that struggle and the place of a latecoming American republic in it. If the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition was to be successful, whether for science, commerce, or statecraft, it would need to navigate through troubled Indian waters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
From the beginning, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> sought to fashion an expedition capable of gathering valuable information about western Indians while living at peace with them. That search became plain as he drafted instructions for his young secretary, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>. The president loved questionnaires. He used them to explore new areas of knowledge and then to organize what he had learned. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> only published book, <span class="italic">Notes on <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>,</span> was written in response to a questionnaire from the French diplomat and scientist <span class="tei_name">François Barbé-Marbois</span> and retained the question-and-answer form in its chapters. <a href="#n0101" id="ln0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> instructions to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> were a series of interlocking questions ranging from mineralogy to medicine. The ethnographic queries covered nearly every aspect of Indian life, including languages, customs, occupations, diseases, and morals.</p>
               <p>
Where did those very precise questions come from? The traditional answer has been that the Indian objectives pursued by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reflected <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> lifelong fascination with native American cultures. But there was more than one mind and one set of motives behind the expedition's Indian questions and its general policy toward native people. Early in 1803 <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> began to write friends both in and out of government asking their aid and advice for his western enterprise. In February he wrote three prominent <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> scientists, <span class="tei_name">Caspar Wistar</span>, <span class="tei_name">Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Dr. Benjamin Rush</span>, asking each to prepare some thoughts "in the lines of botany, zoology, or of Indian history which you think most worthy of inquiry and observation." <a href="#n0102" id="ln0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Even before his consultants submitted their questions, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> began to prepare a preliminary draft of the instructions. By mid-April 1803 he was ready to circulate it among certain cabinet members for their responses. The remarks of <span class="tei_name">Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin</span> focused on western geography and the future expansion of the United States. Later in his career <span class="tei_name">Gallatin</span> made a major contribution in collecting and systematizing Indian material in his "Synopsis of the Indian Tribes." But just how much he had to do with framing the expedition's Indian questions remains unclear. <a href="#n0103" id="ln0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> On the other hand, the reply from <span class="tei_name">Attorney General Levi Lincoln</span> clearly influenced <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> thinking. This important member of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> official family has not received much attention from students of western exploration. <span class="tei_name">Lincoln</span>, an able New England lawyer and a skillful Republican politician, understood that the expedition served many purposes. <span class="tei_name">Lincoln's</span> April 17 letter to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> suggests that the early draft of instructions he saw contained very little about Indians. To remedy this deficiency, Lincoln urged <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> to include questions about tribal religions, native legal practice, concepts of property ownership, and Indian medical procedures. Although <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was acquainted with smallpox inoculation, it appears that <span class="tei_name">Lincoln</span> was the first to suggest that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> take some cowpox matter along to administer to the Indians. If they were to have extensive contact with whites, they needed to be protected against smallpox. Dead Indians could not participate in an American trade network and dying natives could only blame the explorers for spreading disease. The attorney general's suggestions were of major importance, although he made them more out of political expediency than scientific curiosity. <span class="tei_name">Lincoln</span> was very sensitive to Federalist opposition to the journey, and indeed to any American westward expansion. He realized that the administration would need to justify the expedition on the high ground of science if it failed. <a href="#n0104" id="ln0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Levi Lincoln's</span> helpful comments sharpened <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> focus on Indians. That focus was further enlarged and refined in May 1803 when <span class="tei_name">Benjamin Rush</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> a detailed list of ethnographic queries. In 1774 <span class="tei_name">Rush</span> had presented a long paper before the American Philosophical Society titled "Natural History of Medicine among the Indians of North America." That discourse presented his thoughts on all physical aspects of Indian life from diet and hygiene to sexual performance and pregnancy. <a href="#n0105" id="ln0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The same wide range of interests was evident in a list <span class="tei_name">Rush</span> prepared for the expedition. That document was divided into three sections, with medical concerns predictably taking first place. Under the heading "Physical history &amp; medicine," <span class="tei_name">Rush</span> proposed twenty separate questions. He asked the explorers to record Indian eating, sleeping, and bathing habits as well as native diseases and remedies. The <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> savant wanted to know when Indians married, how long children were breast fed, and how long they lived. <span class="tei_name">Rush</span> even urged <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to find time to check Indian pulse rates morning, noon, and night both before and after they ate.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Rush's</span> interests went well beyond medicine, encompassing Indian customs and values as well. The second part of <span class="tei_name">Rush's</span> list included four questions touching on crime, suicide, and intoxication. His third section probed native American worship practices, sacred objects, and burial rituals. Like so many other European and American scientists, <span class="tei_name">Rush</span> was fascinated by Indian religions. Moreover, he believed, as did many of his contemporaries, that studies of Indian languages and religious ceremonies might prove or disprove a very old and persistent notion about the origin of native people. A widespread academic theory held that Indians might constitute one of the lost tribes of the children of Israel. If the Mandans were misplaced Welshmen, as so many thought, why not see if there were any Jewish Indians in the West? <a href="#n0106" id="ln0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By June 1803 <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had before him all the suggestions from fellow scientists and government officials. He also had delivered in January the confidential message to Congress that justified the expedition on grounds of extending the Indian trade. He could draw on instructions written for the abortive <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> expedition a decade before. <a href="#n0107" id="ln0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Sometime during June, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> synthesized these documents into a final draft of instructions for the expedition—instructions that now contained detailed questions in seventeen areas of Indian life and culture. Those questions covered everything from language and law to trade and technology. The explorers were to record what Indians wore, what they ate, how they made a living, and what they believed in. In short, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>: "You will therefore endeavor to make yourself acquainted as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit, with the names of the nations &amp; their numbers." <a href="#n0108" id="ln0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> reasons for converting two army officers and at least some of their companions into ethnographers were central to the many purposes of the journey. One of those aims linked exploration and business enterprise to national expansion. Finding the passage to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> was supposed to yield financial rewards. "The commerce," wrote <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, "which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will pursue, renders a knolege of those people important." <a href="#n0109" id="ln0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The president did not fully understand the complex character of trade systems already functioning on the northern plains and in the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> Northwest. But he was intent on expanding American commercial influence. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> knew that fur traders and other eager entrepreneurs needed to know about future markets and sources of supply. He envisioned western America as a vast trade empire to rival a similar system already being forged by agents of the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. If the United States was to compete in the great western space race, Indians needed to be wooed away from John Bull's Canadian traders and written into the ledger books of Uncle Sam's <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants.</p>
               <p>
But there was something else behind <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> requirement that the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition be an ethnographic enterprise—something beyond sea otters and beaver pelts. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were to gather material for another empire—the empire of the mind, the kingdom of knowledge. Like his friends at the American Philosophical Society, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wanted the expedition to make a lasting contribution toward the scientific understanding of North America. That was what he meant when he described the venture as a "literary expedition." The knowledge was not to be gathered by the explorers for its own sake, however, but in the service of government and commerce.</p>
               <p>
Finally, and not to be overlooked, there was <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> vision of the future of the American republic. He believed that accurate information about Indians was essential in order to shape a peaceful environment for both peoples. The desire for fact to replace speculation about native Americans was nothing new in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> mind. From boyhood he had had a passionate interest in things Indian. "In the early part of my life," he wrote, "I was very familiar with the Indians, and acquired impressions of attachment and commiseration for them which have never been obliterated." <a href="#n0110" id="ln0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> fascination with Indian life and lore was part boyish curiosity and part scientific enquiry, all bound up in the optimistic notion that if native Americans surrendered their traditional "savage" ways and adopted a white "civilized" life, both peoples could enjoy the continent in peace. "Acuiqre what knolege you can of [their] state of morality, religion &amp; information" was the way <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> put it to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. <a href="#n0111" id="ln0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> It was a Jeffersonian fundamental that if the two peoples knew each other more fully, each would treat the other with respect and consideration. Ethnography could make federal policy better informed and hence more humane. With an optimism based more on Enlightenment faith than American reality, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> assumed that a benevolent government would use such information to civilize and Christianize Indians. Whether or not native people would welcome the spiritual and cultural blessings of European civilization was, of course, the unasked question.</p>
               <p>
Ethnographical research was neither the prime nor the sole duty of the expedition. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wanted his explorers to take their scientific tasks seriously as they collected information and artifacts, but he had much more in mind. As representatives of the United States, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were expected to pursue the Indian policy goals of the republic. By 1803 those goals for the tribes east of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> were quite clear. Reflecting long colonial experience, federal Indian policy sought to acquire native lands at low cost while urging tribal people to shuck off hunting and breechcloths for plows and trousers. Couched in the language of Christian philanthropy, Jeffersonian Indian policy pursued national expansion with single-minded zeal. But in the West of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson was less certain of both policy and strategy. Those new lands were for traders, not white settlers. They might even provide refuge for native people dispossessed by the farming frontier.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> different approaches to tribes east and west of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> are plain in the language he used in addressing delegations from the various regions. In speaking to eastern delegations the president always coupled his program for civilization with land acquisition. To western delegations, including those organized by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, trade was the prime focus. When <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> drafted instructions for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> in 1803, negotiations with <span class="tei_name">France</span> were underway but the outcome was yet unclear. For that reason the diplomatic objectives enumerated in the directions for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> focused on trade while tactfully ignoring questions of power and sovereignty. The expedition was ordered to acquaint Indians with "the position, extent, character, peaceable and commercial disposition of the United States, and of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them." The factory system, a chain of government trading posts, had been an integral part of American policy since the mid-1780s. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> knew that attractive goods and suitable post locations were essential in the face of powerful British competition. For that reason <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was told to confer with Indians on "the points most convenient as mutual emporiums" as well as "the articles of most desirable interchange for them and us." <a href="#n0112" id="ln0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> expected that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would hold frequent conferences with Indians. But he also knew that the rigorous demands of travel made extensive talks impossible. Therefore <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was instructed to organize delegations of chiefs and elders to be sent to <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. Just as colonial Indian agents once sent <span class="tei_name">Mohawks</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cherokees</span> to <span class="tei_name">London</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> assumed that <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   in the Federal City would be properly impressed with the wealth and power of the new nation. And in an afterthought whose origins looked back to the earliest days of Indian-European encounter, the president hoped the expedition might find some young Indians willing to be "brought up with us, and taught such arts as may be useful to them." It was a dream that had haunted missionary and bureaucrat alike—native children gladly leaving their parents to embrace new fathers.</p>
               <p>
The creation of Indian delegations and a search for good trade sites were as close as <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> got in June 1803 to giving his explorers explicitly imperial and political directives. Although his commitment to an expanding nation was already plain, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was not about to give <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> instructions that violated territorial bounds as they existed before the Louisiana Purchase. The spread of American commercial influence would be quite sufficient. But once the purchase was diplomatic reality, announcing American sovereignty to native people became a vital part of the expedition's Indian policy. Parts of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> January 22, 1804, letter to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> can be seen as an appendix to the original instructions. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were now formally to extend American power up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and toward the mountains. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> own words indicate how much the diplomatic role of the expedition had expanded since the summer of 1803:
<blockquote><p>
Being now become sovereigns of the country, without however any diminution of the Indian rights of occupancy we are authorized to propose to them in direct terms the institution of commerce with them. It will now be proper you should inform those through whose country you will pass, or whom you may meet, that their late fathers the Spaniards have agreed to withdraw all their troops from all the waters and country of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, that they have surrendered to us all their subjects Spanish and French settled there, and all their posts and lands: that henceforward we become their fathers and friends, and that we shall endeavor that they shall have no cause to lament the change.
</p></blockquote>
In that same letter <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> the only order specifically naming a tribe and the policy to be pursued with it. The president drew on sources that included Jonathan Carver's <span class="italic">Travels through the Interior Parts of North America in the Years 1766, 1767, and 1768</span> (1778) and <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie's</span>
                  <span class="italic">Voyages . . . to the Frozen and <span class="tei_name">Pacific Oceans</span>
                  </span> (1801). More immediate information came from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> contacts. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> recognized the central role played by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   Indians in <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley trade and politics. He did not know the full complexity of the system that bound together British traders, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   hunters, and village farmers, nor did he realize just how far west 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   power had expanded. But the president did know that a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   blockade on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> could strangle an American fur trade empire based in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. "On that nation," he commanded <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "we wish most particularly to make a favorable impression, because of their immense power." <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> claim that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands were "very desirous of being on the most friendly terms with us" was mostly wishful thinking. But that exercise in hope ultimately pointed the expedition toward what proved a nearly fatal confrontation with the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span>
                  Sioux. <a href="#n0113" id="ln0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The expedition's success ultimately depended on friendly relations with the Indians. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was not about to unleash undisciplined adventurers to ride roughshod over them. Hostility between explorers and Indians could only endanger lives and weaken American influence. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> knew firsthand what historian Charles Royster has written about American army officers in the late eighteenth century. Those men "saw threats and slights everywhere and reacted with fury." <a href="#n0114" id="ln0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Fear of overreaction, especially on the part of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>, was also on <span class="tei_name">Levi Lincoln's</span> mind when he counseled <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> to avoid instructions that might lead the young officer to risk his life unnecessarily. "From my ideas of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span>," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lincoln</span>, "he will be much more likely, in case of difficulty, to push too far, than to recede too soon" <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> saw the wisdom in <span class="tei_name">Lincoln's</span> comments and changed the sentence in the instructions that once contained the phrase "certain destruction" to read instead "we value too much the lives of our citizens to offer them to probable destruction." <a href="#n0115" id="ln0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had shown considerable wisdom in making the exploration a military affair with proper organization and discipline. But he did not want the bumps and bruises of wilderness travel and encounters with strangers to provoke fatal overreaction. "In all your intercourse with the natives treat them in the most friendly and conciliatory manner which their own conduct will permit." That advice was not intended to understate the potential dangers or deny the expedition the ability to defend itself. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> understood the hazards. What he feared was that after months of hardship and frustration, some small incident might touch off a sudden burst of violence. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not to court self-destruction nor were they to wreak destruction on others. Survival would mean at least partial success; a glorious but futile death whether by accident or at the hands of an unknown foe would spell real failure.</p>

            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
Colonial experience taught that fruitful diplomacy and peaceful relations with native people required the exchange of gifts at each meeting. French and English forest diplomats learned that lesson early and did their best to offer goods of substance and quality. While some Europeans may have perceived those gifts as bribes to ensure compliance with treaty terms, heaps of blankets, pots, and guns meant something else to the Indians. In the act of reciprocal gift giving, different peoples symbolized their concern for each other. Neglecting to give gifts meant failure to "brighten the chain of friendship" that bound Europeans and Indians together. Giving and receiving soothed hurt feelings and reestablished broken relations. By the time <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> created the Corps of Discovery, gifts were a recognized part of the protocol of Indian diplomacy. To venture up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> without a carefully selected store of goods was to challenge foolishly the river gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew the gift-giving tradition and early in 1803 made note of funds to be set aside for presents for the Indians. In his initial tally of expedition costs, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> allocated $696 for trade goods. <a href="#n0116" id="ln0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Once in <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> early in May 1803, he set about the task of locating and purchasing a wide variety of goods. In notes made on what might be obtained as trade items, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> demonstrated a sure grasp of frontier economics. Blue glass beads headed his list of most sought-after objects. It is probable that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> learned from sources in the Pacific Northwest fur trade that those beads were "far more valued than the white beads of the same manufacture and answer[ed] all the purposes of money." Second on his list were common brass buttons, which the same sources may have told him were "more valued than any thing except beads." The explorer was also determined to find red-handled knives of the sort used by North West Company traders. Axes, tomahawks, moccasin awls, and camp kettles rounded out <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> catalog of high priorities. In addition to those items, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> planned to purchase substantial quantities of wampum, tobacco, and textiles. Vermilion face paint, one hundred cheap rings with glass stones, and a number of pairs of scissors completed his stock of essentials. <a href="#n0117" id="ln0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>

Using the services of <span class="tei_name">Israel Whelan</span>, purveyor of public supplies, and <span class="tei_name">General William Irvine</span>, superintendent of the <span class="tei_name">Schuylkill Arsenel</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was able to amass a substantial outfit of Indian goods. From merchants in and around <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> came everything from 4,600 sewing needles and 500 brooches to 8 brass kettles and 2,800 fishhooks. There were stocks of hawks bells, thimbles, ruffled shirts, and eleven dozen of those red-handled knives. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was to discover only later that there were not nearly enough blue beads or brass buttons, an oversight that cost the expedition dearly among the Nez Perce and <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> Indians. And at <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> direct command there were two corn grinders. They were there, one might guess, for use in teaching native farmers how to make pone and grits. <a href="#n0118" id="ln0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>

               <p>
All of the gifts stowed in the expedition's luggage for transport to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> had a purpose beyond diplomatic protocol. Those items, everything from ivory combs to calico shirts, represented what the United States offered to potential trading partners. As <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> repeated to every delegation of western Indians, Americans sought commerce, not land. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were on the road to show American wares. The expedition was the mercantile and hardware display case for a trade empire on the move. Moccasin awls and brass kettles were as much symbols of American power as the medals and flags destined for headmen and warriors. Few of those manufactured products were new to Indians, but the promise of regular supplies and fair prices was bound to have some result. The Industrial Revolution had come to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley half a century before and it was equally well established on the Northwest coast. But <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, surrounded by bright mirrors and yards of red flannel, offered more than goods. They proposed membership in a system with well-established posts and dependable delivery schedules. And always in the background, visible but rarely mentioned, were guns and ammunition. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not carry a special supply of weapons to offer for trade or as gifts, but they were not reluctant to promise firearms to potential customers and allies. Although <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and his explorers honestly pursued intertribal peace as a requisite to trade, arming friends seemed equally reasonable. What all those gifts represented was, in fact, the fundamental element in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> western Indian policy. Trade and diplomacy, commerce and sovereignty were all parts of the engine that drove American expansion and guided the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition.</p>

               <p>
On a snowy day at the end of December 1803, <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> moved into his hut at what has come to be known as <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span>. Situated on <span class="tei_name">Wood River</span> across the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> in present-day <span class="tei_name">Illinois</span>, the camp provided the Corps of Discovery with a convenient place to prepare for the first season of exploration. The winter of 1803–1804 at <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span> was more than a time to fit an odd lot of soldiers and frontiersmen to the discipline <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed essential for the expedition's success. The <span class="tei_name">Wood River</span> interlude allowed explorers time to gather and evaluate a large amount of information about the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> Indians. That material, coming from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> sources and from <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> himself constituted a crash course in Middle and Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> tribes: their numbers, locations, and possible reactions to the expedition.</p>
               <p>
No other city could have provided <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> explorers with such a range and quality of information about the Indians. The currents of the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> brought to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> not only pelts and skins but a vast store of knowledge and lore about the natives. Traders, merchants, government officers, and rough handed engagés all had experience that could prepare <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> for their Indian duties. The explorers needed to enter quickly that <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> world and tap its resources. That meant cultivating a friendly relationship with the brothers Chouteau, <span class="tei_name">Jean Pierre</span> and <span class="tei_name">René Auguste</span>, who had come to dominate the Indian trade around <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and were anxious to expand their influence under the new American regime. The Chouteaus and their circle of friends and relatives quickly sought out the explorers. Social calls at <span class="tei_name">Pierre's</span> house combined good food, friendly company, and valuable information. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> went so far as to boast that the Chouteau house became a virtual Corps of Discovery outpost during the winter. <a href="#n0119" id="ln0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The Chouteau connection brought <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> into contact with the city's best-informed merchants. There was so much information available that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> found it necessary to draft a form letter to give the data some structure. As he explained to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, "I have proposed many quiries under sundry heads to the best informed persons I have met with at <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and within the vicinity of that place; these gentlemen have promised me answers in due time." A list of questions <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> sent to <span class="tei_name">René Auguste Chouteau</span> early in January 1804 indicates the range of information the explorer was seeking. While most of the questions referred to white settlers and their current economic and political situation, there was room to comment on Indians and trade matters. <a href="#n0120" id="ln0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Because the Chouteaus made themselves so available and accommodating to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, there has been a tendency to overlook others who provided vital and perhaps more relevant Indian information. Chief among those were <span class="tei_name">John Hay</span> and <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span>. Hay, United States postmaster at <span class="tei_name">Cahokia</span>, was an experienced Indian trader on the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span>. He also spoke French, and when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> visited <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> commandant <span class="tei_name">Carlos Dehault Delassus</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hay</span> and his fellow trader <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Jarrot</span> went along to interpret. Even more important, <span class="tei_name">Hay</span> provided the link to <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span>. <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> was perhaps the most widely traveled of the many traders <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> met during the <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span> winter. During the 1780s, <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> explored the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mouse river</span>s and visited the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, along with North West Company employees from <span class="tei_name">Fort Esperance</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Qu'Appelle River</span>. By the mid-1790s the Scot had switched his political loyalties and was employed by the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>-based and Spanish-controlled Missouri Company. When he met <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> early in 1804, <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> had already ascended the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> as far as the <span class="tei_name">Omaha Indians</span> in what is now <span class="tei_name">Dakota County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>. Even more important, he had sent his Welsh lieutenant, <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span>, to the Mandans and had entertained notions of sending <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> across the mountains to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> call at <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span> on January 10, 1804, brought a lifetime of information on native people and Indian-white relations on the northern plains. Although <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not record what passed between the two explorers, there can be little doubt that their conversation was enlivened by <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> rich supply of experiences with the Indians. <a href="#n0121" id="ln0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recognized that men like <span class="tei_name">Hay</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span>, and the Chouteaus could offer invaluable information. But there were other sources of information in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, men of the river perhaps less literate but with more immediate experience among Indians. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> needed that sort of firsthand knowledge. While the captains could question their own engagés, some of whom had logged considerable river time, there were others beyond easy reach. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> explained it to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, "Some of the traders of this country from their continued intercourse with the Indians, possess with more accuracy many interesting particulars in relation to that people, than persons in a higher sphere of life." The problem was that those men lacked "both leasure and abilities to give this information in any satisfactory manner in detail." Determined to get that material, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> hit upon the idea of drawing "a form of paper containing 13 or 14 columns," each headed with a different topic relating to native people. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had already circulated such forms by late December 1803 and felt certain that his plan would yield important data. The questionnaires may have proved successful, but unfortunately, neither blank forms nor completed ones have survived. <a href="#n0122" id="ln0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> got more than talk from their <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> contacts. Friendly meetings brought maps and journals produced by earlier expeditions up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Of all the written material the explorers were able to study, none was more valuable for its Indian content than the journals and notes produced by <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span> and <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span>. In a letter to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> reported that he had obtained <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> journal material dating from 1795 to 1797. Those entries, written in French, were being translated by the ever-useful <span class="tei_name">John Hay</span>. <a href="#n0123" id="ln0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> No explorer destined for the northern plains could miss the import of those documents. Taken together, the <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>-<span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> file made several major points. There was the prospect of a rich trade to be exploited among both villagers and nomads. But success in that trade hinged on a reliable system with dependable Indian partners. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could not have missed <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> singling out of the Mandans as the Indians most helpful to traders. "The <span class="tei_name">Mandaines</span>," wrote <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span>, "as well all other nations that inhabit to their West, near the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, are in general people as good as they are mild who lay a great value on the friendship of the Whites." The <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>-<span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> material also revealed the extent of international competition for trade on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. French, Spanish, and English interests were already on the river, and reading <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> reminded the explorers that their diplomacy would be for high stakes. <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> observation that courting the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   could "put a Stop to the unjust progress of the English" was written for Spanish eyes, but its meaning was not lost on the Americans. <a href="#n0124" id="ln0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Finally, the <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>-<span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> journals brought home how much Indian opposition might be provoked by an American trade empire based in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, and some of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands had already made life miserable for traders bound upriver. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would have to deal with Indians who assumed it was their right to collect tolls on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> highway.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> materials were of such great importance that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> probably took along <span class="tei_name">Hay's</span> translation of <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> journal. It is more certain that a second document from <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> made the transcontinental passage. Sometime during the winter at <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> "Notes on Indian Tribes" came into the possession of the expedition. That twelve-page report summarized the trader's early experiences with the <span class="tei_name">Piegans</span> and his 1787 visit to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . In the "Notes" <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> offered a blend of current opinion on the origin and condition of the Indians and his own observations of their ways. He had something chatty to say on everything from religion to burials. Most important for the expedition's purposes, the trader made astute comments on the lives of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers. Drawing on his own visit to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Evans's</span> experiences with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> briefly described the construction of earth lodges, the layout of towns, and the yearly patterns of farming and hunting. <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> "Notes" was yet another text in <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> education. <a href="#n0125" id="ln0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The last piece of written material on Indian subjects had a <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> source but came to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> from <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>. In his November 16 letter to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, the president sent along extracts from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> trade journal attributed to <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Truteau</span>. Working for the Company of Explorers of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> traded upriver as far as the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> from 1794 to 1796. What <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> sent was a compilation of the tribes living along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and its tributaries. By studying the list, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could gain further information about their numbers and locations. Many tribes that figured in the expedition's future were briefly noted in the journal. Those included the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>, <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands, <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . Although the extracts did not plainly spell out the complex relations between those groups, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were at least beginning to fix peoples and places in the mental geography of the expedition. <a href="#n0126" id="ln0126" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Establishing hunting territories and village locations in their minds was made easier by several important maps <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> examined during the winter at <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span>. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gathered and compared maps, he was primarily in search of information to guide the expedition over the best route to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. But <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who emerged as the expedition's cartographer, could not have missed the substantial body of Indian data contained in many of the maps he studied. Three maps in particular held valuable information on village sites and native populations. Those maps gave visual expression to the written material coming into <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> hands.</p>
               <p>
Among the maps that the explorers looked at was one <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> described as "a general map of Uper <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>." It had been drawn by <span class="tei_name">Antoine Soulard</span>, surveyor general of Spanish Louisiana. <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> prepared the Spanish version in 1794–95 at the direction of Governor Carondelet to guide the explorations of <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste Truteau</span>. Sometime after the journeys of <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> and <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>, <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> drafted versions of the map with English and French legends. It was the English version, entitled "A Topographical Sketch of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and Upper <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> Exhibiting the Various Nations and Tribes who inhabit the Country," that now came into <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> possession. <span class="tei_name">Soulard's</span> map demonstrated with remarkable accuracy the locations of western Indians at the end of the eighteenth century. Along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and its tributaries <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> placed the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span>, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnee</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> peoples. Using simple circle and triangle symbols, the surveyor general noted <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages and the territories of nomadic 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>. Farther north Soulard sites the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> and <span class="tei_name">Chipewyans</span>. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Snakes</span> (
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  ) marked the western limit of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> knowledge. Looking at <span class="tei_name">Soulard's</span> map must have been a reassuring experience for the explorers: it showed the headwaters of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> within easy travel to what <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> labeled "Oregan or R. of the West." Indians that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had heard about from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> traders were on the map and in the expected places. This was not a map to chart a daily course on the river, but it did offer the sort of overview of the tribes that the explorers would need for much of their diplomacy. And because such diplomacy was closely linked to trade, <span class="tei_name">Soulard's</span> careful delineation of trade routes was a valuable bonus. <a href="#n0127" id="ln0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> certainly could have extracted a good deal of ethnographic information from the map. But at its best <span class="tei_name">Soulard's</span> creation did not reflect the kinds of immediate river and Indian contact the explorers sought. That sort of information could come only from maps drawn by <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span> and <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span>. After <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote to Indiana territorial governor <span class="tei_name">William Henry Harrison</span> seeking his help in locating accurate western maps, <span class="tei_name">Harrison</span> sent <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> chart of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> from <span class="tei_name">St. Charles</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. While having a far narrower range than the <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> map, <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> work did offer a precise, firsthand view of tribes and villages along the river. <span class="tei_name">Mackay's</span> sequence of Indian sites on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> was essentially correct, but his location of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages at longitude 110° west put those earth lodges some four hundred miles farther west than they actually were. Whatever its geographical misconceptions, the <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> map brought <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> another step closer to knowing what Indians were around the next bend in the river. <a href="#n0128" id="ln0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span> map was an important addition to the expedition's understanding of the plains landscape and its people. But a map made by <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span> became what one recent scholar has called a major "road map" for the expedition for no less than seven hundred miles. <a href="#n0129" id="ln0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> map of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> consisted of seven sheets depicting the course of the river and the location of the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span>, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. Those places along the river frequented by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands were also noted. By examining the <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> map along with the ones by <span class="tei_name">Soulard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackay</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could know with some certainty what Indian would be encountered next. The <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> map was taken on the voyage and became an invaluable tool for both navigation and diplomacy. All these maps completed what might be termed the expedition's academic education in the Indian geography of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley. The maps, journals, and river talk could not lessen the shock of encounter that lay ahead, but they might at least give the explorers a sense of the predictable in an uncertain land.</p>
               <p>
The first test of that education came even before leaving <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span>. The Indian presents so carefully purchased in <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> needed to be organized in some logical order. It made good sense to package trade goods, medals, flags, and fancy dress uniforms in the order in which they were to be distributed. Here again <span class="tei_name">John Hay</span> proved indispensable. As an experienced trader he knew the finer points of packaging and merchandising. It was probably <span class="tei_name">Hay</span> who suggested putting a variety of gifts into bags protected by waterproof fabric. Those bags were first divided into two general groups, one for the Indians on the river up to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and a second set for "foreign nations." All told, there were to be twenty-one bags of Indian goods. As <span class="tei_name">Hay</span> worked on packing in late April 1804, the explorers showed that they had learned their lessons well. Bundles were made up for the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>, <span class="tei_name">Poncas</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>. Knowing the great power of <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> leaders like the late <span class="tei_name">Chief Blackbird</span>, they set aside a separate part of one bag for the leading <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> chief. That bag had everything from a pair of scarlet leggings to a military officer's coat and American flag. There were similar bags for the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . For those Indians beyond the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   there were five bales stuffed with peace medals, fancy handkerchiefs, hat bands, and mirrors. <a href="#n0130" id="ln0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> The careful order in which those bales were packed annd numbered testified to how much <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had learned during the months at <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span>. On paper, at least, they knew the human contours of the land ahead. Those neatly tied packages should have been reassuring. But <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was not confident. Just one day before leaving <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span> he looked at the presents and thought they were "not as much as I think necessary for the multitude of Indians thro which we must pass on our road across the Continent." <a href="#n0131" id="ln0131" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>

As the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> flotilla—keelboat and pirogues—rocked against the river current, it represented months of careful preparation. Armed with calico shirts, peace medals, and blank vocabulary sheets, the expedition seemed ready to carry out its many Indian missions. But there was still one unanswered question, one nagging doubt that no talk, map, or journal could resolve. How would the explorers cope with the inevitable tensions hidden in dozens of encounters with the Indians? <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had long recognized the dangers. While working out travel schedules, he admitted that the accuracy of those time tables depended on "the probability of an oppisition from roving parties of Bad Indians which it is probable may be on the R[iver]." <a href="#n0132" id="ln0132" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a> Unchecked emotions, moments of fury from either Indians or explorers, could cost lives and destroy the expedition. Perhaps the greatest uncharted space ahead was a human space.</p>
               <p>
Into that emptiness went men of diverse backgrounds and unknown temperaments. Young frontiersmen recruited by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might have been crack shots, but would memories of Indian warfare on the dark and bloody ground of <span class="tei_name">Kentucky</span> boil up whenever they saw Indians? The expedition matched young privates like <span class="tei_name">George Shannon</span> with old hands <span class="tei_name">Hugh Hall</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben</span>. <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> engagés added river wisdom and colorful songs to the Corps. Among them <span class="tei_name">François Labiche</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span> stood out for their two winters spent at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Nodaway River</span> some 450 miles up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Towering over them all as a frontiersman was <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>. Born of French and Shawnee parents, he had spent years in the <span class="tei_name">Illinois</span> country. Woodsman, tracker, adept at sign language, <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> emerged as the expedition's chief hunter and scout. Young <span class="tei_name">John Colter</span> could not have had a better teacher. <span class="tei_name">New Hampshire</span>-born <span class="tei_name">John Ordway</span> quickly caught the captains' attention and became the Corps of Discovery's sergeant major. And there was <span class="tei_name">York</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> slave, whose blackness would fascinate and frighten so many Indians.</p>
               <p>
Finally, there were the captains themselves. Despite <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> assertion that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was chosen for his "familiarity with the Indian character," the young officer had neither fought Indians nor lived with them. <a href="#n0133" id="ln0133" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> He spoke no Indian languages. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> library might have been filled with books about Indians, but there is no direct evidence that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> read any of those volumes. His contacts with <span class="tei_name">Benjamin Rush</span> and other <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> students of native cultures were all too brief. In fact, <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> frontier experience was limited to travel in the <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span> country on missions for army paymasters and recruiters. Those journeys gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> firsthand knowledge of the officer corps—one of the reasons <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> selected him as private secretary—but they did not fit him to negotiate with confident chiefs and experienced warriors. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> life as soldier and surveyor did bring him into direct contact with Indians. Unlike many in his position, he had become an acute observer of native life and a confidant of chiefs and warriors—both ethnographer and diplomat. In ways that are beyond easy explanation, he enjoyed the company of Indians. Throughout his life <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> courted them, smoked with them, and shared food and stories with them. But this personal history was just a beginning. The expedition was to challenge each man in ways yet unimagined. Surveying their untested crew and themselves, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could only hope that the patience, skill, and courage of some would sustain all until the Corps of Discovery found its own soul.</p>

The "road across the Continent" began in mid-May 1804 as the expedition steadily left behind the familiar sights of <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span> and <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. In the days that followed there was time for a green crew to learn the dangers of falling banks, swirling currents, and hidden sawyers that could rip and overturn a craft. Those first weeks on the river brought reminders that the fur trade already reached far up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. The explorers saw rafts and canoes filled with furs from the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnee</span>
                   villages. River traffic also brought the expedition some valuable information. Late in May, around the isolated village of <span class="tei_name">La Charette</span>, the explorers met <span class="tei_name">Régis Loisel</span>. A prominent member of the Missouri Fur Company, he was on his way back downriver after establishing a post to garner the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> trade. The experienced <span class="tei_name">Loisel</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "a good Deel of information" about Indian relations far up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. He may well have urged the explorers to obtain additional aid from his partners <span class="tei_name">Pierre Antoine Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Joseph Garreau</span> at their <span class="tei_name">Cedar Island</span> post. <a href="#n0134" id="ln0134" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Early in June there was another fortunate meeting, this time with an Indian language interpreter. The expedition was not well prepared to deal with translation problems, especially those involving important conferences with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span> knew a few words and phrases and there were <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> signs. Coming upon another <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>-bound party of traders, the captains met <span class="tei_name">Pierre Dorion</span>. The Frenchman had spent some twenty years with the <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and their neighbors. He was just the sort of agent <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> needed to interpret at crucial conferences and to organize important delegations. <span class="tei_name">Dorion</span> was promptly hired with the understanding that he would remain with the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> to promote the expedition's Indian policy. <a href="#n0135" id="ln0135" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By the last days of July the expedition had passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Platte River</span>, known to old river hands as the dividing line between the lower <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and the middle reach of the river. Mosquitoes, gnats, and a prairie landscape were all unmistakable signs of the expedition's progress. Information gathered at <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and the words of engagés told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to prepare for their first meetings with Indians. Along these parts of the river the explorers expected to see <span class="tei_name">Oto</span>, <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ponca</span>, and perhaps 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnee</span>
                   Indians. On July 20, camped above present-day <span class="tei_name">Nebraska City</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> speculated that from his location a man could walk in two days to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                   on the <span class="tei_name">Platte</span> and in one day to the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>. Those Indians ought to be close at hand. Perhaps it was <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> or <span class="tei_name">Cruzatte</span> who told <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that at this time of year most river folk left their villages to hunt buffalo. Those hunts threatened to scuttle expedition diplomacy even before it was launched. <a href="#n0136" id="ln0136" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Two days later, some ten miles above the <span class="tei_name">Platte</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> settled into a place on the <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span> side of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> with the delightful name of <span class="tei_name">Camp White Catfish</span>. From that spot the explorers planned to send out parties to invite Indians for formal talks. On July 23 <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span> were given parcels of tobacco and ordered to find the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                  . Some signs, undisclosed in expeditionary records, suggested that at least a few river Indians had returned from hunting to obtain additional corn supplies. Taking this as a hopeful sign, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> confidently raised a flagstaff and waited anxiously for their native guests. Those preparations ended suddenly two days later when <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cruzatte</span> returned with unwelcome news. They had quickly found the major <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> town but it was quite empty. There were some traces of a small Indian party in the area, but neither scout could locate it. Disappointed and concerned, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided to press upriver in the hope that they might still come upon some Indians. <a href="#n0137" id="ln0137" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The expedition's fortunes took a change for the better on July 28 when <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> happened on a <span class="tei_name">Missouri Indian</span>. Once back at the expedition's camp, the Indian revealed that his own band was quite small, no more than twenty lodges. Their numbers now seriously depleted by smallpox, the surviving <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> lived with the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>. The main body of Otos was still out hunting. Acting on that information, the captains sent the engagé <span class="tei_name">La Liberté</span>, who could speak the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> language, back with the Indian to deliver a formal council invitation. The expedition planned to continue upriver and the Otos could find them farther along. At the end of July, in bottomland on the west bank of the river at what became <span class="tei_name">Fort Atkinson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, the expedition once again halted and waited for the Indians. <a href="#n0138" id="ln0138" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
After two days of patient waiting, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were plainly worried. They knew it might take some time for "much scatred" hunters to be located and to make their way to the river. Nonetheless, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could not help admitting, "We fear Something amiss with our messenger or them." The captains sent out another man to hurry <span class="tei_name">La Liberté</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>. <a href="#n0139" id="ln0139" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a> All that worry vanished at sunset on August 2 when a party of <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> appeared at the <span class="tei_name">Council Bluff</span> camp. Along with them was a trader whose name <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> rendered as <span class="tei_name">Fairfong</span>, although he has never been properly identified. <span class="tei_name">Fairfong</span> knew the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and had their trust. The leading <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> chiefs, <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span>, were not with the delegation but <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were gratified to see six headmen. At dusk the explorers arranged a hasty greeting, sent gifts of roasted meat, and asked the Indians to attend a council the next day. <a href="#n0140" id="ln0140" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As fog hung in the river bottoms on Friday morning, August 3, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> set about preparing for their first conference with the Indians. What the explorers did that morning linked them to generations of forest diplomats. The form and substance were dictated by common expectations resulting from years of woodland encounters. It was the sort of ritual <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had seen at the council negotiating the Treaty of Greenville with <span class="tei_name">General Anthony Wayne</span> in 1795. If the subsequent history of the expedition is any guide, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spent those early hours finishing his draft of a long speech proclaiming American sovereignty and the coming of new traders. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may well have spent the same time supervising the preparation of gifts. Opening bale number thirty, the men took out red leggings, fancy dress coats, and blue blankets. Setting aside flags and medals, they carefully packed the trade goods in individual bundles whose size and quality were determined by the rank of each chief. A special package was made up for the absent chief Little Thief. Although gifts and speeches had long been part of any Indian meeting, warriors and soldiers always made it a point to show military prowess as well. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were determined to impress every Indian they met with the power of the young republic. Sergeants <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Floyd</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> must have been busy that morning readying their squads for a formal dress parade. At the same time, other men were detailed to convert the keelboat's main sail into a temporary awning to shield the diplomats from the August sun. A flag and flagstaff completed the setting. What would become routine in the months ahead was still new and fresh, and there must have been an electric excitement in camp as the Corps of Discovery waited for the Indians to arrive.</p>
               <p>
At midmorning the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> delegation, with trader <span class="tei_name">Fairfong</span> in tow, assembled under the sailcloth awning to watch something like a <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Medicine Show. At the command, the expedition's troops shouldered arms, dressed right, and passed in review. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> then stepped forward to deliver a long speech summarizing federal Indian policy. Because its language and themes were to be repeated many times in the coming months, the speech is worth careful attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> began with the grand announcement of American sovereignty over the newly purchased lands. The <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> were told bluntly that their Spanish and French fathers had retreated beyond the eastern sea and would never return. In their place was a new father, the "great chief of the Seventeen nations," and it was his will that all would "now form one common family with us." Explaining the nature of the expedition's mission always proved a difficult task; the first time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> tried it the best he could do was declare that the explorers were on the river "to clear the road, remove every obstruction, and make it a road of peace." Just who was to mark out that "road of peace" and where it might lead were matters <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> addressed next. Urging the Indians to "shut [their] ears to the councils of Bad birds," the diplomat insisted that the new American father and his sons would bring peace and prosperity to "red children on the troubled waters." Those "red children" were required to make peace with their neighbors and trade with <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants. If those words were heeded, advised <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, traders would come, a post would be built near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Platte</span>, and the Indians would "obtain goods on much better terms than . . . before." But <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> words had the edge of threat as well. If river Indians ignored American orders and followed the "bad birds," trade would be cut off and there would be much suffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> concluded with what he saw as a crucial test of native willingness to accept the new order. He urged <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> chiefs to form a delegation to visit the great <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> chief. Those delegates could see for themselves both the wealth of the American nation and the contentment of Indians already living under the federal father. And if they submitted to the great chief, those in the delegation would be showerd with gifts and honors. Declaring that the traders of yesterday were gone, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> held out <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and the American nation as "the only friend to whom you can now look for protection." <a href="#n0141" id="ln0141" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Because chiefs like <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span> were not in camp, the responses offered by those Indians who were present did not capture much of the expedition's attention. But what fragments are in the record remain important to gauge early native reaction to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span>, soon to become a sergeant after the untimely death of <span class="tei_name">Charles Floyd</span>, said that the Indians were "well pleased" with the change in government. But that supposed pleasure at seeing new fathers was not widely felt by tribes along the lower river. Generated by news of the Louisiana Purchase, rumors had been flying for months that the Americans would radically change trading rules. In December 1804 a fearful <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> came to <span class="tei_name">Camp Dubois</span> filled with stories from an English trader who alleged that once the Americans had the country, trade would be disrupted. <a href="#n0142" id="ln0142" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> The reaction of some <span class="tei_name">Osages</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Arkansas River</span> was even more forceful. When a Chouteau agent announced the purchase, his letter was seized and burned, "the Indians not believing that the Americans had possession of the Countrey." <a href="#n0143" id="ln0143" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Some <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and their neighbors, who got goods from traders of various nationalities, may well have shared those concerns. The delegates at <span class="tei_name">Council Bluff</span> did nothing so dramatic, but they may have wondered about the economic consequences of new flags and medals hearing unfamiliar faces. In fact, what the chiefs did talk about was trade. The <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and their neighbors wanted a dependable source of goods. After years of spotty contact with English and French traders, the Indians were intent on finding and joining a reliable system. Complaining that Spanish and French traders "never gave them as much as a knife for nothing," it was plain that the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> hoped the Americans would be more generous. Although <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was unimpressed with the replies, calling the chiefs "no oreters," <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> found the speeches "very sensable."</p>
               <p>
The day ended with more gifts—powder, whiskey, face paint, and fancy garters—and ceremony. Peace medals were distributed and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> gave the first of many airgun demonstrations. That silent weapon was impressive, but promises of trade meant more to the assembled Indians. And if the explorers could negotiate a peace between the feuding <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>, that would surely add to American prestige. The Indians were both cautious and interested and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finished the meeting with a sense of achievement. Although <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span> had not spoken, the captains were confident that the wisdom of American policy, the lure of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade, and the force of federal arms would prevail. <a href="#n0144" id="ln0144" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Several days later <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> followed up what they viewed as an initial diplomatic success by sending a copy of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> speech and a parcel of gifts to <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span>. That an equally suitable gift and a medal of proper grade were not sent to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span> was an oversight due to the hurry to press upriver. The party transporting the goods was instructed to ask the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> to send a delegation toward the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> village, there to cement good relations. By August 12 the expedition had passed the hilltop grave of the mighty Omaha chief <span class="tei_name">Blackbird</span> near present-day <span class="tei_name">Macy</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, and expected to meet his successors at any moment. While the main body of the expedition stopped to prepare for an <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> council, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> was sent to find the Indians. At <span class="tei_name">Omaha Creek</span> near present-day <span class="tei_name">Homer</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and his squad walked into the empty village of <span class="tei_name">Tonwantonga</span>. In the 1790s, during the years of <span class="tei_name">Blackbird's</span> leadership, the earth lodge village had held over one thousand <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>. But the smallpox epidemic of 1800–1801 had dramatically reduced those numbers. <span class="tei_name">Tonwantonga</span> was vacant now as the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> were on the plains hunting buffalo. Although the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> were less powerful in the face of mounting 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   influence, their absence from home was a major disappointment. Any hope of negotiating an <span class="tei_name">Oto</span>-<span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> peace and bringing the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> into the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade system now seemed remote. Equally worrisome was the continued absence of the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> chiefs and the expedition party sent to find them. <a href="#n0145" id="ln0145" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
At least some of those problems were resolved on August 17. By this time the party had moved further up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, edging toward modern-day <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span>, <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span>. Toward evening <span class="tei_name">François Labiche</span> came into camp; he had been with the group sent to find the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and track down a deserter, <span class="tei_name">Moses Reed</span>. He reported that the rest of the party, including <span class="tei_name">Reed</span> and the chiefs <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span>, would arrive the next day. <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> further explained that the Indians were intent on making peace with the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>. "As the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> are not at home," sourly wrote <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, "this great Object cannot be accomplished at the time." The explorers could only hope that this would not deter the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> from accepting American proposals. <a href="#n0146" id="ln0146" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the following afternoon both the deserter and the chiefs came to camp. Making some shade near the keelboat, the captains briefly entertained the Indians before moving on to more immediate business—the trial of <span class="tei_name">Moses Reed</span>. As <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and the rest watched intently, <span class="tei_name">Reed</span> was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to run the gauntlet four times. Shocked by this spectacle of public punishment and humiliation, the chiefs asked that <span class="tei_name">Reed</span> be pardoned. Had it not been for the need to establish firm discipline early in the voyage, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might have sought to satisfy the visitors by granting their request. But it was not to be, and after they carefully explained the reasons for such punishment, the whole unhappy affair was done.</p>
               <p>
Even if the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span> could not be part of the coming council, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were anxious to know the reasons for trouble between those Indians and the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>. <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span> found no reason to conceal causes for the tensions. The chiefs promptly gave a quick lecture on the river realities of raid and truce. If the Americans expected <span class="tei_name">Oto</span>-<span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> conflict to turn on high policy disputes that could be settled by formal treaty, they were sorely mistaken. What unfolded was the tale of a horse-stealing raid by two <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> warriors against the <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>. The adventure had gone awry and in the fighting that followed, both men had been killed. Their deaths demanded retaliation. The <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> also had stormy relations with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                  . The chiefs admitted that theft of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnee</span>
                   corn while those people were off buffalo hunting was sufficient reason to fear revenge. What <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> recited were the common clashes that shaped prairie life. None of that denied the issues of trade and the struggles of the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span>, <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>, and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   to secure that trade. But the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> chief was offering a vision of the oridinary, the kind of affairs that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had neither the time nor the talent to understand and control. The explorers listened but did not seem to comprehend. They were already prisoners of grand but ill-conceived designs to reshape <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley Indian politics and economics to the requirements of American policy and commerce. The realities of personal insult and family revenge must have seemed petty by comparison. Yet those were the human passions that outlived all official plans from any new father. Even so, that evening, as everyone enjoyed a dance and an extra gill of whiskey to celebrate <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> birthday, problems personal and national seemed far away. <a href="#n0147" id="ln0147" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
How different the Indian and expedition agendas were became plain the next day. Assembled under a shade awning, chiefs and warriors listened as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> again explained American plans for intertribal peace and trade from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. Only bits and pieces of the replies from <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span> have survived, but what was recorded strongly suggests Indian expectations that did not match American designs. <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> agreed that peace would benefit all. He said that the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> had always been friendly with white traders, whether they were English or French. What counted, so argued the chief, was not nationality but the price and quality of trade goods. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could not have been pleased to learn that along the river the Stars and Stripes meant no more than the Union Jack or the Spanish ensign. Adding demand to insult, <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> wanted generous gifts from the hand of the new father. <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span> added to the growing confusion by insisting that without "a spoonful of your milk"—a polite way to ask for alcohol—his younger warriors could not be restrained from attacking the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Omahas</span>. Whiskey for peace was not the price the expedition was prepared to pay, nor was it diplomacy on the level of virtue expected by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>. And hard on this demand came a call from <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> for a delegation led by the trader <span class="tei_name">Fairfong</span> and <span class="tei_name">François Labiche</span> to make peace with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                  . When this request was flatly rejected, all talk ended in sullen silence.</p>
               <p>
Uncertain of their next move and fearing that the whole conference might dissolve in confusion, the captains decided that gifts, medals, and certificates of good behavior might appease the Indians. Parcels of tobacco, beads, and face paint were quickly distributed. Medals and certificates went to warriors like <span class="tei_name">Big Axe</span> and <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>. But those well-intentioned items sparked fresh misunderstanding. When the explorers had prepared bundles of trade goods and medals for chiefs who had not attended the August 3 gathering, they had not realized the approximate equality of status between <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and <span class="tei_name">Big Horse</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> chief had been sent a medal of lesser grade, and he now required one fitting his position. No sooner had that been accomplished than there was trouble in the ranks of the warriors. These men had expected substantial gifts and had received pieces of printed paper instead. No matter that the document proclaimed each Indian a "friend and ally" of the United States. One plainly disgusted warrior named <span class="tei_name">Big Blue Eyes</span> made it clear what he wanted and abruptly handed back the certificate. Some moments later the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> had second thoughts and asked that it be returned. Angered at what seemed a lack of respect for official documents, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> refused and "rebuked them very roughly for having in object goods and not peace with their neighbors." Those pointed words may have been an accurate estimate of <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> priorities, but they were hardly salve for bruised feelings. <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> finally put the matter to rest and asked that <span class="tei_name">Big Blue Eyes</span> be restored to the expedition's good graces. Not so quick to forgive, the explorers handed the paper to <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span>, saying that he could present it to the offending warrior.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had expected the Indians' quick acceptance of American policies. All the gifts and military show were aimed at producing that result. On the other hand, the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> imagined wonderful giveaways of valuable goods from what seemed an endless supply on the keelboat. <span class="tei_name">Little Thief</span> and the other chiefs knew that their influence was in decline as 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and upriver villagers garnered a steadily larger share of the trade. Each expected too much from the other, and the day seemed to be ending in squabble and petty dispute. Trying to conclude the conference on a positive note, the explorers initiated a second round of gifts. Whiskey, keelboat curiosities like the ever impressive magnet and telescope, and an airgun show ended the council. Or at least <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> thought that the gathering was finished. Discontented with skimpy presents, many Indians remained in camp asking for whiskey and trade items. What had been planned as an impressive day of solemn talk and American power tailed off in misunderstanding and confusion. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not about to alter either their goals or their tactics, but what happened in the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span>-<span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> talks should have been a warning of difficulties ahead. <a href="#n0148" id="ln0148" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The meetings with the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indians were the first tests of the expedition's diplomatic skill. They were also a time to learn patience in the face of those who found the explorers' proposals either incomprehensible or confusing. Those August councils produced mixed results. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might announce American sovereignty and assert that trade contacts were established, that sites were marked for future posts, and that intertribal peace was being promoted. The Corps of Discovery might be learning to live with the Indians. But a closer look makes those assertions appear less substantial. The <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and their neighbors wanted trade. With what nation and under whose flag mattered not at all. Promises of peace with nearby Indians, no matter how honestly made, bound no one. As the expedition made its way up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and into <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   territory, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could realistically claim little success. They were now entering a plains world infinitely more complex than any they had encountered on the lower river.</p>
               <p>
On August 27, as the expedition passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">James River</span>, an Indian boy swam out to hail one of the pirogues. When the Americans pulled their boats on shore, two more Indian youths appeared. These Indians—two <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> and an <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span>—told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that there was a large <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> camp not far up the <span class="tei_name">James</span>. Eager to talk with these Indians, the captains sent <span class="tei_name">Pierre Dorion</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</span> to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   village. Toward evening <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and <span class="tei_name">Dorion</span> reached the <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> camp and received an enthusiastic welcome. Following tradition, the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> wanted to carry <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> into camp on a buffalo robe. It was to be more than a ride; it was a sign of honor and distinction. But the sergeant hastily declined, explaining that he was not the owner of the great boat now on the river. The <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> were not to be denied, however, and <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> and <span class="tei_name">Dorion</span> were treated to a feast of fat dog, yet another sign of special attention. <a href="#n0149" id="ln0149" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The warm greeting extended to <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> mirrored the <span class="tei_name">Yankton's</span> eagerness to talk with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. All of this was genuine hospitality and something more. What lay behind the offered buffalo robe procession and dog dinner were <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> concerns about their own role in a rapidly changing plains world. The <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> did trade to the east with North West Company posts and had occasional visits from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants, but they needed a place in some dependable commercial system. They also needed protection from their more aggressive neighbors the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>. When <span class="tei_name">Dorion</span>, now joined by his son <span class="tei_name">Pierre</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> brought the <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> delegation to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> shore opposite <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span>, both the Indians and the explorers anticipated a successful meeting.</p>
               <p>
The morning of August 30 found the Corps of Discovery camped at <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span> on the west side of the river at the site of today's <span class="tei_name">Gavins Point Dam</span>. As the sun burned off an early fog, the explorers busied themselves with council preparations. What had been done for the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> was now readied for the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span>. Even before breakfast, some inquisitive Yanktons swam the river to watch the mysterious doings of the bearded strangers. At 9:00 <span class="smallcaps">A.M.</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were ready to begin their first conference with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . While the <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> meetings were important as first forays in frontier diplomacy, the explorers knew that talks with any 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   group would be of lasting significance. If the American fur trade empire was to move from the realm of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> imagination to commercial reality, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   cooperation and participation were essential. Knowing all that, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dispatched a pirogue across the river to begin the proceedings.</p>
               <p>
If the stakes were high for American diplomacy in the new West, they were equally high for the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span>. Chiefs like <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> and <span class="tei_name">White Crane</span> made that plain as they entered the precincts of <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span> in high ceremony. The whole <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> delegation was preceded by four musicians, singing and playing as they paraded through the camp. That sense of drama was heightened when the captains ordered the bow swivel gun on the keelboat fired. Ritual payments of tobacco were made to the musicians; the conferees shook hands and then sat down to hear <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> present the American proposals. His speech, translated by <span class="tei_name">Pierre Dorion, Sr.</span>, lasted until late in the afternoon. The expedition's records do not contain a full text of the speech, but some clues in <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> journal suggest that it focused on peace with the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouris</span> and on arranging a major delegation of chiefs from several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands. Probably, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> proclaimed American sovereignty and promised reliable trade from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. When the speech ended, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> handed out medals to five of the <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> chiefs. <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span>, sometimes known as <span class="tei_name">La Liberator</span> or the <span class="tei_name">Handshake</span>, was pronounced first chief and given a red-laced coat, military cocked hat, and American flag. The Indians retreated to the shade of some cottonwoods and divided the presents.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition came to the northern plains as outsiders, but that night the explorers became part of a prairie community. In the late afternoon they provided beads as prizes when <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> boys showed their skill with bow and arrow. At dark a crackling fire was built in the center of camp. Into the firelight came men in gaudy paint to dance and sing of their great feats in battle and the chase. Music came from a drum whose deerskin head was a gift from <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. While drummers beat out a powerful rhythm, other Indians kept time with deer hoof rattles. Later, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> recalled the vivid sights and sounds of that <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span> spectacle. "It always began with a houp and hollow and ended with the same, and in the intervales one of the warriors at a time would rise with his weapon and speak of what he had done in his day and what warlike actions he had done. This they call merit. They would confess how many horses they had Stole." Perhaps instructed by <span class="tei_name">Dorion</span> and his son, members of the expedition threw the dancers gifts of tobacco, knives, and hawks bells. For the Corps of Discovery, this would be a night to remember when times were harder and there was less to celebrate. <a href="#n0150" id="ln0150" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were beginning to learn that the protocol of Indian diplomacy required time for chiefs and elders to hammer out replies to any proposal. But <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> and his fellow <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> had no desire to keep the Americans waiting. Very early on the morning of August 31, the Indian delegation returned with their answers. That there were several responses and not one common reply from the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> was another part of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> education in native political realities. <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> wasted no time revealing what was uppermost in his mind. Reliable trade connections were essential for the survival of the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span>. The chief reported that he and his warriors lacked both firearms and ammunition. Their women and children were destitute. Weuche wanted immediate relief, a request he thought not unreasonable in view of the riches of the keelboat. As an alternative, the chief suggested that his warriors be permitted to stop the next trade boat from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and help themselves to whatever was necessary.</p>
               <p>
But economics was not the only item on <span class="tei_name">Weuche's</span> agenda. As an astute plains politician, he quickly recognized that close ties to the new father would both protect and enhance the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons'</span> influence. <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> cleverly offered his services to organize a large delegation from many bands the following spring. While not denying that men like <span class="tei_name">Pierre Dorion</span> and his son would be useful in that effort, the chief made it clear that ultimate success hinged on his good offices. And as for intertribal peace, <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> again suggested that affairs be left in his hands. Explaining that other Indians "would hear him better," the chief assured <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that he could be trusted as a faithful intermediary. Finally, <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> brought his comments full circle by returning to the trade issue. This time the chief took careful note of the international nature of the plains economy. <span class="tei_name">Weuche</span> reported that he had already held English and Spanish medals. But, he pointedly complained, the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> needed more than bits of bronze and silver to fend off poverty. At this point, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may well have become worried by constant references to trade goods. They had already chastised one <span class="tei_name">Oto</span> for paying undue attention to knives and beads. If the friendly <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> thought the expedition was really a trading venture, then less hospitable Indians farther upriver might stop and plunder the Americans. At the end of <span class="tei_name">Weuche's</span> talk and before the other chiefs began to speak, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> again attempted to explain the nature of their mission. He insisted that the explorers were not traders but had come only to open the road for others. He assured the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> that honest traders with quality goods were not far behind. But the concept of exploration as a national undertaking had no precedent in tribal life. A keelboat filled with what seemed an endless store of goods only served to confuse the question.</p>
               <p>
Although the nature and purpose of the expedition was no clearer in <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span> minds, other chiefs like <span class="tei_name">White Crane</span> and <span class="tei_name">Half Man</span> needed to be heard. Their replies generally followed a common pattern. All agreed that trade and peace were worthy objectives. Of all the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> who spoke during the day, none offered more important advice than <span class="tei_name">Half Man</span>. The chief made the expected promises, declaring his interest in peace with the <span class="tei_name">Otos</span> and a desire to see the great <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> chief. But at the end of his remarks, <span class="tei_name">Half Man</span> added a prophetic warning. "I fear," he said, "those nations above will not open their ears, and you cannot I fear open them." <a href="#n0151" id="ln0151" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Half Man's</span> dark words were hard to take seriously in an atmosphere of friendship and productive negotiation. The day ended with yet another show of airgun firepower and keelboat curiosities. Gifts of corn and tobacco to the <span class="tei_name">Yanktons</span> seemed to seal agreements while <span class="tei_name">Dorion's</span> plans to remain with them augured well for the organization of delegations. On the surface, at least, the council was a grand success. Here were 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   headmen and warriors who welcomed the Americans and gladly joined the new trade system. The expedition's diplomacy appeared to have come of age. To that achievement was added the collection of important ethnographic information. <a href="#n0152" id="ln0152" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Just as significant, the expedition had enjoyed good relations with a powerful people. Worries about "the nations above" were easily discounted in the glow of proceedings at <span class="tei_name">Calumet Bluff</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were so confident of continued success in dealing with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   that they did not think twice about leaving behind the only skilled interpreter. That the expedition's fortunes were about to slide into a morass of angry words and hostile gestures seemed remote. For now there were new plains sights to capture the explorers' attention. Again finding the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> channel, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> moved deeper into an Indian world that would both baffle and challenge the Corps of Discovery.
