This morning was calm fair and warm; the Musquetoes of course troublesome.    all hands that could work were employed about the canoes.    which we completed and launched this evening.    the one was 25 feet and the other 33 feet in length and about 3 feet wide.    we have now the seats and oars to make and fit &amp;c. I walked out today and ascended the bluffs which are high rockey and steep; I continued my rout about 3½ when I gained a conspicuous eminence about 2 mes. distant from the river a little below the entrance of Fort Mountain Creek. <a href="#n16071401" id="ln16071401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    from this place I had a commanding view of the country and took the bearings of the following places.
