We set at sunrise and proceed through the open plain as yesterday up the North side of the river.    the plains are more broken than they were yesterday and have become more inferior in point of soil; a great quanty of small gravel is every where distributed over the surface of the earth which renders travling extreemly painfull to our bearfoot horses.    the soil is generally a white or whiteish blue clay, this where it has been trodden by the buffaloe when wet has now become as firm as a brickbat and stands in an inumerable little points quite as formidable to our horses feet as the gravel.    the mineral salts common to the plains of the missouri has been more abundant today than usual.    the bluffs of the river are about 200 feet high, steep irregular and formed of earth which readily desolves with water, slips and precipitates itself into the river as before mentioned frequentlly of the bluffs of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> below which they resemble in every particular, differing essencially from those of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> above the entrance of this river, they being composed of firm red or yellow clay which dose not yeald readily to the rains and a large quantity of rock. <a href="#n37072001" id="ln37072001" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> the soil of the river bottom is fertile and well timbered, I saw some trees today which would make small canoes.    the timber is generally low.    the underbrush the same as before mentioned.    we have seen fewer buffaloe today than usual, though more Elk and not less wolves and Antelopes also some mule deer; this speceis of deer seems most prevalent in this quarter.    saw some gees ducks and other birds common to the country.    there is much appearance of beaver on this river, but not any of otter. <a href="#n37072002" id="ln37072002" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    from the apparent decent of the country to the North and above the broken mountains I am induced to beleive that the South branch of the <a class="regularization" title="Saskatchewan River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saskatchewan%20River">Suskashawan</a> receives a part of it's waters from the plain even to the borders of this river <a href="#n37072003" id="ln37072003" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and from the brakes visible in the plains in a nothern direction think that a branch of that river decending from the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountains</a> passes at no great distance from <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Maria's river</a> and to the N.

Late Pleistocene glacial ice in this area displaced the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias River</a> southward from its preglacial course. The displaced <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias River</a> then cut a new valley in older glacial till and into shale of the <a class="regularization" title="Colorado Group" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Colorado%20Group">Colorado Group</a>. This downcutting produced a more rugged topography here than it did farther to the east. The gravel is both glacial outwash and cobbles that were left behind when the finer-grained portion of the till eroded. The glacial till that overlies the <a class="regularization" title="Colorado Group" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Colorado%20Group">Colorado Group</a> was derived from this same formation farther to the north. In this area the till is composed of silt- and clay-sized particles and is highly impregnated with salts such as calcium-magnesium sulfate/bicarbonate. When the clay dries out it becomes exceedingly firm, resembling adobe. The bluffs near the river are composed mainly of goacial till. The till does not dissolve but erodes easily in contact with running water. The running water undercuts the banks and they slide or fall down into the river.
