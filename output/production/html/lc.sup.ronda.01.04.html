As the fall days of 1804 grew colder and shorter, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition struggled toward what has been called "the keystone of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> region"—the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. <a href="#n0401" id="ln0401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The American explorers were only the latest in a long series of traders and travelers making the journey to the earth lodge villages along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns were the center of northern plains trade, attracting Indian and white merchants over vast distances. At trading times, especially during the late summer and early fall, the villages were crowded with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crows</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Kiowas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Arapahoes</span>, and, after midcentury, with whites representing the North West Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> interests. In the arena of frontier culture, few places gave more evidence of the varied objects and diverse peoples making up North America than the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns. The winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> would expose <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to much of that variety and diversity. The winter would try the expedition's diplomatic skill and expand its ethnographic horizons. At the same time, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> people would get their first long look at the coming wave of American traders and bureaucrats. Those long <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> months were an apprenticeship during which each group probed the other and formed lasting impressions.</p>
               <p>
A traveler coming up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> in 1804 would have found five Indian settlements—two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and three <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>—strung out along the river in what is now central <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. Past the <span class="tei_name">Heart River</span>, the first town was the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village known to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as <span class="tei_name">Matootonha</span>. More correctly named <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>, this village was located on the west bank of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> as "situated on an eminance of about 50 feet above the water in a handsome plain." <a href="#n0402" id="ln0402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Like its sister village across the river, <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> was built by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   sometime around 1787. In most of their notes, the explorers referred to <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> as the "lower" or "first" <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> reported that the village had about forty earth lodges. Because <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> was the closest <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village to the expedition's winter quarters, the explorers became very familiar with both the town and its leading chiefs. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, known to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as <span class="tei_name">Big White</span>, was the most prominent civil chief in <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. The captains named <span class="tei_name">Kagohhami, or Little Raven</span>, also a civil chief, as Second Chief.</p>
               <p>
Farther up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, directly north of <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> and on the east bank of the river, was the second <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> settlement. Throughout the expedition's records this town of about forty or fifty earth lodges was called <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>. <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> was a mispronunciation of Nuptadi, one of the four <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> subtribes existing before the 1781 smallpox epidemic. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> often called <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> the "upper" or "second" <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village. Because it was the home of <span class="tei_name">Posecopsahe</span>, or <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, the civil chief designated Grand <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Chief by the explorers, <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> took on special significance for the expedition's diplomacy. <span class="tei_name">Cargarnomakshe, or Raven Man Chief</span>, was made Second Chief of <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> by the captains.</p>
               <p>
Directly across the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> from <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> was a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> village so distinct from the two other <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns that virtually every European visitor noted the differences. Known as <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>, the village was established about 1787 by the <span class="tei_name">Awaxawi Hidatsas</span>. Built on a terrace overlooking the confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Knife</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> rivers, <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span> had about fifty warriors in 1804. The captains knew these people as the <span class="tei_name">Amahami, Ahaharway, or Wattasoon Indians</span> and always distinguished them in their records from the two other <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> groups. Although the <span class="tei_name">Awaxawis</span> were linguistically distinct from their <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> neighbors on the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>, they were not a separate tribe as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed. The <span class="tei_name">Awaxawis</span> called themselves <span class="tei_name">Ahaharways or Ahnahaways</span>; <span class="tei_name">Wattasoon</span> was their <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> name. French traders nicknamed them the "soulier" Indians and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> occasionally termed the <span class="tei_name">Awaxawis</span> as the Shoe or Moccasin people. The captains had some contact with the <span class="tei_name">Awaxawi Hidatsas</span> of <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span> through <span class="tei_name">Tatuckcopinreha, or White Buffalo Robe Unfolded</span>, the most prominent village chief.</p>
               <p>
Along the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found the two major <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> settlements. On the right bank of the <span class="tei_name">Knife</span>, about a mile from the confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, was the town <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called the "First <span class="tei_name">Minnetaree</span> Village," or "the little village of the <span class="tei_name">Menitarras</span>." Built about 1787 by <span class="tei_name">Awatixa Hidatsas</span> and home to a substantial number of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> families as well, the village was properly known as <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span>. Village residents were sometimes named in expedition journals as <span class="tei_name">Minnetarees Metaharta</span> or the <span class="tei_name">Minnetarees of the Willows</span>. <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> has special significance for the history of the expedition since it was there that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   woman <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and the North West Company trader <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span> lived before joining the Corps of Discovery. Leadership in the village, as recognized by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, came from First <span class="tei_name">Chief Ompsehara, or Black Moccasin</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Second Chief Ohharh, or Little Fox</span>. <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> would continue to be an important <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> village of some forty lodges until its destruction, along with <span class="tei_name">Mahawha's</span>, by a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   raid in the spring of 1834.</p>
               <p>
The most remote of the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages, both in terms of distance and expeditionary diplomacy, was <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, generally known in the journals as the "<span class="tei_name">second Minnetaree Village</span>." Established sometime before 1780 by the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>-proper, <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span> was the largest of the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns, boasting some 450 warriors and 130 earth lodges during the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> era. <span class="tei_name">Menetarra's</span> assets were not only substantial population and considerable military force but exceptional leadership in the person of <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne, or One Eye</span>. <a href="#n0403" id="ln0403" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Observing <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages during the summer of 1806, <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span> described them as "a cluster of molehills or muskrat cabins." The trader explained that on closer examination "the nearly circular huts are placed very irregularly; some so close to each other as scarcely to leave a foot-passage, others again at a distance of 20 to 30 feet apart. But about the center of each village is an open space of about four acres, around which the huts are regularly built at equal distances, fronting the open space." <a href="#n0404" id="ln0404" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> For both <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> households the village was the focus of important political, economic, and ceremonial activities. In many ways the villages can be best understood as a collection of households all acting together to advance the welfare of the family, the clan, and the village.</p>
               <p>
Just as the medicine lodge was the focal point for <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages, the center of a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village was the sacred cedar post and the open plaza around it. The cedar post represented <span class="tei_name">Lone Man</span>, the primary <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> culture hero. On the north edge of the plaza was the large medicine or Okipa lodge. Hanging on poles outside the Okipa lodge were effigies representing various spirits. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages seen by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> consisted of about forty to fifty domestic lodges arranged around the plaza. The social position of each household determined the location of lodges. Those families with important ceremonial responsibilities and those who owned powerful bundles lived near the plaza while less prominent households occupied lodges farther away. <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> earth lodges were usually occupied for anywhere between seven to twelve years. Each lodge housed from five to sixteen persons with the average number in a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> lodge being ten persons. <a href="#n0405" id="ln0405" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> At the time of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages were defended by log palisades.</p>
               <p>
These villages, so familiar from the descriptions of explorers and traders like <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span> and nineteenth-century artists like George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, were in fact only part of the settled experience of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villagers. They divided their time between large, permanent summer lodge towns and smaller winter camps. The winter lodges, built in wooded bottoms to escape the harsh winter storms, were neither large nor especially well constructed. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not comment on these winter camps, and it is possible that fear of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   attack kept many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> within the protection of the more substantial summer villages. Looking down on the towns from a high riverbank, <span class="tei_name">David Thompson</span> was reminded of "so many large hives clustered together." <a href="#n0406" id="ln0406" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> And so must they have seemed to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> seven years later.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not the first white men to see the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages and their surrounding fields of corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. The first recorded European visit to the villages had occurred on the afternoon of December 3, 1738, when Pierre Gaultier de Varennes de La Vérendrye, accompanied by French traders and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   guides, entered a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> "fort" near the <span class="tei_name">Heart River</span>. Attracted by tales of fair-skinned, red-haired natives who lived in large towns and possessed precious metals, La Vérendrye had made the long journey from <span class="tei_name">Fort La Reine</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine River</span> to see those mysterious people. Although La Vérendrye did not find the fabled white Indians, he did record the first European impressions of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> lifeway. That record, taken along with evidence preserved from the 1742–43 visit of La Vérendrye's sons to the region, offers the picture of prosperous earth lodge people living along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> near the <span class="tei_name">Heart</span> and already enjoying French and Spanish goods. <a href="#n0407" id="ln0407" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
With the disruptions caused by French and English conflicts that finally cost <span class="tei_name">France</span> its Canadian empire, the tenuous foreign contacts with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages were lost, at least to the written record. There is no doubt that European goods continued to enter the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> carried by native middlemen. In the second half of the eighteenth century, some Canadians were beginning to reside in the village as "tenant traders." These were men like the little-known <span class="tei_name">Montreal</span> trader Mackintosh, who visited the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   in late 1773, and the long-term residence <span class="tei_name">Pierre Menard</span>, who came in 1778. Mackintosh and <span class="tei_name">Menard</span> were among the last to see the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> village Indians in the days of high prosperity before the devastating epidemic of 1781. In the years after 1781, weakened by disease and threatened by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   abandoned the <span class="tei_name">Heart River</span> villages. Their move north was toward the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> and an uneasy alliance with the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. It was there that <span class="tei_name">James Mackay</span> found them when he came from the <span class="tei_name">Qu'Appelle River</span> to trade in 1787. Throughout the 1790s, contacts with both Canadian and <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> traders increased as men like <span class="tei_name">Jacques D'Eglise</span>, <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span>, and <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span> waged economic war to gain control of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> trade. The presence of these men and their goods did not immediately threaten the well-being of the villagers. Quite the contrary, the trade items (especially guns and ammunition) strengthened the villagers against their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> enemies. The traders were simply adopted as fictional relatives, a practice first noted by La Vérendrye and surely employed long before 1738 with Indian middlemen. <a href="#n0408" id="ln0408" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>

The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages have been aptly described as "the central market place of the Northern Plains." <a href="#n0409" id="ln0409" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> It was this great <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> country store that attracted so many Europeans, as well as Indians. The transactions at this crossroads of cultures and goods touched the lives of people far from central <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> and in turn conditioned the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  ' and the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas'</span> relations with all outsiders. At that market one could find Spanish horses and mules brought by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , destined for 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   herds; fancy 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   leather clothing for <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> dandies; English trade guns and ammunition eagerly sought by villagers and nomads alike; and the ever present baskets of corn, beans, squash, and tobacco upon which <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> economic strength was built. Forming the upper exchange center in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Trade System, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villagers served as brokers in an international economic and cultural trade network that faced in three directions and stretched over thousands of miles.</p>
               <p>
Like their <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> neighbors, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages shared an important western connection with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Arapahoes</span>. These nomadic plains people brought a wide variety of meat products as well as luxury leather goods to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> market. But in the eyes of all villagers, the most valuable commodity brought from the West and Southwest were horses and mules. Just as the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> sought those animals to supply the needs of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , so did <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> traders bargain for them to satisfy the requirements of their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Cree</span> customers. Reaching east, the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> brokers also did some trading with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands who brought buffalo meat and some manufactured goods from the Dakota Rendezvous. However, the close trade ties between the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and the frequent raids that alliance visited on the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns made the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   connection somewhat risky.</p>
               <p>
If the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   could not be relied upon to bring European goods to the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> villages as they did to the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> towns, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> people had to find another and more reliable source of supply. So the third face of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> system looked north to the many bands of <span class="tei_name">Crees</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  . Long before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Crees</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   had been carrying English and French goods to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns to exchange for agricultural produce, tobacco, and horses. When La Vérendrye visited the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   in 1738, he saw the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   trade in full swing. The French explorer, impressed with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  ' business skill, wrote that the villagers "knew well how to profit by it in selling their grains, tobacco, skins and colored plumes which they knew the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   prize highly." As testimony to the penetration of European goods into the northern plains well before the middle of the eighteenth century, La Vérendrye observed that the most sought-after merchandise brought by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   were "guns, axes, kettles, powder, bullets, knives, [and] awls." <a href="#n0410" id="ln0410" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>

               <p>
Whenever <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> analyzed an Indian trade system, they always thought in terms of the distribution of political power in that network and possible future competition with American merchants. Regarding the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Trade System, they believed that the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   needed to be weaned away from North West Company traders and brought into the sphere of the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> interests. Beyond that, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were always eager to cast the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   as colonial masters exercising political and economic dominance over the innocent and vulnerable <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. The message was simple. The political and economic power of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   needed to be broken and the honest villagers freed so that they could participate in the new American trade system.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomacy attempted to impose the same simplistic model on the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> trade with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Crees</span>. Those tribes provided manufactured goods from English and Canadian sources that might be supplied by American merchants. Knowing there was often tension between the villagers and their northern trading partners, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> used such strife as a pretext to lecture <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs on the reasons for abandoning the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Crees</span> in favor of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> traders. What the captains did not grasp was that the merchandise exchanged between the villagers and the northern peoples—food products and horses—did not in the least interest Americans increasingly obsessed with beaver pelts. Despite this, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> still told <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs, "You know yourselves that you are compelled to put up with little insults from the <span class="tei_name">Christinoes [Cree]</span> and <span class="tei_name">Ossinaboins</span> because if you go to war with those people, they will prevent the traders in the North from bringing you guns, powder, and ball and by that means distress you very much." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was determined to cast the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> in the same role as the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> with the new oppressors as 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Crees</span>. If the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were the masters lower down the river, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> seemed prepared to brand the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   as "great rogues" from the north. <a href="#n0411" id="ln0411" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Just as the captains had misunderstood <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   relations much to the detriment of the expedition's Indian diplomacy, so they failed to appreciate both the ability of the villagers to cope with the northern nomads and the essential equality of the trade arrangement. Because he saw actual trade bargains made between the two parties, La Vérendrye better understood the operation of the system. "The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>," he wrote, "are much more crafty than the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   in their commerce and in everything, and always dupe them." He called the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   "sharp traders, [who] clean the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   out of everything they have in the way of guns, powder, ball, kettles, axes, knives, and awls." <a href="#n0412" id="ln0412" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> If the captains seriously entertained the notion that the villager-
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   link could be broken, they did not account for the trading abilities and needs of either party.</p>

Toward the end of October 1804, as the expedition passed the <span class="tei_name">Cannonball River</span>, the explorers began to notice abandoned <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. On October 19, the captains saw the ruins of a sturdy <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> settlement on a hill some ninety feet above the river. In the days that followed, as the American party passed through the old <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> homeland around the <span class="tei_name">Heart River</span>, there were even more signs of village life before the epidemic scourges of the 1780s and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> attacks forced a northward flight toward the <span class="tei_name">Knife</span>. A <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> sun dance post standing alone on the prairie was a silent witness to the past. Among the mounds and empty lodges of abandoned villages, the Americans found the scattered bones of both men and animals—grim reminders of the devastation of earlier days. <a href="#n0413" id="ln0413" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Faced with these unsettling artifacts of a troubled past, there must have been a certain measure of relief among the explorers when, on October 24, they encountered the first live <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Indians seen by the expedition. As the captains passed an island in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, they came upon a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief on a fall hunt. Because one of their central diplomatic objectives was to promote an alliance of all <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were anxious to foster peace between the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>, and the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. The captains were sure they had moved one step closer to that goal when the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief and the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief traveling with them met "with great Cordiallity and serimony." After smoking a pipe together, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and Gravelines went with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief to his lodge. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the group returned, "We admitted the Grand Chief and his brother for a few minits on our boat." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> added his unofficial seal of approval to the day by observing that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   "had Some handsome women with them." As the expedition camped that night below an old <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> town, all signs pointed toward friendly relations on several levels. <a href="#n0414" id="ln0414" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Expeditionary diplomacy, as well as personal expectations about those "handsome women," was slowed the next day as progress upriver became more difficult. As the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> twisted its way north beyond present-day <span class="tei_name">Bismarck</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, its channel became choked with sandbars and hard to find. While the men struggled throughout the day with the heavy keelboat, more and more 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   came to the riverbank to watch what must have seemed an outlandish spectacle. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   as sightseers intent on "satisfying their Curiossities as to our appearance, etc." As the day wore on, knots of Indians called the Americans to come ashore and talk. The demands of the river gave little time for such rest stops, but <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did take note of more vacant <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages and "a large and extensive bottom for several miles in which the squars raised their corn." Sometime during the day the captains also heard a bit of news that further verified their bad opinion of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  . 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors had recently stolen some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> horses and on the way home from the raid had fallen in with an 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   band. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   had been killed by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  , an incident reenforcing the image of plains nomads as hostile and unpredictable. When several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   came to camp, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had his first opportunity to study the villagers. His first impressions were favorable and he wrote, "Those Indians appear to have similar customs with the <span class="tei_name">Ricaras</span>, they dress the same, [and are] more mile in their language and justurs." <a href="#n0415" id="ln0415" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> flotilla neared the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages, the pace of the expedition's activity increased. There were all sorts of problems that called for the captains' attention and most of those questions involved relations with the Indians. The Americans needed to prepare for full-scale talks with <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs, a prospect that required careful thought, reliable interpreters, and plenty of gifts. The delicate truce proposed between the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> had to be accepted by the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> chiefs and perhaps solidified with some cooperative show of force against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . And there was the presence of Canadian and English traders on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. These men, none of whom were American citizens, posed a unique challenge to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> Indian diplomacy. Were they to be allowed to continue trading with the Indians, thereby undercutting <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> ventures, or were they to be expelled, perhaps with a show of force? In the confused days immediately after the Louisiana Purchase, the status of those foreign traders was unclear. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would have to tread carefully, watching the words and actions of both Indians and traders, gathering valuable information but alienating no one. American sovereignty had to be proclaimed but not so stridently as to frighten Indian trading partners. Finally, and of no little concern, a suitable location for winter quarters had to be found.</p>
               <p>
Plans to resolve those questions began to take shape on the evening of October 26, when the Americans camped in a fallow cornfield just below <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. Earlier in the day, the captains had accepted two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs and their household goods as temporary keelboat passengers. Now as the whole party made camp, they were joined by scores of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> men, women and children who clustered around the expedition's gear. Poking and probing all the strange objects, the Indians seemed especially attracted to the corn mill. Because <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was still suffering from a persistent rheumatic complaint and both men were unsure of their reception by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> alone joined the chiefs in making the short walk to <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. Fears of an unfriendly reception were quickly allayed when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was given a warm welcome. <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> cryptic "found the nation very friendly" masks the real concern the expedition had about relations with the villagers. At this early stage perhaps neither the chiefs nor the captains were quite ready to pass final judgment on each other. But it was an encouraging sign of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> friendship when the chiefs came back to the expedition's camp later in the evening and smoked with <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <a href="#n0416" id="ln0416" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
That first evening of talking and smoking was important preparation for the days to come but it was, after all, only the beginning. Contact had been made with only one <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village. With much left to do, the expedition continued to make measured progress upriver on the following day. Saturday proved to be a day filled with informal visits to both <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, considerable socializing, and an important meeting with the trader <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span>.</p>
               <p>
Leaving camp early on Saturday morning, the expedition made its first stop at <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hiked up the fifty-foot terrace to the stockaded town, noting as he went the earth lodges with many horses tethered outside. Once in the village, the explorer was greeted by several chiefs. Although <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not record which chiefs were present, it is most likely that he met <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and perhaps <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>, the Second Chief. After smoking, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was invited to remain at the village for some food. Anxious to impress their powerful visitor and perhaps make a valuable trade connection, the <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> chiefs were very displeased when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> rejected their offer of corn and beans. That displeasure was eventually dispelled when the captain explained that he felt "indisposed" and was not prepared to take on the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> menu.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps the most important event during the two-hour visit at <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> was the meeting with <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span>. A free trader with ties to the North West Company, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> had been living among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   for some fifteen years and spoke their language fluently. Few whites could match <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume's</span> knowledge and experience on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Many fellow traders did not like the Frenchman, including <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span>, who described him as a man whose ways were "much worse than those of a <span class="tei_name">Mandane</span>." The dour <span class="tei_name">Henry</span> asserted that <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> was "possessed of every superstition natural to those people, nor is he different in every mean, dirty trick they have acquired from intercourse with the set of scoundrels who visit these parts." Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were eager to hire <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> as an interpreter and informant on Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> life, they had an equally low opinion of him. Later that evening, after <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> told <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that he had once served the elder <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as a scout in the <span class="tei_name">Illinois</span> country during the Revolution, the explorer described him as "a cunin artful an insonce [insolent] ar—[?]." <a href="#n0417" id="ln0417" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
His visit at <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> over, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned to the river. As the expedition passed the Nuptadi village called <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>, the banks were lined with <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> children intent on not missing a single move made by the white strangers. Opposite the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> village of <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>, the keelboat and pirogues were anchored and camp was established. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> then took an interpreter, perhaps Jusseaume, and paid a courtesy call at <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>. Most of the men who were out hunting had now returned, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spent an hour talking with the village leaders <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and <span class="tei_name">Raven Man Chief</span>.</p>
               <p>
With the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages all properly visited, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> now turned their attention to preparing for the important council planned for October 28. The three <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages had not yet been invited, and it was imperative that they be part of any negotiations. The captains selected three runners, perhaps young <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> warriors, to carry carrots of tobacco to the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns to symbolize the Americans' cordial wish to talk. Erecting a flag pole, checking the supply of gifts, and sending invitations were only part of the preparations made that night. There was the pressing matter of political intelligence. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> needed to know the names of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs and prominent men, as well as something of the way they might respond to the proposals offered by the captains. For all their dislike of <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, it was to him that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> turned for "some information of the chiefs of the different nations." <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume's</span> thorough knowledge of village politics is reflected in the complete list of Indian notables <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> composed on October 29. With all these matters in hand, the expedition welcomed overnight <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> visitors and bedded down for another night along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. <a href="#n0418" id="ln0418" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The grand council bringing together <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>, and United States representatives was to take place on Sunday, October 28, 1804. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> described the level flood plain across the river from <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span> as "the most convenient place to hold a council with the whole nation." By midmorning <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> representing all three villages began to gather at the conference ground. Everything seemed in order before noon except the weather. Just as high winds had delayed talks with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, so now a strong gale from the Southwest turned the captains' plans upside down. Blowing sand picked up by the fierce wind stung everyone's face, and the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> became so rough that <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and the other <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> chiefs could not cross to the meeting site.</p>
               <p>
Their plans gone awry, the captains spent the day entertaining the chiefs who were already there. Tours of the keelboat were conducted for the visiting dignitaries, who promptly pronounced it and <span class="tei_name">York</span> to be "great medicine." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, and an interpreter then walked about a mile and a half up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> looking for a good location for the future <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Although many places seemed promising, all lacked sufficient supplies of timber. The captains also used their time with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief to ask him about leadership in the five villages. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, whom <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came to rely on more and more during the winter, provided the names of twelve prominent chiefs to flesh out the information obtained from <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>. There was also time for some friendly gift giving. Several women brought corn and boiled hominy; <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> responded by offering a large glazed earthenware jar to <span class="tei_name">Black Cat's</span> wife, "who receved it with much pleasure." Other members of the expedition indulged in some sightseeing. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> poked around <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>, noting the design of the village and marveling at the way <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> corpses were arranged on scaffolds outside the town. <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>, who had caught two beavers the night before, probably did some more pelt hunting. <a href="#n0419" id="ln0419" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Hoping that the weather on Monday would be more favorable, the explorers again made their diplomatic arrangements. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs were asked to smoke with <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and remain in his village until the next day. Despite these delays, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were confident that they could persuade the Indian delegates to accept what might be called "the American Plan."</p>
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> entered the crucial talks, they had several objectives in mind. Some were the same as those pursued in meetings with Indians lower down the river while others were unique to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> situation on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Of the goals that represented a continuity with earlier Indian conferences, two must have seemed especially important to the explorer-diplomats that Sunday evening. First, there was the vital matter of announcing American sovereignty over lands of the Louisiana Purchase. As they had done before, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were anxious to impress on the minds of "dutiful Indian children" that they had a new and powerful father in a distant place. But sovereignty meant more than simply proclaiming <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span> as the new Indian father. If American influence was to be substance and not shadow, men like <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> had to be made willing agents of United States policy. The second goal was closely tied to the first. American policy toward the Indians linked trade with sovereignty. Proclaiming ownership of new territories meant little unless some economic good would come from them. Everything that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had seen so far indicated the rich possibilities for <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>-based traders. That trade could serve many purposes. Strengthening American influence while reducing the power of British agents was not the least of the captains' concerns. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never thought that trade followed the flag. They assumed that sovereignty and business enterprise marched as one.</p>
               <p>
Commerce and nationalism were certainly important objectives to be pursued in the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> talks. But what now captured most of the captains' attention was a plan whose outlines had been forming from the earliest days of the expedition. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw it, the various 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands, but especially the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>, were the most dangerous and disruptive force on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. After spending some time on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the explorers were ready to add the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   to the list of hostile tribes. For <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the response to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   challenge was the creation of a villager alliance against the plains nomads. Such an alliance would strengthen, so thought the captains, the power of the earth lodge people so that they could more fully participate in the American trade system. At the same time, such an alliance might force the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   to abandon their British suppliers and join the American traders. The vital first step in forging such a villager alliance had been taken when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> convinced some <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs to make peace with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns. As the captains entered the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> conference, they still believed that a few words, a bit of military pomp, and some gifts could rearrange tribal politics to suit American interests.</p>
               <p>
The weather on the morning of October 29 did not bode well for the sort of meeting the explorers had in mind. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote, "The winds was so hard that it was extreemely disagreeable, the Sands was blown on us in clouds." <a href="#n0420" id="ln0420" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Fearing that further delays might permanently damage their prospects for success, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided to proceed with the gathering. To shield the participants from the nasty weather, the captains ordered an awning put up and pieces of sail cloth stretched between stakes to block the wind and flying sand.</p>
               <p>
By midmorning all seemed in order, and at eleven o'clock the bow swivel gun on the keelboat was fired to signal the start of the meeting. Expeditionary records do not make it clear how many <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs were present. It is certain that <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span>, the powerful <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>-proper chief, was not present, nor was <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>. Those who did attend included <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and the important <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>-proper chief <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> began the session by giving a long speech interpreted through <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, "the Substance of which [was] Similer to what we had Delivered to the nations below." That stock speech stressed the themes of United States sovereignty, American trade, and intertribal peace. Such proposals did not seem novel to the captains, but they did amount to substantial changes in the ways the five <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages did business with both native and white outsiders. Even before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> introduced the touchy matter of peace with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and a villager alliance against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , there were signs of displeasure. The most visible one came from <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span>. Although he had given up much formal power to <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span>, <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span> retained considerable influence among the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>-proper. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spoke, the chief became increasingly restless and finally seemed ready to leave the council. When questioned, <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span> excused his unhappy reaction to the American proposals by claiming that his village stood in imminent danger of attack from unnamed but hostile Indians. One of the chiefs quickly saw through this deception and "rebuked [<span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span>] for his uneasiness at Such a time as the present." <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota's</span> "uneasiness" was probably a reflection of the close ties <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span> and the other <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages had to English traders, as well as a dislike for outsiders who dared dictate policy to the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. But at this point in the proceedings <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota's</span> actions did not seem worrisome and the captains had no reason to think that there would be serious <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> opposition to any part of the American design.</p>
               <p>
At the end of the speech, the captains introduced the most controversial element on their diplomatic agenda. The assembled Indians must have known that the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief sitting in the council was more than window dressing. Now was the time to open the issue of an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> as a preliminary to a general villager coalition. The captains did not record the words they used to propose the peace treaty, but what does survive is evidence of a significant gesture. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, by now acquainted with the protocol of plains diplomacy, took a pipe, smoked it and passed it to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief. That pipe was in turn handed around to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> representatives. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted later, "They all smoked with eagerness out of the pipe held by the <span class="tei_name">Ricara</span> chief." <a href="#n0421" id="ln0421" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> To demonstrate the importance of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief and to enhance his status among the other chiefs, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gave him an American dollar coin as a medal, "with which he was much pleased," as well as a certificate verifying his "sincereity and good conduct."</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not know until much later that the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> had privately blasted the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> as "liars and bad men." Speaking directly to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief sometime after the council, <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> accused the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villagers of treachery in killing <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> representatives who had earlier sought peace. Whenever there was conflict between the Mandans and the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief insisted that the instigators were always the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. But <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> boasted that in those violent encounters <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> warriors killed the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> "like the buffalo." With a candor not shown to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> said to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief, "We will make peace with you as our two fathers have directed, and they shall see that we will not be the Ogressors, but we fear the <span class="tei_name">Ricares</span> will not be at peace long." <a href="#n0422" id="ln0422" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not hear about the acrimonious exchange until the end of November. Had they known about <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> reservations earlier, the American diplomats might not have been so sanguine in their expectations.</p>
               <p>
Relieved that the peace overture had evidently been well received, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> moved on to the next item—designating chiefs and distributing gifts. As they had done before, the captains were determined to "mint" chiefs whether the American stamp meant anything or not. Indians accepted the uniforms, medals, certificates, and flags as symbols of respect but had no intention of relinquishing political autonomy or cultural identity. Appointing men like <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> or <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> was essentially a meaningless exercise, but it fulfilled bureaucratic imperative. "With much serimony," the expedition handed out medals, coats, hats, flags, and other goods to those selected to receive American honors. Knowing that <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> was too important to be overlooked even though he was out hunting, the captains gave <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span> a suit of clothes for the chief. For the old <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>-proper chief himself, there was a supply of gifts, a flag, and some wampum. Because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew so little about the politics of <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> and <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, they named no chiefs for those villages but simply listed a number of prominent warriors for the expedition's record. Unlike other earlier Indian conferences that ended with a general distribution of gifts to natives of all sorts and ranks, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> limited their presents to the chiefs and elders. That action caused considerable resentment, since most Indians persisted in viewing the expedition as a trading venture.</p>
               <p>
With the conference nearly over, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> asked the Indians for their replies as soon as possible. The proceedings ended as they began with a display of American firepower. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> fired his airgun, "which appeared to astonish the natives very much." The council concluded, most of the Indian participants drifted away, perhaps still wondering just what all the high-flown words and gifts really meant.</p>
               <p>
But for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the day was not yet over. Later that evening the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief came to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with an unwelcome request. The chief was beginning to feel uncomfortable in the company of so many recent enemies and wanted to return immediately to the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages. With negotiations on the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace still in progress, his departure could cause delay and suspicion. With a string of wampum and a promise that the talks would be successful, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was able to forestall the <span class="tei_name">Arikara's</span> departure. Having done that, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might have noted how busy the day had been. Indeed, it had been so filled with diplomatic comings and goings that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> forgot to wind the expedition's chronometer. <a href="#n0423" id="ln0423" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expected quick answers to the American proposals, they were to be disappointed. There was no <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> tribal council; each village had to spend considerable time formulating a response. There was a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> tribal council, created about 1797 or 1798, but each of the three villages retained virtual autonomy in dealings with powerful outsiders. <a href="#n0424" id="ln0424" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Despite their experience in earlier negotiations with the Indians, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> still assumed that they were dealing with nation states possessing bureaucratic machinery able to formulate and enforce a single response to a diplomatic proposal. In the three weeks that followed the grand council, the captains got not one answer but many. And they encountered more questions and hostility than expected.</p>
               <p>
On the day after the conference, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and Ohheenar, an adopted 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   living in <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>, came to the expedition's camp. Out hunting the day of the meeting, they were now eager to hear the speeches and share in the honors and gifts. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> offered the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs a synopsis of the American plan and ceremoniously placed a medal around <span class="tei_name">Sheheke's</span> neck. Knowing that they would have to wait a bit longer for responses to their plans, the captains divided the rest of the day between continuing the search for winter quarters and trading with the dozens of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   who were now becoming a regular part of camp life. From the camp opposite <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took eight men in a pirogue and sailed seven miles up toward the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>. On one of the islands in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, he found a good supply of wood but decided that the site was too distant from the water. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was beginning to think that a location lower down the river and closer to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages might prove the best choice. Throughout the afternoon the expedition's camp was filled with Indians eager to exchange corn and cornmeal bread for a variety of trade goods. The expedition needed to lay in a substantial store of food for the long winter. These trading days fulfilled that need while furthering good relations between the explorers and their neighbors. As the cool October afternoon slipped into evening, everyone danced and drank, "which pleased the Savages much." And in the twilight there was something else that pleased the captains. Into camp came the <span class="tei_name">Raven</span>, Second Chief at <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>, with an invitation from <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief wanted to talk, and he promised to give many bags of corn as a sign of good faith. The <span class="tei_name">Raven</span> also said that he was prepared to accompany the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief back to the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> to cement the villager alliance. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may not have known where to build <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, but at least it appeared winter diplomacy was well launched. <a href="#n0425" id="ln0425" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The last day of October 1804 marked the first of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa's</span> formal replies to the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> diplomatic offensive. Because the captains believed that <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> was the single most powerful <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief, they were anxious to know his response. About noon, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> walked down to <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>. At the village <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was welcomed "and with great ceremoney was Seeted on a roabe by the Side of the Chief." <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> placed a fine buffalo robe over <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> shoulders, "and after smoking the pipe with several old men around" <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> began to speak.</p>
               <p>
His speech was a carefully worded reply to the American proposals—a response designed to reassure <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> friendship without tying the villages too closely to an uncertain policy. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief went directly to the heart of the explorers' plan. Declaring that he believed what the captains said about an end to violence, <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> felt certain that a general peace would "not only give him Satisfaction but all his people." The chief graphically illustrated the benefits of such a peace, saying it would mean "they now could hunt without fear, and their womin could work in the fields without looking everry moment for the enemey." The idea of a general Indian peace was fundamental to American policy, but in the case of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villagers that peace had to be achieved among themselves before it could be widened to include others. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> seemed to indicate that was a real possibility. Pointing to the <span class="tei_name">Raven</span> and several warriors seated nearby, he indicated that these men would accompany the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief back to his village "to smoke with that people." Saying that the way was now open, <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> also showed some interest in going to see the Great Father in <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>.</p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> had things to say that pleased <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> also had complaints. Those complaints were based on the captains' inability to explain the nature of their mission. Previous Indian-white contact had always been within the context of trade. Indians of the region had yet to encounter white soldiers or bureaucrats. The very concept of exploration as an activity apart from war or trade simply made no sense to the Indians. As the expedition went upriver, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did give away substantial stocks of goods. The rumors that preceded the party stressed that display of wealth and raised expectations that many Indians might share in it. If the captains left behind among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> a vivid folklore, what went ahead were tales of cloth, beads, and ironware for all. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not immediately distribute gifts in the amounts expected after the first council, there was dissatisfaction. As <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> put it plainly, "When you came up the Indians in the neighboring Villages, as well as those out hunting when they heard of you had great expectations of receving presents. Those hunting immediately on hearing returned to the Village and all was Disapointed, and Some Dissatisfied." <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> admitted that he was pleased with his gifts but reported that most in <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> expected more.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief concluded his speech by restoring some stolen French beaver traps whose return had been requested earlier by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Two of the traps were laid at <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> feet, along with twelve bushels of corn and several buffalo robes. After more smoking "in great cerimony," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> replied to <span class="tei_name">Black Cat's</span> speech. The expedition's record does not contain any hint of what the captain said except that his words "Satisfied them verry much." If <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and his elders seemed "satisfied" with the meeting, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also had every reason to be pleased. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat's</span> village appeared ready to smoke in peace with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Complaints about not enough presents seemed inconsequential, and the chief's careful avoidance of criticism of either the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   or the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   did not disturb the confident captains.</p>
               <p>
On his way back to the keelboat, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> met <span class="tei_name">Tatuckcopinreha</span>, chief of <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Little Crow</span>, a prominent <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and second chief at <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> invited the two to join him on the boat, where they spent about an hour talking and smoking. Since this was the first official contact the expedition had had with any <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief since the grand council, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> probably hoped that <span class="tei_name">Tatuckcopinreha</span> would respond to at least part of the American proposal. Either the village council had not decided on its answer or the decision was to wait and see what the other villages would do, since all <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> got out of the <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span> chief were "a fiew words on various subjects not much to the purpose." After some more smoking and a quick airgun demonstration, the Indians left. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was plainly disappointed and peevishly wrote, "Those nations know nothing of regular councils and know not how to proceed in them, they are useless." <a href="#n0426" id="ln0426" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although the failure to get any clear statement from <span class="tei_name">Tatuckcopinreha</span> was unfortunate, this first day of gathering Indian reactions was successful from the captains' perspective. And the explorers' mood surely brightened later in the afternoon when <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and two of his sons came parading into camp to show off the fancy clothing given to them the previous day. In high spirits, <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> wanted to see the Americans dance to the music of <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte's</span> fiddle, a request "which they very readily gratified him in." The festive air in camp that night seemed a fitting end to a day in which the expedition edged closer to its diplomatic objectives. <a href="#n0427" id="ln0427" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The following day it was <span class="tei_name">Sheheke's</span> turn to speak with the captains. About ten o'clock the <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> chief, accompanied by <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> and Ohheenar, came into the expedition's camp. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> had two things on his mind, the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace and the future location of the expedition's winter quarters. The explorers were more interested in the <span class="tei_name">Mandan's</span> response to their proposals; he appeared far more concerned about the site of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. As it turned out, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> was the one who had his priorities in order, at least as far as <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> needs were concerned. But because the white strangers were so insistent, the chief began with words about peace and the Indian alliance. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> agreed to make peace with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and promised to send a delegation down to the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> to smoke with his new brothers. But the chief was not about to let <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> think that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   were in the past anything other than innocent victims of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> aggression. He maintained that conflict was always instigated by <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   forces. Some years before, a chief sent by the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages to smoke for peace had been murdered by the faithless <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Such acts fueled the continued violence and distrust, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> declared. He boasted, "We have killed enough of them. We kill them like birds." But at the same time, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> agreed that perhaps now was the time for a peace. Without making any long-range promises or binding the village to a potentially troublesome ally, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> simply said, "We will make a good peace."</p>
               <p>
Those were the words <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted to hear. The captains were intent on accomplishing their diplomatic assignments, and obtaining assurances from both <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs must have been satisfying. What continued to elude <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was the nature of Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> tribal and village relations. "A good peace" was not the same as a lasting one, nor was it intended to be. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> were not talking about a fundamental rearrangement of relations between villages or tribes. They certainly had no power to commit 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   to such changes. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> asked simply, "Are you going to stay above or below during this cold season?" The chief's solicitude for American comfort during the winter was more apparent than real. His real concern was to keep the expedition nearby for a regular supply of trade goods and for protection against Sioux raids. And there was the always troubled state of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> relations. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> wanted a <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, not a Fort Hidatsa. Having the Americans within the orbit of his village would enhance his prestige at the expense of his neighbors. All of this was couched in terms of available food for the winter, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> claiming that it would be easier to supply the expedition's needs if the fort was closer to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. The chief made this plain when he admitted, "We were sorry when we heard of your going up but now you are going down, we are glad." He had made his point, although the captains did not yet know how far the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   would go to keep <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> away from the fort. If the price for having the winter quarters nearby was seeming assent to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> diplomatic proposals, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> thought the cost low enough for gain received. <a href="#n0428" id="ln0428" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In the days that followed, the diplomatic pace slowed. Dropping temperatures, hard frosts, and the first signs of ice on the river were all warnings of the impending plains winter. Indian negotiations now seemed less important than building warm shelter and laying in a good supply of meat and corn. <span class="tei_name">Joseph Whitehouse</span> summed up the expedition's activity in early November by writing that "all the men at Camp Ocepied their time dilligenently in Building their huts and got them Made comfertable in that time to live in." <a href="#n0429" id="ln0429" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> As <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> slowly took shape, other parts of the company's routine also feel into place. <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> brought his family into the American compound, thereby allowing quicker access to his interpreting skills. The daily visits of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> men and women bringing corn, beans, squash, and buffalo meat for trade now became not only a ritual of friendship but an important source of provisions. With the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief and a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> delegation having left for the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages on November 2, the captains had every reason to believe they had achieved both good relations with their native neighbors and the goals of Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian policy. That there were no <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs in the delegation and that the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages had not replied to the captains' proposals seemed relatively unimportant.</p>
               <p>
The predictable rhythm of those busy November days was broken by the arrival of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   to trade at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> reported that about fifty lodges of the Little Girl 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   were close at hand. Long before the La Vérendrye era, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   middlemen had made regular journeys to the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> to trade with the villagers. Their arrival signaled not only trade but some tension as well, since the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   often tried to enhance their own standing by stealing <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> horses. The coming of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   was of special interest to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Just as the tributaries of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> might provide <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants access to the fur-rich region of the <span class="tei_name">Saskatchewan River</span>, contact with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   Indians might advance American trade prospects. The captains were always concerned with ways to undercut British traders, and although they distrusted the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  , they knew that northern Indians might play an important role in future American plans. If <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> view that the Louisiana Purchase included lands north of the 49th parallel proved valid, ties with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   would be essential.</p>
               <p>
By the middle of November, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> counted some seventy 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   lodges with a scattering of <span class="tei_name">Crees</span>. All were camped close by, busily preparing to trade with the village folk. Toward evening on November 13, most of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Crees</span> joined the villagers at one of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> towns for an adoption dance and ritual "giveaway." These ceremonies allowed customary enemies to become temporary fictional relatives and trade in peace. <a href="#n0430" id="ln0430" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Because the adoption idea might be used by Americans as a means to enter the intense competition for Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> trade, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were interested in recording and analyzing this aspect of plains culture.</p>
               <p>
Although the captains were eager to make contact with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  , they were unsure just how to proceed. That uncertainty was resolved when <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> obligingly brought the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   band chief <span class="tei_name">Chechank, or the Old Crane</span>, and seven "men of note" to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Eager to make a good impression on the visitors, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> offered <span class="tei_name">Chechank</span> a carrot of tobacco "to smoke with his people." Because the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   bands spent most of the year on British soil in what is now <span class="tei_name">Saskatchewan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Manitoba</span>, any official dealings with them would be both awkward and irregular. The captains certainly could not create chiefs, hand out medals and flags, or distribute substantial gifts to those Indians. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wisely made a gesture that steered clear of those dangers while still showing American interest and respect for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  . Taking a piece of gold braid, perhaps from a dress uniform, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gave it to <span class="tei_name">Chechank</span> "with a view to know him again." <a href="#n0431" id="ln0431" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The presence of the expedition and promises to bring American goods from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> had changed the villagers' feelings about the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  . As some 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   saw it, manufactured goods could be gotten from another source besides the troublesome 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   middlemen. This potential shift in economic strategy became plain on November 18 when <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> made a surprise appearance at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. The chief began his visit by tactfully making "great inquiries respecting our fashions." But it soon became clear that there was more on <span class="tei_name">Black Cat's</span> mind than curiosity about another culture. He revealed that on the previous night there had been a major <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> council involving chiefs and elders from both villages. In view of the fact that there was no <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> tribal council, nor even a clear concept of a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> tribe, such a meeting was an extraordinary event. The council session had centered on the problems posed by dealing with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  . Some in the council, taking seriously the offer of direct access to metal and textile goods from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, urged others to no longer trade with the northern Indians. However, that proposal was not well received by most at the assembly. Those who favored an immediate severing of old trade ties and a quick reliance on the Americans were forcefully reminded of lingering ill feelings over <span class="tei_name">John Evans's</span> treatment of them in 1796–97. These 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   claimed that <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> had deceived them and never fulfilled his promise to return and provide them with arms and ammunition. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, they said, might well do the same. Feelings such as these rightly worried the captains. If so many <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs and elders distrusted the Americans, the whole scheme of a villager alliance and a <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade system might be in jeopardy. But all <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could do was urge the Indians "to remain at peace" and assure them "they might depend upon Getting Supplies through the Channel of the <span class="tei_name">Missourie</span>, but it required time to put the trade in operation." <a href="#n0432" id="ln0432" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a> Such soothing words could not take the place of bales of trade goods, nor could they allay the fears expressed in the council. As the expedition settled in for the winter, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> doubts about American promises were a discordant note in a tune that had played well so far.</p>
               <p>
Two days later, on November 20, there was more unsettling news. No sooner had the captains been forced to confront <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> discontent than they heard about serious trouble between the Brulé 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Because the expedition's Indian policy depended on isolating the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and luring the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> into the American-sponsored coalition, anything that took place between those two Indian groups was of intense concern. Three chiefs from <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> reported that <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   camped above the <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span> were threatening to attack the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages during the winter. Even more ominous, the men said that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   had roughed up two <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace emissaries. Anxious to maintain their hold on the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were plainly "much displeased with the <span class="tei_name">Ricares</span> for making peace with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   etc. through us." <a href="#n0433" id="ln0433" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were now confronted with a set of grave diplomatic problems. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  ' acceptance of American economic leadership, seemingly so certain in late October, now appeared uncertain. The <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace mission had been disrupted by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   opposition and now there were open threats of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> raids during the winter. The entire <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Indian strategy rested on peace between the tribes and a growing acceptance of the villager alliance. It now became plain that the coalition was more imaginary than real. <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> discontent, possible <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> defection, and the danger of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   assaults all pointed to yet another nagging and unresolved problem. Since the last days of October, the captains had had no official contact with the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. Those villages had never replied to the American proposals, nor had they taken any substantial part in the delegation sent to negotiate with the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns. As these problems began to flood in on the captains, it was essential that talks be opened with leaders at <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> and <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>.</p>
               <p>
Those talks began on November 25, when <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span> rode from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. Six additional members of the expedition took one of the pirogues up to the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>. Their destination was <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, largest and most powerful of the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> settlements. For reasons that are not clear, the American party went directly to the lodge of a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief named the <span class="tei_name">Serpent</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> seemed especially interested in talking with another chief named the <span class="tei_name">Horned Weasel</span>. Oddly, there is no record of any attempt to talk with either <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> or <span class="tei_name">Caltarcota</span>. <span class="tei_name">Charles Mackenzie</span>, a North West Company trader living in <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span>, was told by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that when the Americans attempted to talk with the <span class="tei_name">Horned Weasel</span> they were politely but forcefully rebuffed. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief let it be known that he was "not at home." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted to <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> that "this conduct surprised me, it being common only among your English Lords, not to be 'at home' when they did not wish to see strangers." <a href="#n0434" id="ln0434" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the rest of the American party did manage to find lodging that night, they were not given the chance to present American views to any <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span> chiefs.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> did not know that while he was being cold-shouldered in <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was in the midst of entertaining at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> some of the very men <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wanted to meet. Sometime during the day of the 25th, with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and all the interpreters away from the fort, two <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs, one of them <span class="tei_name">Waukeressara</span>, appeared at the expedition's quarters. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recognized the significance of the visit, noting that the chiefs were "the first of that Nation who has Visited us Since we have been here." Handicapped by the absence of the interpreters and anxious to pay "a perticular attention" to the visitors, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was reduced to handing out some paint, a piece of lace, a handkerchief, and "some other few articles" in hopes of making a favorable impression. The captain believed that the gifts "pleased them very much" but it would take more than an assortment of presents to change <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> attitudes. <a href="#n0435" id="ln0435" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Unaware of the events at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> and feeling rejected by the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>-proper in <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> rode over to the <span class="tei_name">Awatixa Hidatsa</span> village on the morning of November 26. Perhaps the American diplomat hoped that among <span class="tei_name">Black Moccasin's</span> people he might gain a more sympathetic hearing. Sometime during the day, after complaining to <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> about his unpleasant experiences in <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> convened a council of the <span class="tei_name">Awatixa</span> chiefs. Just who attended this meeting in <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> is not clear since the only account is from a sketchy narrative written by <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>. Certainly there were <span class="tei_name">Awatixa Hidatsas</span> present, and it is possible that some curious <span class="tei_name">Hidatas</span>-proper also showed up. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> began the proceedings by trying to explain the nature and purpose of the American presence. There had been confusion on this point, and the diplomat was eager to clarify the objective of the party as exploration, not trade. But this was a minor point, or so it seemed to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Mainly, he promoted the twin themes of American policy toward the Indians on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>: peace among the tribes and a villager alliance. To emphasize United States sovereignty and good will, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> distributed clothing, medals, and flags. Although some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> took the gifts, others made a show of rejecting them. At this point several of the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> gave voice to their feelings, declaring that no matter how many presents were offered, they "could not be reconciled to like these 'strangers' as they called them." The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs then complained that "had these Whites come amongst us with charitable views they would have loaded their 'Great Boat' with necessaries. It is true they have ammunition, but they prefer throwing it away idly than sparing a shot of it to a poor <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>."</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> response to these complaints was oddly inappropriate. Unlimbering his airgun, he gave a quick demonstration of its accuracy and fire power. The assembled Indians were certainly impressed with the weapon and "dreaded the magic of its owners," but <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had hardly quieted their fears. Nor had he gained any converts for the American gospel. The complaints continued, and at last one <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief boasted that if his young warriors ever caught the Americans on the plains they would share the fate of hunted wolves. Unimpressed with either the expedition's weaponry or <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> diplomacy, the same chief insisted that there were only two sensible men in the entire American expedition, "the worker of iron and the mender of guns."</p>
               <p>
Despite these allegations and veiled threats, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> may well have thought his mission was at least partially successful. The explorer extracted a promise from some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs not to wage war on distant peoples such as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>. But such a promise was hardly binding, and no sooner had <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> let <span class="tei_name">Metaharta</span> than the chief of the Wolves, a society of young warriors, took a party of fifty to raid the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also may have thought he had made some diplomatic progress because two <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs, <span class="tei_name">Marnohtoh</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mannessurree</span>, agreed to return with him to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> for further talks. <a href="#n0436" id="ln0436" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>

Once back at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, there were more talks and now some of the sources for <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> distrust of the expedition were revealed. The chiefs unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and poorly concealed abuse on the captains. The first part of that torrent concerned rumors spread by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and designed to keep the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> from coming to trade at the fort. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs claimed the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   had told them that the Americans were in league with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and were preparing a secret winter attack. This rumor was added to another <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-inspired tale which insisted that any <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> who went to the expedition's quarters would be killed by the explorers. These rumors gained weight among the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villagers as they witnessed a number of events for which there seemed no explanation except a sinister one. When <span class="tei_name">René Jusseaume</span> moved his family into <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, many <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> saw this as a sign of a coming attack. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> were further worried by the sheer size of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> and its well-armed occupants. A number of chiefs were offended also at what they called "the high-sounding language the American captains bestowed upon themselves and their nation, wishing to impress the Indians with an idea that they were great warriors, and a powerful people, who, if exasperated, could crush all the nations of the earth." As <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span> later explained, such saber rattling did not set well with the proud <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>.</p>
               <p>
Rumor, misunderstanding, and a dash of American swagger were not the only things that had alienated the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. There was the matter of economic ties with British traders and what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed to be illegal political activity by North West Company agents. The captains knew long before they got to the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> that they would encounter British citizens working for the two great trading companies. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> understood it, American policy was to allow such business activity by foreign nationals to continue so long as it did not threaten federal sovereignty. The explorers had made it plain in their earliest meetings with <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> and <span class="tei_name">François Antoine Larocque</span> that North West Company agents would not be forced out of the new lands of the Louisiana Purchase as long as they did not distribute any symbols of political authority such as flags and medals. After listening to the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas'</span> charges, the captains were convinced that <span class="tei_name">Jean Baptiste La France</span>, a North West Company clerk working for <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>, was speaking "unfavorably" among the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> about American actions and intentions. There is no doubt that the Indian villagers felt close enough to the British traders to exclude American economic overtures. They did not need someone like La <span class="tei_name">France</span> to remind them of the important role played by both the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> himself made his preferences known in a conversation with <span class="tei_name">Charles Mackenzie</span>. The chief "said a great deal in favor of the [North West] Company, but he did not praise the Americans."</p>
               <p>
And there was one final sentiment voiced by the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> at the end of November. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that an Indian policy promoting peace between the tribes was both humane and rational. Many younger <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> warriors did not share that view. They explained that forswearing raids on enemies would leave unavenged the deaths of relatives. More important, without the status gained by deeds of valor there would be no way to select village leaders. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> recorded one young warrior's concern that "if they were in a state of peace with all their neighbors what would the nation do for chiefs?" This man saw the unfortunate cultural consequences of peace, explaining that "the chiefs were now old and must shortly die and that the nation could not exist without chiefs."</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may well have been overwhelmed by both the vehemence and the number of <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> grievances. Just how <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> answered them is not recorded in the expedition journals. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> only noted with forced optimism that "all those reports was contredicted by <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> with a conviction on the minds of the Indians of the falsity of those reports." But little had really changed. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> were no more prepared to become part of the American grand design than before. All the concerns that had forced <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> mission were still unresolved. In fact, now that the captains knew just how much tension there was between the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> as well as what many <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> thought about the expedition, there may have been more reason to fear for the future. <a href="#n0437" id="ln0437" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Determined to do whatever they could to preserve a policy toward the Indians that now seemed on the verge of complete collapse, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and  decided to call in the Nor'Wester <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> for a severe tongue-lashing. Unable to change Indian realities, the captains evidently fixed on the Nor'Westers as the source of the expedition's difficulties. Although <span class="tei_name">La France</span> had probably done all he could to keep the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> loyal to their North West Company partners and <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> had sometimes made a nuisance of himself in pressing his request to accompany the Americans to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had no real evidence to suggest that British traders were inciting opposition to American authority. Nonetheless, on November 28 the captains met with <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and other <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs for "a little talk on the Subject of the British Trader <span class="tei_name">M. Le rock</span> Giveing meadals and Flags." The chiefs were told that if they accepted such gifts they would "incur the displeasure of their Great American Father." <a href="#n0438" id="ln0438" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
With the Indians properly warned, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> turned directly to <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span>. On the following day the trader and one of his men came to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> just as a soldier in the expedition was setting out to summon him. <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> was treated well enough; in fact, relations between the traders and the explorers were to remain genial during most of the winter. There was a good deal of mutual visiting between the two groups and the captains found men like <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hugh Heney</span> to be valuable sources of information on a wide variety of subjects. But now the tension of the past several weeks began to show as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> accused <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> of intending to distribute medals and flags. He quickly replied that, in failing to carry such objects with him, he "ran no risk of disobeying" their orders. Apparently put off by that disclaimer, the captains then brought <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> into the discussion. <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, with the expedition's permission, had been working part-time for <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> in the trade with the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> was "strictly enjoined not to utter a word to the Indians which might in any way be to the prejudice of the United States, or any of its citizens," even if <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> ordered him to do so. Turning to <span class="tei_name">Larcoque</span>, one of the captains added sarcastically, "Which we are very far from thinking you would." The air temporarily cleared, the explorers and traders spent a pleasant evening at the fort. <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> was told about American trade policy on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and the extension of the factory system into the region. "In short," recalled <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span>, "during the time I was there a very grand plan was schemed, but its being realized is more than I can tell, although the Captains say they are well assured it will." <a href="#n0439" id="ln0439" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Nothing of substance had changed. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have felt confident about <span class="tei_name">Larocque's</span> "fair promises," but the fundamental problems undermining that "very grand plan" were no nearer resolution. All the fears and concerns that drove <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to make his ill-fated journey to the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns had not gone away. Like virtually all white diplomats on the North American frontier, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found it difficult to believe that they could not easily rearrange Indian realities to serve non-Indian interests. The captains were not the masters of Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian affairs. They were simply players in a complex game made more intricate by their very presence. Just how helpless the expedition was to shape native actions became painfully clear at the end of November.</p>
               <p>
Friday morning, November 30, seemed like the beginning of any other routine day at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. There had been a hard frost overnight and now hut fires were stoked up to beat back the cold. At eight o'clock the quiet was broken by a voice shouting from the other side of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. A <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> called for a pirogue to ferry him across the river, explaining he had "something of consequence to communicate." Once in the fort, the Indian presented the captains with news that alarmed them and at the same time offered a unique opportunity for the expedition to flex its military muscle. He explained that five <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> hunters had been surprised and attacked by a party of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> warriors. In the struggle that followed one villager was killed, two were wounded, and nine horses were stolen. There had also been trouble between the raiders and hunters from <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>. Four <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> from that village were missing and rumors were flying of an imminent 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> attack.</p>
               <p>
Although news of a joint 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> raiding party had obvious implications for the future of a villager alliance, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> felt that the first order of business was a firm demonstration of American force to punish those who had attacked the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . Where words had failed, the explorers were now ready to use military action. "We thought it well," explained <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, "to Show a Disposition to ade and assist them against their enemies, perticularly those who Came in oppersition to our Councels." After a hurried discussion, the captains organized a large armed party of soldiers from the fort. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expected to swell their own ranks by obtaining volunteers from <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>, <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Mahawha</span>.</p>
               <p>
By midmorning <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had his men ready for action. The putative expedition consisted of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, and about twenty soldiers. Crossing the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the group headed for the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village of <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. Once across the river, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrayed his troops in battle formation with men out on each flank and a covering rear guard. <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Ordway</span>, who was on the left flank, recalled later that heavy brush matted down with snow made the march slow and difficult. Finally making their way out of the river bottom, the Americans broke onto the level plain behind <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had planned the show of force as a means to impress and reassure the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . But his unannounced arrival had just the opposite effect. "The Indians not expected to receive Such Strong aide in So Short a time was much surprised, and a little allarmed at the formadable appearence of my party." When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men were about two hundred yards from the village, a very worried <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> and several other chiefs came out and nervously invited the Americans into the town. While the soldiers went into several lodges to rest and warm up, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tried to explain the nature of his mission. Hoping to calm the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  ' fears, the captain declared that he and his men were there to "chastise the enemies of our Dutifull Chieldren." Turning to <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, who was evidently in <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> or other business, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> asked him to verify the assault on the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> hunters. This done, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> then recommended that war parties from both <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages join the American forces "to meet the Army of <span class="tei_name">Souex</span> and chastise them for taking the blood of our Dutiful Children."</p>
               <p>
If the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs were alarmed by the arrival of heavily armed soldiers, they were astounded at <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> proposal. For a large <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-American force to venture out in the cold and snow in search of an elusive <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   party made no sense to the chiefs. They had taken the attack as just one more in a long series of episode between the nomads and the villagers. The dead man could be avenged in the spring. Clearly the chiefs found the American suggestions both puzzling and disturbing. After a brief talk among themselves, <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> explained that all the villagers were impressed with the readiness of the Americans to defend them. Trying to accept some of the blame for the attack and thereby defuse the situation, the chief said that his people "carelessly went out to hunt in small parties believing themselves to be safe from the other nations." Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tended to portray the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> as the instigators in this and other attacks, <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> saved his harshest words for the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Recalling the discussion of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> truce at the meetings in late October, <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> revealed for the first time his harsh words directed at the visiting Indian diplomat. "I knew," insisted the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief, "that the <span class="tei_name">Panies</span> [<span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>] were liers, and told the old Chief who Came with you (to Confirm a peace with us) that his people were liers and bad men and that we killed them like the Buffalo, when we pleased." <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> again expressed the common <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> view that any peace with the aggressive <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> was bound to be unstable. He added that two <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> men who had been in <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> at the time of the raid were sent packing by the chiefs for fear that revenge might be taken on them. According to <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span>, those visitors reported that two of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns "were making their Mockersons," a sure sign of preparation for war, and that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   "had best take care of [their] horses." <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> admitted that there were some <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> warriors in the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages who were "not well disposed towards us," but the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief felt certain the real blame rested with the troublesome <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Even so, the prospect of rushing out to "chastise" the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> in the dead of a <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> winter had little appeal to any of the villagers. "My father," said <span class="tei_name">Big Man</span>, "the Snow is deep and it is cold, our horses Cannot travel through the plains, those people who have spilt our blood have gone back." Not wanting to seem ungrateful in the face of American support—support the Indians were not sure they really wanted—<span class="tei_name">Big Man</span> offered the alternative of a joint war party when spring came.</p>
               <p>
By now <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have realized that an attack on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> raiders with <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> support was not to be. His enthusiasm for fighting dampened by <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> reluctance and the simple passage of time in a warm lodge, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> used the remaining hours for more diplomatic talk. Once again he emphasized the readiness of American forces to defend friendly Indians against any enemy and urged the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   to report the presence of hostile warriors directly to the captains. Substituting tough words for strong action, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> boasted that he "wished to meet those <span class="tei_name">Seeoux</span> and all others who will not open their ears, but make war on our dutiful Children." The captain had made his point about the use of force. He now knew that rumors about <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> faithlessness were being treated as truth by <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs. Allowed to go unchallenged, such sentiments could destroy any hope for the villager alliance. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> cautioned the chiefs against indicting all <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> for what he termed the actions of a few "bad men." "Do not get mad with the <span class="tei_name">recarees</span>," he counseled, "until we [know] if those bad men are countenanced by their nation, and we are convinced those people do not intend to follow our Councils." Returning to his understanding of the economic relationship between the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tried to make a case for the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> leading the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> "astray." He also used the opportunity to remind the chiefs that just as the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were forced to accept 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   domination, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   had to swallow 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   insults rather than risk war with the northern Indians and a possible interruption of trade goods from <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>.</p>
               <p>
Talks went on for some time until coming darkness made <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decide to return to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. The journey back in failing light and deep snow proved to be "verry fatigueing." To boost their spirits once inside the fort, each man was given an extra liquor ration. But for the captains even extra spirits could not change the fact that their venture into gunboat diplomacy had proved a dismal failure and something of an embarrassment. <a href="#n0440" id="ln0440" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The day must have been an unsettling climax to a troubled month. At the end of October, with the initial <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> councils finished, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had believed they were well on the way to achieving their Indian policy goals. Then the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace seemed assured and unity among the village peoples appeared probable. But events throughout November challenged those assumptions. The captains' best efforts to salvage something of their plans failed. Their response to the attack on the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> hunters was symbolic of how little white outsiders could alter Indian realities. Held prisoner by their own political and cultural values, the captains were determined to use the incident as an excuse for the display of their military might and, with some luck, to strike a blow against the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . Differing perspectives on warfare and diplomacy meant that the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs found the American desire for winter revenge at best baffling and at worst stupid. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> unhappy <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> foray could now be matched by an equally fruitless <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> journey into the complicated Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian world.</p>
               <p>
As the snow and cold of a <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> December closed in, the captains found more of their time taken up with the demands of food, warm clothing, and reliable fires. They had no intention of ignoring the uneasy state of Indian affairs around them, but travel conditions and lack of sufficient information narrowed their options and limited what actions could be taken. Believing that the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs had been both impressed and reassured, they had only to discover the current state of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   relations. In the first week of December the explorers sent a letter to the traders <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>, who were at the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages, pleading for news. But it was more than simple news gathering that the explorers wanted from the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> men. They asked the traders "to interseed in preventing hostilities." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted both the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   to be warned of "what part we intend to take" if either group broke the peace. Lacking any real power to back up such threats, the captains probably hoped the personal influence of the traders would carry the day. <a href="#n0441" id="ln0441" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>

The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter was neither all high diplomacy nor a nerve-racking round of alarms and confusions. Most of the five months spent at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> were taken up with demands for food and shelter. Explorers and Indians got to know each other in ways that had little to do with federal policy or grand councils. Visiting, hunting, trading, and sexual adventures were all common ground where people from different cultures could talk, joke, haggle, and compete in the shared struggle for life on the northern plains.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> was no isolated frontier outpost, caught in the grip of a <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> winter and cut off from the simple pleasures of human companionship. Long before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came to the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villagers had brightened their winters with a steady round of visits to the lodges of friends and neighbors. Life in the winter camps could be harsh and hungry, but there also were times for storytelling and gossip. Once <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> was built, the Americans simply became part of that social web that bound the villagers together. Nothing seemed more natural than the desire of explorer and Indian alike to see each other at home and share some food and friendship.</p>
               <p>
From the moment the expedition reached its winter quarters, Indian visitors came in a steady stream. Fascinated by the "great boat," the endless variety of curious objects, and the Americans themselves, village men, women, and especially children, could not get enough close looks at the bearded strangers. Although some Indians came to trade, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> remarked later in the winter that most were "lookers on" simply attracted by the presence of the expedition. <a href="#n0442" id="ln0442" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> By the end of the councils in late October, any initial reserve each group had about the other was gone. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned on October 30 from a trip upriver looking for a suitable fort location, he found his men gaily dancing sets and reels, "which pleased the savages much." <a href="#n0443" id="ln0443" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Once the expedition's workmen began to build <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, there was even more reason for Indians to come down and watch the construction of a great lodge the size and shape of which they had never seen. Just how much good-natured banter was possible between Indian onlookers and American workers is not part of the expedition's record, but throughout November there was hardly a day in which numbers of Indians did not come to inspect the construction. <a href="#n0444" id="ln0444" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a> By the end of the month, as the fort took shape, it was possible for the explorers to invite selected Indian visitors—usually chiefs, elders, and their families—into their rooms. On November 20, for example, three chiefs from <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span> paid a visit, stayed all day, and were "verry Curious in examining our works." <a href="#n0445" id="ln0445" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Indians were drawn not only to the fort itself but to the many "curiosities" they found inside. It had long been the expedition's practice to display all sorts of weapons and scientific instruments to Indians in an effort to impress them with American technology. When <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> and other <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> came to the fort in early March 1805, they were shown everything from <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> airgun to his spyglass. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> promptly proclaimed these devices to be "Great Medicines." Whether impressed or not, many visitors found the objects both mysterious and compelling. Thermometers, quadrants, writing paper, and metal objects of all sorts were worth a special trip. It was as if <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> had become a living museum of white American life, familiar in some ways but novel in so many others. <a href="#n0446" id="ln0446" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
During most of the winter, Indians were welcomed at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> with unfailing hospitality. Only once during the entire season were Indians asked not to visit the fort. On Christmas Day, 1804, the expedition wanted to do its own celebrating. Native neighbors were told that the festivities were part of a special "medicine day" for whites only. On every other day the gates were open. When a group of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   appeared in early December, the captains "gave them victuals &amp; used them friendly." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> hospitality was well known; Indians often came early in the day, slept overnight inside the fort if invited, and left the next morning. When meat became very scarce in mid-January, many Indians came to the fort hoping to be fed. Although the expedition was not any better supplied than the villagers, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> reported that "we use them as well as possible." <a href="#n0447" id="ln0447" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Indian visitors brought to the expedition's huts a sense of friendship and "good company." Visits from Indian neighbors usually meant sharing food and enjoying a dance or some fiddle music by <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span>. There must have been time to appreciate a fine bow, a good gun, or a skillfully decorated pair of moccasins. Older men like <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> often told what <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described as "Indian aneckdotes." Although none of those stories was set down in their journals, the Americans may have heard the sorts of stories and tales told in lodges among friends. <a href="#n0448" id="ln0448" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The sheer numbers of that company sometimes tested patience on both sides of the cultural divide. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> called the Indians "good company" and in the same breath complained that "they usually pester us the ballance of the day after once being introduced to our apartment." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> peevishly recalled that on one day in mid-December he had fourteen Indians all eating in his squad room at the same time. On another occasion, when the weather suddenly turned warm at the end of December, "great numbers of indians of all discriptions Came to the fort." In fact, there were so many visitors during the day that <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> complained, "We found them troublesome in our huts." Misunderstandings were inevitable. When an Indian did something to annoy <span class="tei_name">Joseph Whitehouse</span>, the soldier struck the man on his hand with a spoon. <a href="#n0449" id="ln0449" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Despite the tensions that would naturally come when people meet each other at close quarters, the daily round of Indian visitors was a welcome part of the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> routine. Later, at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, the captains would feel compelled to issue strict regulations controlling the presence of Indians inside the palisade. The <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> rules were much looser. The only serious attempt at limiting native guests came in early February when the sergeant of the guard discovered that women belonging to the <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> households "were in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any time of night and admitting their Indian visitors." Concerned about this breach of security at a time when 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   attacks were still a real fear, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered a lock placed on the gate and restricted Indians sleeping at the fort to those either attached to the Corps of Discovery or those with invitations from the captains. <a href="#n0450" id="ln0450" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Social calling was a two-way affair during the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . Members of the expedition managed to make frequent trips to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. Those trips were usually for trade and occasionally for personal affairs, but some were simply for good company. When <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and a friend went up to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> towns during a break in the January weather, they were given a warm welcome and plenty to eat. These visits were a regular part of the explorers' lives during an otherwise difficult winter.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps the grandest, and certainly the loudest, visit paid by the expedition to the Indian towns was in celebration of New Year's Day, 1805. Both English and French traditions called for a boisterous, joyful romp to usher in the new year. On January 1, after firing two swivel guns to mark the occasion, the captains allowed sixteen men "with their Musick" to visit <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> "for the purpose of Dancing." The merry men of the expedition had told <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that their visit was made at "the perticular request of the Chiefs of that Village." Led by <span class="tei_name">John Ordway</span>, the party left the fort carrying a fiddle, a tambourine, and a sounding horn. At the entrance to <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> the Americans fired their weapons and played a brisk tune. Welcomed into the village, they marched to the central plaza, fired another round, and began to dance. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> onlookers were especially charmed by the ability of <span class="tei_name">François Rivet</span> to dance upside down on his hands. All joined in a circle around <span class="tei_name">Rivet</span>, dancing and singing. After some time all the revelers were invited into the lodges for food and gifts of buffalo robes.</p>
               <p>
Toward noon <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> appeared with <span class="tei_name">York</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, and a third man. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> walk up to <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> combined pleasure and diplomacy. "My views," he explained, "were to alay Some little Miss understanding which had taken place Thro jelloucy and mortification as to our treatment of them." When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> town, he found the festivities in full swing. To add to the merriment, he called on <span class="tei_name">York</span> to dance, "which amused the crowd very much, and somewhat astonished them, that so large a man should be active." As the good times continued throughout the afternoon, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> visited the lodges of all except two of <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka's</span> leading men. Those who did not merit a holiday greeting were guilty, so <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> charged, of "some expressions not favorable towards us, in comparing us with the traders from the north." Clearly some 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   believed that agents of the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company continued to offer better trade agreements and gifts than the Americans. But all this was put right when other 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   reassured the captains that the remarks were made "in jest and laftur." Late in the afternoon the eating and dancing finally played out and most of the men in the expedition went back to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Some stayed in <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> overnight to enjoy other kinds of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> hospitality. <a href="#n0451" id="ln0451" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
One day of New Year's celebrating simply led to another, and with a second <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village nearby, no one needed any more reason to make a second round of holiday cheer. This time it was <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> turn. Along with <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, the captain and most of the garrison went out on January 2 toward <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>. At the village there was more of what <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> described as "frolicking." Eating, dancing, and a general good time were enjoyed by soldiers and villagers alike. <a href="#n0452" id="ln0452" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The expedition and its Indian neighbors were drawn to each other not only by the shared desire for friendship but by the needs of business and trade. The explorers had an insatiable appetite for <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> corn and other produce. The kills made by expeditionary hunters had to be supplemented by buffalo and antelope brought by Indians. Filling the larders of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> brought Indian suppliers and white consumers together to haggle over what a basket of corn was worth and just how many hoes could be mended for a side of buffalo.</p>
               <p>
Although Indians occasionally brought food to the fort as a gift, the expedition learned early in its stay that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   were skilled traders who expected good measure for their crops. At the end of October, just as the Americans were establishing winter quarters, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> women began to bring corn and cornbread into camp. As <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> observed, "They expect us to give them some small article in return for their produce." <a href="#n0453" id="ln0453" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a> As winter drew on and word spread that the fort was a good market for food products, a steady stream of Indian men and women came to trade. In one typical exchange, <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span> and his wife brought a quantity of corn meal and were given some dried buffalo meat, a pot, and an axe. On another occasion <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> had his wife pack down one hundred pounds of buffalo, which was exchanged for "some small presents to the squar and [the] child [received] a small axe [with] which she was very much pleased." There is no evidence that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ever worked out a uniform price and exchange schedule in which certain amounts of corn or meat would automatically receive a set quantity of trade goods or blacksmith services. Rather, it appears that each purchase was bargained on the spot. The captains were willing to barter almost anything in their store of goods in order to maintain a steady supply of food. However, they refused to trade in firearms. When an old man came looking for a pistol in return for some corn and four buffalo robes, his offer was firmly rejected. <a href="#n0454" id="ln0454" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Because the expedition so desperately needed Indian corn and the captains knew that there was a tremendous demand among the natives for metal goods, an interesting exchange system gradually developed between <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> and the nearby villages. That system involved Indians bringing corn as payment for blacksmith work done at the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> forge. Under the direction of <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span>, a skilled smith, the expedition's force and bellows were put in place at the end of December. Iron hoes were mended, firearms were repaired, and later a brisk business was done fabricating battle axes. Indian visitors to the fort were "much surprized" by workings of the machinery and once the captains let them know of the new arrangement for trade, corn supplies quickly increased. <a href="#n0455" id="ln0455" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Until late January 1805, this system seemed to work well. Indians got hoes mended and axes sharpened while the expedition maintained a dependable store of provisions. But this exchange economy had a curious flaw. There were only so many hoes in need of repair and only a limited number of dull axes. By the end of January, the blacksmith-corn trade stood in danger of shutting down for want of Indian interest. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> then shrewdly analyzed the requirements of their Indian customers. Despite the fact that intertribal peace was a mainstay of the expedition's diplomacy, the captains decided to enter the weapons business. Their plan was both to manufacture and to repair war axes, a weapon much in demand by Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> warriors. This new aspects of expedition-Indian trade demanded an expansion of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan's</span> industrial capacity. More charcoal was needed for the forge, and on January 24 work parties were detailed to begin cutting timber. Several days later prairie grass was cut to cover a makeshift charcoal kiln. By January 29 <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported, "We are burning a large Coal pit to mend Indians hatchets, and to make war axes." The captain readily admitted that the weapons trade was vital for the expedition's survival, noting it was "the only means by which we procure corn from them." <a href="#n0456" id="ln0456" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
For the rest of the winter the smiths were busy filling Indian orders for war axes. When the forge ran far behind on orders, an old burned-out stove was salvaged and cut up to make arrow points and buffalohide scrapers. Because unworked metal was so scarce at this point, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> established a short-term exchange schedule. The smiths were to charge seven or eight gallons of corn for each four-inch piece of sheet iron. Just how important this trade had become was plain when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote that "the blacksmiths have proved a happy resource to us in our present situation as I believe it would have been difficult to have devised any other method to have procured corn from the natives." As the winter began to break in March and warriors started to talk about the spring raids, the pace of war axe production increased. By March 13, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> observed, "Many Indians here today all anxiety for war axes the smiths have not an hour of idle time to spare." Because the captains had so often emphasized the American desire to end intertribal wars, arming warriors with weapons made at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> put the explorer-diplomats in an odd position. The captains never intended to fuel the fires of raid and ambush, but neither were they so naive as to think that the "impliments of War" from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> forge were for defensive purposes only. Typical of this dilemma was the request from a <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span> war chief who came to purchase an axe and obtain permission to attack 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> warriors. For the proper price in corn the axe was handed over, but the request to use it was denied. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief must have wondered just what sort of man would arm a warrior and then tell him not to engage the enemy. The war axes were prized possessions and some ended up being traded with other Indians for equally desirable goods. How far those products of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> forge traveled was discovered some fourteen months later when the expedition, on its way home, stopped at the Pahmap 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   village. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> discovered that the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> axes were being used as pieces in an Indian gambling game. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   player explained that they had gotten the axes from some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> traders. <a href="#n0457" id="ln0457" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
If trading brought explorers and Indians closer together as business partners, those same transactions provide modern students of Indian-European relations with some valuable evidence about how each culture saw the other. The men of the expedition were often bewildered by watching the Indians bring in valuable food supplies in exchange for what seemed worthless bits of metal and fabric. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> insisted that <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> men and women were eager to have "old shirts, buttons, awls, knives, and the like articles." Other journalists in the party, as well as many early traders, agreed with that evaluation. <a href="#n0458" id="ln0458" class="ref_link"><sup>[58]</sup></a> It was equally true that Indians wondered why whites were so ready to part with precious metal goods for corn that could be grown every year. Neither group fully realized that cultures value objects and goods differently, depending on the needs and circumstances of that particular culture. A classic case of the differing perspectives on material culture was the use made by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   of a corn mill given to them by the expedition during the winter. Although the Indians were fascinated by the device, they had no use for it in its present state. On the other hand, the metal in the grinder was a scarce and valuable commodity to be made into arrow points and hide scrapers. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> promptly dismantled the mill to serve their own cultural needs. The largest piece was attached to a wooden handle and what emerged was a fine pounder for making grease from buffalo marrow bones. When <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span> saw the skillful transformation of the corn mill, he quickly labeled the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> mechanics "foolish fellows." <a href="#n0459" id="ln0459" class="ref_link"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But the Indian interest in European goods of all kinds was more than a matter of obtaining the fruits of western iron technology. Native peoples throughout North America often saw European goods as something more than just material objects. This was especially the case with guns, peace medals, Christian missionary relics, and coins. Those things were venerated as both symbols and transmitters of the strong medicine and spiritual energy the whites seemed to possess. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had some inkling of this when he wrote in 1807 that the Indians believed the first white traders "were the most powerful persons in the nation." <a href="#n0460" id="ln0460" class="ref_link"><sup>[60]</sup></a> The power of the whites could be shared with others by wearing or using things associated with them. Some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>-proper villagers gave voice to that belief when they claimed that the gifts, flags, and silver medals distributed by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> contained powerful evil forces that reflected the dangerous intent of the expedition. Fearing the "bad medicine" in the objects, the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> thought the best thing to be done with such hazardous goods was to pawn them off on unsuspecting enemies. <a href="#n0461" id="ln0461" class="ref_link"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Just as white Americans a century and a half later would prize bits of pottery and arrow points as reminders of a distant and mysterious native past, so <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> men and women valued buttons and tobacco boxes as links, for good or ill, to powerful strangers.</p>
               <p>
Although visiting and trading were important parts of life shared by Indians and explorers during the long winter months, few activities bound the men of the fort to the villagers as did hunting. Both cultures valued the hunter for his skill in a dangerous pursuit. Throughout the winter there were many joint hunting parties. Those trips, often in bitter cold and through deep snow, served to increase the sense of sharing a common life on the plains.</p>
               <p>
One such hunting venture took place in early December. When buffalo were discovered nearby, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> sent word to the fort and invited the expedition to join the chase. Always ready to replenish their food stores, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, and fourteen other men gathered with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   for the hunt. The explorers watched with admiration as the mounted Indian hunters guided the buffalo herd away from broken ground and on to a level plain where each man cut out an animal for the kill. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men were able to kill ten buffalo, five of which were packed back to the fort. The remaining dead animals were, according to plains custom, available for any hunter to butcher and take along. On the second day of the hunt, as the temperature fell to -12°F, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> joined the chase. The expedition's guns brought down several more buffalo, but the harsh cold and broken ground extracted a high price for the meat. Several of the hunters had frostbitten feet, two men had badly bruised hips from falling on hard ground, and <span class="tei_name">York</span> had a frostbitten penis. This rigorous two-day adventure added food to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> larders and surely impressed the explorers with the Indians' hunting skills. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> certainly understood the physical requirements of the winter buffalo hunt when he admitted he "felt a little fatigued haveing run after the Buffalow all day in Snow many Places 18 inches Deep, generally 6 or 8." It was that kind of understanding that made hunters from both cultures value and appreciate each other. <a href="#n0462" id="ln0462" class="ref_link"><sup>[62]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The need for medical attention was yet another force that brought Indians and explorers together during that winter. Native doctoring focused on the healing of cuts, bruises, and abrasions. Because the captains had the reputation as powerful spirit beings, some Indians believed that white medical techniques might be especially effective in serious cases. At the end of December, for example, a woman brought her child who was suffering from a severe abscess on the lower back. Anxious to obtain "some medisin," the worried mother promised "as much corn as she could carry" as payment. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> laconically wrote that "<span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis</span> administered," but his method of treatment and the outcome were not recorded. Perhaps the most serious Indian case the captains dealt with involved the young adopted son of a <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> family. At temperatures around -40°F, the young boy had wandered away from the village and had spent the night on the prairie protected only by a buffalo robe. When the boy was found, his feet were severely frostbitten. The lad's feet were put in cool water and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had hopes that the circulation would return. But the captain's expectations were too optimistic. By January 27, some seventeen days after the initial treatment, the toes on one foot were clearly infected. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> decided that in order to prevent gangrene, the toes would have to be removed. The amputation was evidently successful and it may be presumed that the boy recovered. <a href="#n0463" id="ln0463" class="ref_link"><sup>[63]</sup></a>

The sorts of sexual encounters between expedition men and Indian women that began at the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages continued during the winter among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . The young Americans were looking for something to soften the rigors of a <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> winter, and the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> women were willing for the same reasons as their <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> sisters. There is little doubt that the explorers found village women attractive. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> noted after the first <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> meeting that the Indians "had Some handsome women with them." <a href="#n0464" id="ln0464" class="ref_link"><sup>[64]</sup></a> He became involved in <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan's</span> first troublesome sexual affair. One morning, toward the end of November, the sentry on duty reported that an Indian was about to kill his wife. Hoping to stop such a violent act, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> went outside the fort for a talk with the angry husband. From the conversation came a complex tale of sexual jealousy. About eight days before, the Indian couple had had a bitter argument and the woman had left the village and spent several days with the <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> women. After a cooling-off-period, the Indian woman had returned to her husband only to have the quarrel flare up again. Beaten and stabbed three times, the terrified woman fled once again to the safety of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and her sisters. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tried to quiet the angry husband, the captain was told that <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> was somehow involved in the nasty business. The Indian claimed that <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> had slept with his wife, and "if he wanted her he would give her to him." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> then ordered <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> to give the irate man some trade goods to soothe his ruffled feathers. But at the same time, the captain chided the Indian, saying that "not one man of this party had touched his wife except the one he had given the use of her for a nite, in his own bed." Tacitly admitting that there was a good deal of intercourse between his men and the village women, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> claimed that they would not "touch a woman if they knew her to be the wife of another man." Exactly how <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew the means used to select only unmarried bed partners is unknown, but perhaps believing that <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> soldiers only slept with single women eased his conscience. In this particular case, the captain ordered that "no man of this party have any intercourse with this woman under penalty of Punishment." As for the unhappy Indian couple, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> played marriage counselor and advised the pair to go home and "live happily together in the future." <a href="#n0465" id="ln0465" class="ref_link"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although not usually so violent as the <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> affair, sexual liaisons were an accepted part of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> life. Regular visits to nearby villages and the large number of women who frequented the fort offered the opportunities sought by both sexes. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew well in advance of their departure from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> that sexual relations would be part of the expedition's experience. Understandably, they included the sorts of medical instruments and remedies believed effective against venereal diseases. Symptoms of venereal complaints were first recorded in mid-January 1805. By the end of the month at least one in the party was "very bad with the pox." As the explorers were preparing to leave <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> at the end of the winter, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made yet another revealing statement about the widespread incidence of sex with Indian women and its medical consequences. The captain reported that his crew was "generally healthy except Venerials complaints which is very common amongst the natives and the men catch it from them." <a href="#n0466" id="ln0466" class="ref_link"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Most sexual affairs during the winter were private matters that satisfied the personal needs of the different partners. But there was one <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> ceremony that involved sexual relations far beyond the personal and the private. The buffalo-calling or walking ritual involved younger men offering their wives to elderly warriors and hunters for sexual intercourse. Essential to the rite was the belief that power, in this case the hunting abilities of old men, could be transferred from one person to another by sexual relations. Buffalo calling was not simply to lure a herd close to the village but also a means of giving young men special skill in the chase. White males were also sought after as sources for great power. As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> himself noted, "The Indians say all white flesh is medisan." The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> agreed, saying that "the white men are powerful, they are like magic." Just how many men in the expedition obligingly took part in the ritual is unknown, but the trader <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> reported that many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   believed their prompt success in the January hunts was due to white participation in the ceremony. As <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> wryly put it, the explorers were "untiringly zealous in attracting the cow." <a href="#n0467" id="ln0467" class="ref_link"><sup>[67]</sup></a>

                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would have been the first to agree that the months of November and December 1804 were troubled ones for their Indian diplomacy. What seemed a set of reliable agreements negotiated at the end of October were undetermined by rumor, distrust, and the power of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> alliance. The expedition's efforts to repair the damage appeared futile. Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could only wait as <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> tried to woo the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> back into the American fold, they could take action to settle <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> concerns and squelch <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> rumor-mongering. On the afternoon of January 15, four "considerable men of the <span class="tei_name">Menetarre</span>" paid a call at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Knowing how infrequent were <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> visits, the captains were determined to pay special attention to men "who had been impressed with an unfavorable oppinion of us." Because the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> were flattered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> hospitality, the captains evidently believed some sort of diplomatic thaw was in the air. <a href="#n0468" id="ln0468" class="ref_link"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the next day, the four <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> still at the fort were joined by some thirty 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . What followed did nothing either to allay the expedition's worries about <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> tensions or to build confidence in a stable villager alliance. Seeing the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> immediately accused them of being liars. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> charged they had been told by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   that expeditionary soldiers would kill any <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> who came to the fort. Clearly nothing had changed since <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first heard the same sort of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> rumors at the end of November. The <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> guests were plainly pleased and relieved with their reception at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, but they were not about to accept the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   as either allies or friends. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   were "bad and ought to hide themselves," declared the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> now found themselves in a difficult position. As the most powerful military force among the villagers, the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> were essential for American policy. At the same time, <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> raids against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and other western tribes endangered not only federal Indian policy but the immediate security of the expedition once it left <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. All these considerations called for closer ties with the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. But it appeared that those ties would have to be forged at the expense of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> good will. This was a knot that no expedition blade could cut. Simply urging a young <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war chief to abandon a horse-stealing raid on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and calling for peace among the village folk would only produce an illusion of diplomatic progress. <a href="#n0469" id="ln0469" class="ref_link"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
That so much was still unsettled was brought home with great force in the middle of February. On February 14, <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Robert Frazer</span>, <span class="tei_name">Silas Goodrich</span>, and <span class="tei_name">John Newman</span> were sent downriver with three horses and sleds to retrieve meat cached from an earlier hunt. Some twenty-five miles from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, the Americans stumbled into the middle of a large <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   raiding party. "Hooping and yelling," the warriors cut the horses from the sleds and "jurked the halters from one to the other through several hands." Two horses, a fine gelding belonging to <span class="tei_name">Charles Mackenzie</span> and a mount in the expedition, were taken by the warriors. The third horse, a grey mare, was returned to the explorers "by the intersetion of an Indian who assumed some authority on the occasion, probably more through fear of himself or some of the Indians being killed by our men who were not disposed to be robed of all they had tamely." It was well after dark when the men finally straggled in to make their unhappy report.</p>
               <p>
News that part of the expedition had been attacked by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors who might still be close by galvanized the Americans at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> into action. The captains quickly sent two men to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages asking for Indian support to chase down the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . About midnight <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, several other chiefs, and a number of older <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> men arrived at the fort. Explaining that most of the young men in <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span> were out hunting and had taken the best guns with them, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> could not offer much in the way of armed support. A few warriors and only two guns proved to be the final <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> contribution. <a href="#n0470" id="ln0470" class="ref_link"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
At dawn on February 15, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, and twenty-some soldiers and Indians left <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> to pursue the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   raiders. From the beginning it was a mission destined to fail. The weather was bad, the snow deep, and the men soon had their feet cut and bleeding on the sharp ice. As the day wore on, most of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   abandoned the search. They knew the trail was cold and the cause hopeless. Near the end of the day, after some thirty miles of grueling march, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men found two abandoned tepees. Exhausted by their journey, the men slept in the tepees overnight. The next day <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> realized that a continued pursuit of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   was senseless. Until returning to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> on February 21, the party conducted a successful hunt, eventually bringing to the fort some 2400 pounds of much-needed meat. <a href="#n0471" id="ln0471" class="ref_link"><sup>[71]</sup></a> The meat was a valuable consolation prize, but it only served to remind the captains that their words and weapons had not yet changed Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> realities. The <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were still their own masters, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> appeared unreliable and unwilling to abandon their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   trading partners, and the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villagers seemed bent on squabbling with each other.</p>
               <p>
In the wake of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   attack, it was more important than ever for the captains to know just where the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> stood. The raiding party had attempted to implicate <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> in the assault on <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and his men by leaving behind some telltale kernels of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn. Although the captains saw through this ruse, the need for accurate information about <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> sentiments was even more urgent than it had been in November when <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> were asked to investigate the question. It was not until the end of February that the results of their inquiry became known. On February 28, <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>, two French engagés, and some Indians came up from the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> with a letter from <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>. Although the text of the letter has not survived, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> summary of it indicates that at least some of the news was reassuring. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> reported that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> had nothing but "peaceable dispositions" toward the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. He closed by noting the supposed intention of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> to abandon their <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages and live in the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> region. This move, <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> explained, would make an alliance against the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   much easier to sustain. When the explorers told several <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> plans, the Indians declared that "they had always wished to be at peace and good neighbors with the <span class="tei_name">Recaras</span>, and it is also the sentiments of all the <span class="tei_name">Big Bellies</span> and Shoe nations." The reply must have further pleased the captains, although the <span class="tei_name">Mandans'</span> sincerity in welcoming the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> as neighbors again was questionable.</p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were relieved to hear <span class="tei_name">Tabeau's</span> news, they were anything but pleased to hear the more ominous and realistic evaluation of the tribal situation from <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>. He had heard that the <span class="tei_name">Sisseton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and three of the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands intended "to come to war in a short time against the nations in this quarter and will kill every white man they see." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, who heard <span class="tei_name">Gravelines'</span> report, understood that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   saw the Americans as "bad medicine." While the Frenchman explained that neither <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> band of <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   nor the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were part of the threat, enough Indians were supposedly involved to give the captains more than a moment of real concern. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> described the expedition's fears with characteristic bluntness. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , wrote <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, were preparing "to massacre the whole of us in the Spring." <a href="#n0472" id="ln0472" class="ref_link"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The accuracy of <span class="tei_name">Gravelines'</span> prediction of a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   attack on <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> and the surrounding villages cannot be known. There was no doubt that many <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> saw <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as a dangerous force. The Americans had challenged <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> economic power, threatened by the important <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> connection, and were attempting to forge a military and commercial alliance against the nomads. There was surely sufficient reason for any number of war parties to move against the expedition. But there is no evidence that such a move was planned by any of the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands. For all the talk of a spring massacre, the captains did not appear to take <span class="tei_name">Gravelines'</span> warning seriously. It may have been that by the end of the winter the diplomatic education of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was sufficiently advanced so that they knew something about the difference between rumor and reality. More likely, their knowledge that they would leave the region in early spring made the threat less menacing.</p>
               <p>
March was the last full month the expedition spent at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. To the daily routine of trading, hunting, and tending the hut fires were now added the time-consuming preparations for the second year of western travel. Canoe builders were busy making four craft while others were checking ropes, clothing, and vital hardware. Ice breaking up in the river and the return of biting gnats were sure signs of spring and the time of departure.</p>
               <p>
Preparations were interrupted early in March by the arrival of a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> delegation. On a cold, windy March morning, as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> walked up to inspect the canoe builders, he met the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>-proper chief <span class="tei_name">La Borgne</span>. The chief was surely the most influential of the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> village leaders, and his apparent refusal to parley with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> throughout the winter was a real defeat for their diplomacy. <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> had made no attempt to hide his disdain for the captains. <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> had reported earlier in the year <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne's</span> barbed sarcasm aimed at the explorers. Taunting the Americans, the chief declared that he would visit <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> only if the captains would give him their largest flag. <a href="#n0473" id="ln0473" class="ref_link"><sup>[73]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
That remark seemed to justify the impression most white travelers on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> had about the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief. <span class="tei_name">Henry M. Brackenridge</span>, calling <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> "one of the most extraordinary men I ever knew," described the chief as "sometimes a cruel and abominable tyrant" who ruled with "unlimited control." <span class="tei_name">Brackenridge's</span> fellow traveler John Bradbury agreed. The English naturalist used words like "monster," "savage" and "ferocious" to portray <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span>. Tales relating <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne's</span> violence and strength gained wide currency in the region; <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> told <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> one such story about the chief's murder of a faithless wife. While <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> was unquestionably a man of personal strength and ability, he was neither the tyrant nor the brute presented in the records of those who actually saw little or nothing of him. <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span> did have much experience with <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> and this trader's observations suggest a very different sort of man. Now in his mid-forties, the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief had become a skilled warrior and astute diplomat. Under his leadership the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> had made important trade alliances with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   while gaining considerable advantage over the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. During July 1806, <span class="tei_name">Henry</span> watched with admiration as <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> pursued complex negotiations with 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   bands. "He does everything," wrote the trader, "in a composed, deliberate, and cool manner." <a href="#n0474" id="ln0474" class="ref_link"><sup>[74]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although it is now unclear what sort of calculation brought <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> on March 9, 1805, it was a move the chief would not have taken without careful thought. Because <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> spent much of the day with the canoe builders and later at <span class="tei_name">Rooptahee</span>, just what passed between <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> is unknown. It is certainly plain that the chief was shown all the respect due his position and was showered with gifts. Hearing that <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> had not received the presents sent to him after the October 1804 meetings, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> made a special point to offer a wide variety of goods, including a shirt, some scarlet cloth, a flag, and a metal gorget. To impress the chief with western technology, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> brought out the airgun, the quadrant, and a spyglass, all of which <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> pronounced "Great Medicines." Perhaps the most charming moment of the day came when <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> spotted York standing nearby. The chief had heard about <span class="tei_name">York's</span> blackness from young warriors. Doubting what they had seen, the chief called for <span class="tei_name">York</span> to be brought to him. Thinking that perhaps <span class="tei_name">York's</span> color was paint, <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> spit on his own hand and vigorously rubbed <span class="tei_name">York's</span> skin. When <span class="tei_name">York</span> removed the handkerchief from his head and showed <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> his hair, the chief was astonished and promptly declared that the black man "was of a different species from the whites."</p>
               <p>
The meeting with <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> must have seemed strangely anticlimatic. So much had happened over the winter that made the captains need the support or at least the understanding of the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief. But on the vital questions of Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> diplomacy the expedition's record for March 9 is strangely silent. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> broached the subject of a villager alliance and trade with <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, perhaps <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> showed no interest in pursuing such matters. Whatever his feelings, <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> made no promises. The two swivel guns fired in his honor at the end of the meeting signaled nothing except the failure of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomacy to change <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> minds. <a href="#n0475" id="ln0475" class="ref_link"><sup>[75]</sup></a>

               <p>
When the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter was nearly over, two incidents occurred that symbolized the experience of that season for both the expedition and its Indian neighbors. Toward the end of March, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> heard that two <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war parties had left the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> villages and a third was soon to depart. It was not the kind of news that would give much comfort or sense of accomplishment to diplomats seeking intertribal peace. Intent on counting coup against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   or other western peoples, the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> warriors had paid no more than passing attention to proposals so earnestly promoted by the captains. Had the expedition's diplomats carefully checked <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> weapons, they might have been even more dismayed. Many of their war axes probably bore the marks of having been made at the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> forge. <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war parties venturing out this spring, as they had for many springs, were a simple reminder of how little had changed. The much talked-about villager coalition against the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   was still more real in the captains' minds than in the actions of men like <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> or <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span>. Tensions between <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villagers were certain to flare up once American traders came from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. Each village would want to corner the market on manufactured goods, just as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   had tried to monopolize the expedition and frighten away potential <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> customers. The future of trade between <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> was equally uncertain. How <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages and <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands would react to a flood of goods passing them on the way upriver was unknown. There was no evidence that North West Company men like <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> were about to concede the northern plains to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> interests. Nor was there any hint that <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa Indians</span> were ready to abandon traditional trading partners like the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   for the untried Americans. All the lively and complex issues <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had been talking about with <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> Indians since the days of August at the <span class="tei_name">Council Bluff</span> camp were still unresolved.</p>
               <p>
But if <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomacy produced few if any of the changes sought by the explorers, it would be misleading to declare the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter either a failure or a disappointment. In many ways the months at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> were both productive and peaceful. During the 1805–1806 winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, surrounded by dampness and subjected to an unending fare of foul elk meat and dried salmon, many in the party would recall the bracing plains climate and tasty diet with considerable nostalgia. Personal relations between explorers and villagers during the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter were marked by genuine good feeling with only few misunderstandings. Those friendships made it possible for the expedition to spend a winter on the plains with a sense of security unrivaled in the history of North American exploration. That sense of harmony, security, and good spirits can be felt in the last visit <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> paid to <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> on an unseasonably warm day in early April. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> smoked with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief "as is their custom," and when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> presented him with a pair of beautifully decorated moccasins. If the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war parties were an unpleasant reminder of unachieved goals, those moccasins symbolized what good neighbors both peoples had been. The simple rituals of hunting, eating, trading, and sleeping together had bound the explorers and villagers together during a <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> winter.
