Illustrators charged with making a picture to represent "The <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> Expedition" have usually produced variations on a familiar theme: the two captains, slightly differentiated by dress, gaze off into the western distance; <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a> stands nearby with her infant, sometimes pointing the way. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> black servant, <a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">York</a>, is usually prominent, especially in recent years, and <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Toussaint Charbonneau</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>

In the background an anonymous collection of buckskin-clad figures representing the rest of the party follow their leaders' gaze toward the horizon or go about their labors. This familiar picture represents the popular conception of the expedition; unfortunately, it also represents fairly accurately the actual state of knowledge about the men who went with the captains on their great trek. <a href="#n01" id="ln01" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

	About the captains there is abundant information; most of the Corps of Discovery, however, lived obscure lives before and after their season of glory. For many there exists the scantiest record, or none at all, about their lives before 1803 and after 1806. The records of the expedition themselves provide, in most cases, only the barest hints about their personalities, virtues, and weaknesses. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">William Clark</a> seems to have thought of the permanent party as his "Band of Brothers," in some sense; he had some interest in their later careers, but even he apparently lost track of several of them. Some twenty years after the return to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>, he drew up a list of thirty-four; eighteen, including <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, he knew or believed to be dead—six of them, in testimony to the hazards of frontier life, listed as "killed"—and for five he apparently had no information. One of those he thought dead, <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a>, not only was alive but would outlive <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> and every other expedition member. <a href="#n02" id="ln02" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

               <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a> has attracted much attention in this century from historians and writers of fiction, but the amount written about her far exceeds the actual information about her life and personality. <a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">York</a> is a natural symbol of black participation in the westward movement, but even less is known of him as a man. <a class="regularization" title="Colter, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Colter%2C%20John">John Colter</a> acquired fame in his own right as an explorer through his travels and adventures in the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a> after the expedition. <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Toussaint</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</a> have shared some of <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</a> glory. For most of the rest, even such journal keepers as <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">John Ordway</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</a>, we can give at best a brief sketch of their lives. For some, we cannot even be sure of the correct spelling of their names.</p>
            <p>
	The captains drew their men from three principal sources: Anglo-American frontiersmen from the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> Valley, U.S. Army enlisted men, and the French settlers of <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Missouri" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri">Missouri</a>. In the letter offering <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> the chance to second him on the expedition, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> wrote that his friend should recruit some young men in <a class="regularization" title="Kentucky" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Indiana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Indiana">Indiana</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> was instructed to pick backwoodsmen, skilled in hunting and outdoor life and used to hardship, rather than "young gentlemen." <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had several recruits gathered at <a class="regularization" title="Clarksville, Ind." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clarksville%2C%20Ind.">Clarksville</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Indiana Territory" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Indiana%20Territory">Indiana Territory</a>, when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> picked him up in October 1803; those have become known as the "Nine Young Men from <a class="regularization" title="Kentucky" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kentucky">Kentucky</a>," although two of the men listed under that head, <a class="regularization" title="Shannon, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George">George Shannon</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Colter, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Colter%2C%20John">John Colter</a>, may have joined Lewis on his journey down the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> by the time he reached <a class="regularization" title="Cincinnati, Ohio" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati</a>. <a href="#n03" id="ln03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

            <p>
	Most of the remaining men evidently joined the expedition during the winter at <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River Dubois</a>. Many were enlisted men from four companies of the U.S. Army stationed at small posts in the West: <a class="regularization" title="Bissell, Daniel" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bissell%2C%20Daniel">Captain Daniel Bissell's</a> company of the First Infantry Regiment, stationed at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Massac (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Massac%20%28Ill.%29">Fort Massac</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a>; <a class="regularization" title="Bissell, Russell" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bissell%2C%20Russell">Captain Russell Bissell's</a> company of the same regiment, stationed at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Kaskaskia (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Kaskaskia%20%28Ill.%29">Fort Kaskaskia</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a>; <a class="regularization" title="Campbell, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Campbell%2C%20John">Captain John Campbell's</a> company of the Second Infantry Regiment, stationed in <a class="regularization" title="Tennessee" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Tennessee">Tennessee</a>; and <a class="regularization" title="Stoddard, Amos" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Stoddard%2C%20Amos">Captain Amos Stoddard's</a> company of artillerists, stationed at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Kaskaskia (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Kaskaskia%20%28Ill.%29">Fort Kaskaskia</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> seems to have suspected that the men sent from <a class="regularization" title="Tennessee" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, at least, were picked on the time-honored principle of getting rid of those who could best be spared by their original unit (see <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> entry, <a href="lc.jrn.1803-12-22">December 22, 1803</a>). Some backwoodsmen from the <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Missouri" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri">Missouri</a> settlements may have joined during the winter, but for a number of men there is no indication of when and where they first joined or whether they were already in the army. All those not already in the military service who were chosen for the permanent party enlisted as soldiers, except <a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">York</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> slave, and <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">George Drouillard</a>, the civilian interpreter and hunter. Two French boatmen with experience in the Indian trade on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">François Labiche</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</a>, enlisted for the permanent party. <a href="#n04" id="ln04" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
	It would appear that the captains decided during the winter of 1803–4 that they would send back a party of men from somewhere up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> during the first year of the expedition. Such a party could carry back dispatches, maps, completed journals, and plant, animal, mineral, and anthropological specimens to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">President Jefferson</a>, giving him a progress report and sparing the expedition the labor of carrying such objects for the entire journey. The thought that something would be saved if they themselves failed to return must have been in their minds. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Dubois</a> Journal contains several lists of names, marked and annotated, showing that he was evaluating the men and trying to determine, on the basis of character and ability, who should be in the permanent and return parties. By <a href="lc.jrn.1804-04-01">April 1, 1804</a>, as indicated by a detachment order, the captains had determined the constitution of the two parties, so far as the enlisted soldiers were concerned, and for the most part they adhered to that plan. Certain changes became necessary because of subsequent events, a possibility they had no doubt anticipated from the start. For instance, the two enlisted French boatmen, <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">François Labiche</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</a>, joined the ranks of the permanent party. <a class="regularization" title="Reed, Moses B." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Reed%2C%20Moses%20B.">Moses B. Reed</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Newman, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Newman%2C%20John">John Newman</a> were expelled from the permanent party, the first for desertion, the other for insubordination. <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd</a> died, and <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a>, another member of the permanent party, assumed his rank. To make up the losses in the permanent party, the captains transferred <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Robert Frazer</a> from the original return party and enlisted <a class="regularization" title="Lepage, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lepage%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste Lepage</a>, a French trapper encountered at the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages.</p>
            <p>
	As matters developed, the return party did not set out during the summer or fall of 1804, as originally planned. On <a href="lc.jrn.1805-04-07">April 7, 1805</a>, when the captains and the permanent party left <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> headed up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, they were able to send back this return group in the keelboat and one canoe. An exact list exists for the group bound for the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, but for the returning body there remain some mysteries. <a class="regularization" title="Warfington, Richard" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Warfington%2C%20Richard">Corporal Richard Warfington</a> was in charge of the party, and the captains both say that he had with him in the keelboat six soldiers and two Frenchmen, with two more Frenchmen in the canoe.</p>
            <p>
	Among the six soldiers were <a class="regularization" title="Reed, Moses B." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Reed%2C%20Moses%20B.">Reed</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Newman, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Newman%2C%20John">Newman</a>, expelled from the permanent party. Four other soldiers were intended from the first for the return party, probably Privates <a class="regularization" title="Boley, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Boley%2C%20John">John Boley</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Dame, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Dame%2C%20John">John Dame</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Tuttle, Ebenezer" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Tuttle%2C%20Ebenezer">Ebenezer Tuttle</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="White, Isaac" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=White%2C%20Isaac">Isaac White</a>. It seems possible, if unlikely, that the mysterious <a class="regularization" title="Robertson, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Robertson%2C%20John">John Robertson</a>, or <a class="regularization" title="Robertson, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Robertson%2C%20John">Robinson</a>, was one of them, instead of either <a class="regularization" title="Tuttle, Ebenezer" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Tuttle%2C%20Ebenezer">Tuttle</a> or <a class="regularization" title="White, Isaac" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=White%2C%20Isaac">White</a> (see the sketch of <a class="regularization" title="Robertson, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Robertson%2C%20John">Robertson</a>). <a href="#n05" id="ln05" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
	Most of the returning Frenchmen were certainly <em class="hi">engagés—</em>hired boatmen—who had been with the expedition from the start. It is quite clear from the records that the captains regarded their status to be entirely different from that of the enlisted men. They were not soldiers and did not require the same care in record keeping as that demanded by the army. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> usual difficulties in spelling were compounded with French names, and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> spelling of French names was not much better.</p>
            <p>
Another factor complicating the records was the custom of the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> valley French of giving <em class="hi">dit</em> names, nicknames by which a man might be better known than by his surname. Unlike English nicknames, these might be passed on from father to son and were considered significant enough to be used in official records. Commonly they referred either to a personal characteristic or to a place of origin or residence. Thus we have Louis Blanchette, <em class="hi">dit le Chasseur</em> (the hunter), founder of <a class="regularization" title="Saint Charles, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Charles%2C%20Mo.">St. Charles</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Missouri" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri">Missouri</a>, and Jacques Chauvin, <em class="hi">dit Charlesville,</em> probably after the city in <a class="regularization" title="France" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=France">France</a>. Hence, French names in expedition records may be either surnames or <em class="hi">dit</em> names, and this may account for some of the inconsistencies in the lists. <a href="#n06" id="ln06" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
There are two principal lists of <em class="hi">engagés,</em> which were evidently intended to be complete, one in a detachment order of <a href="lc.jrn.1804-05-26">May 26, 1804</a>, the other in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Field Notes under <a href="lc.jrn.1804-07-04">July 4, 1804</a>. They are inconsistent in both names and numbers, and there is no certainty whether the inconsistencies represent additions or discharges, use of surnames or <em class="hi">dit</em> names, or simple forgetfulness. There is also a record of men paid off in <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> after their return from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in 1805, but it is obviously incomplete. Some of the men may not appear there because they were discharged at the <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Arikara</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages in the fall of 1804 and received their pay in cash. It is at least possible that men were added or discharged along the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, recruited from <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>–bound trading parties or leaving the expedition and joining such a party. The captains' lack of attention to the Frenchmen may have extended to failure to note such changes among the <em class="hi">engagés.</em>

The purpose of this appendix is to give brief sketches of those known to be associated with the expedition up to August 24, 1804. Individuals are listed alphabetically within groups: the leaders; sergeants; privates, corporal, interpreter, and servant; and <em class="hi">engagés.</em> Sketches of <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Lepage, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lepage%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste Lepage</a>, all of whom joined during the winter of 1804–5 at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, will appear in the next volume. For the two captains only a brief biography is necessary. For most of the others it is possible to include most of the principal facts, with an indication of the sources for further study. In most cases there is no new, previously unpublished information, but an effort has been made to draw together the work of previous researchers in the field. In a few cases, doubts and unresolved questions about some men, such as <a class="regularization" title="Robertson, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Robertson%2C%20John">John Robertson</a> and <a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">La Liberté</a>, have necessitated disproportionately long sketches of men whose actual importance to the expedition was minor.</p>

If <a class="regularization" title="Robertson, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Robertson%2C%20John">Robertson</a> was with the expedition until June 12, it is peculiar that he is not mentioned in the May 26 detachment order.

In 1825–28 <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> listed him as living on the <a class="regularization" title="Sangamon River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Sangamon%20River">Sangamon River</a> in <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a>.

He seems to have been about the same age as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, or a few years younger, and to have been <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> companion from childhood, in the fashion of the slaveholding South. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> legally inherited <a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">York</a> from his father in 1799. The journals and other primary sources indicate that he was large and strong and perhaps overweight. He seems to have carried a gun and to have performed his full share of the duties with other members of the party; a body servant who could neither defend himself nor carry his share of the load would have been an unacceptable luxury on the expedition. Tales of his sexual prowess among Indian women or of his being the expedition's buffoon rest largely on the racial bias of later historians, not on evidence in the journals. <a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">York</a> received his freedom sometime after 1811 and then operated a wagon freight business in <a class="regularization" title="Tennessee" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Kentucky" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kentucky">Kentucky</a>.

He took the opportunity to quit the expedition, and though a party was sent to apprehend him, he escaped and appears no more in the expedition record.

Thus, a <a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">La Liberté</a> was working for the North West Company in <a class="regularization" title="Canada" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Canada">Canada</a> in 1799 and might be the same man.

His singularly appropriate name may be only a <em class="hi">dit</em> name, not a formal surname. He does not appear under that name in the list of <em class="hi">engagés</em> in the detachment order of May 26, 1804; this could mean that he was hired later, perhaps picked up from some party of traders headed down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>.

               <a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">La Liberty</a> of portage des <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians">Scioux</a>."

This could explain how <a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">La Liberté</a> became "<a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">Joseph Le bartee</a>" in that list.</p>
            <p>	The question remains, however, whether there were two men with this <em class="hi">dit</em> name or only one, and whether, if there were two, <a class="regularization" title="Collin, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collin%2C%20Joseph">Collin</a> was the deserter. (Technically, he was not a deserter in the military sense because he was a hired boatman rather than an enlisted man.) There is no record of <a class="regularization" title="Collin, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collin%2C%20Joseph">Collin's</a> having been paid, which would have been the case if he had deserted, but it could also mean that, like some other <em class="hi">engagés,</em> he was discharged at the <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Arikara</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages and paid in cash. A man picked up at the <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Arikaras</a> in 1806, who had perhaps been with the expedition in 1804, could have been <a class="regularization" title="Collin, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collin%2C%20Joseph">Collin</a>; this man, in any case, could hardly have been the deserter, since he would have avoided the expedition, and they would not have given him a ride home. Thus it is quite possible that <a class="regularization" title="Collin, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collin%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Collin</a> bore the <em class="hi">dit</em> name <a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">La Liberté</a> and is referred to as "<a class="regularization" title="La Liberté" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=La%20Libert%C3%A9">Joseph Le bartee</a>" by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> because of this.
