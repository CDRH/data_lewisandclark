            <h3>APPENDIX III Much Ado About Little—The Case of the Lydia</h3>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
In the spring of 1803, a trading ship hunting for sea-otter pelts sailed into <span class="tei_name">Nootka Sound</span> on the west coast of <span class="tei_name">Vancouver Island</span>, <span class="tei_name">British Columbia</span>. Resentful of several years of mistreatment by white traders, the Indians 
massacred all the crew except the ship's twenty-year-old, English-born armorer (blacksmith) John Jewitt, and the sailmaker, John Thompson. Those two languished as prisoners until rescued on July 19, 1805, by Captain Samuel Hill of the brig <span class="italic">Lydia</span>, out of <span class="tei_name">Boston</span>. The salvation was effected without bloodshed, and on departing for further trading operations along the Northwest Coast, Captain Hill said he would return to <span class="tei_name">Nootka</span> within a few months to pick up whatever pelts the Indians gathered during his absence.</p>
               <p>
Throughout his captivity, young John Jewitt kept a secret diary, using berry juice as ink. His entries, however, ceased with his rescue, and thereby hangs our tale. On finally reaching <span class="tei_name">Boston</span> by way of China late in the spring of 1807, Jewitt made arrangements for a printer to issue <span class="italic">A Journal Kept at <span class="tei_name">Nootka Sound</span>
                  </span>. It was dull—terse because of necessity and vapid because the ill-educated sailor had "small capacity as a narrator," 
to borrow the words of Richard Alsop of <span class="tei_name">Hartford</span>, <span class="tei_name">Connecticut</span>, a rich merchant with literary ambitions. Alsop plucked the needed drama out of Jewitt bit by bit. Using <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> as a model, he then published in 1815 a <span class="italic">Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt</span>. Although the style is turgid and the tone elevated, the Narrative kept being reprinted until as late as 1975 (Robert F. Heizer, editor, <span class="italic">Narrative of ... John R. Jewitt</span> [taken from the edition of 1820], published by the Bellona Press of Ramona, California). During those many decades it has become a standard item of students of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition for the following reasons.</p>
               <p>
As stated, Jewitt left off his diary with his rescue. His story was blood, thunder, and life with the Indians. English-born, he cared next to nothing about <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Alsop, however, wanted to get his hero home to his loved ones. So he continued pumping Jewitt about the last stages of the story and in the process learned that during the course of sailing tediously back and forth along the coast, the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> had crept about ten miles into the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> estuary in search of a convenient stand of timber from which to cut a new mast and spars. While the traders were there, visiting Indians showed the mariners medals given them by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who, they said had arrived by land with a small party and then, only a fortnight earlier, had started home, again by land.</p>
               <p>
Alsop pounced. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would certainly interest American readers, for in this year of 1814, when Alsop was interviewing Jewitt, <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> and Paul Allen had finally published their official <span class="italic">History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, to the Sources of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, thence across the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span> and down the <span class="tei_name">River Columbia</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Ocean</span> ... during the Years 1804–5–6</span>. We can imagine Alsop digging away: how about some details? And we can imagine Jewitt shrugging. All that boring search for pelts from one foggy anchorage to the next—no blood and thunder in that. There were no details.</p>
               <p>
Well, then, when had the encounter with the <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span> Indians taken place? Jewitt looked back across eight or nine years at the blur. No diary to refresh his memory. Another shrug. Maybe it had been in November, shortly before the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> had returned to <span class="tei_name">Nootka</span>, as promised, for more pelts. At least he thought the brig went back to <span class="tei_name">Nootka</span> in November.</p>
               <p>
And then? Again we can picture a shrug. Nothing much—more wandering along the coast—a pelt here, a pelt there—until mid-August, 1806, when Hill at last struck across the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> for Macao, China. He paused there to swap his furs for Oriental goods in demand in <span class="tei_name">Boston</span>. During the layover, Jewitt sent a letter to his mother by an earlier ship to let her know he was still alive—a small point for us to remember later.</p>
               <p>
Bridging the gap between Jewitt's rescue and his homecoming filled roughly two pages of Alsop's 160-page Narrative. Of those two pages two sentences were devoted to the encounter with the Indians who had the medals <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had given them—throwaway lines as far as Jewitt was concerned. But to American students of the expedition they 
were exciting. November! Why, from November 8 or so to the 25th, the explorers had been camping at various spots along the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> estuary, the same side where the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> had anchored. On 
the 25th the Americans had moved to the south side, where some of them had stayed until early December before going a couple of miles inland to build <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. How ironic! How dramatic! The Corps had been desperate for the kind of supplies the Lydia carried. They were eager to send specimens and reports to the president. And the ship had been 
there! Yet they had not seen it. They had not heard a word about it from the Indians. And the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> had learned nothing of them until after the whites had gone inland to settle at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>—a move the Indians represented as a departure for the East. How amazing!</p>
               <p>
Amazing is right. This blind leap at an offhand remark by Alsop/Jewitt put the historians who made the jump in an untenable position. (I admit to being one of them—Lavender, <span class="italic">Land of Giants</span>, New York: Doubleday, 1958, pp. 73–74—until I examined the entire context of the Jewitt Narrative.) While it is barely possible, given the state of the weather, that the Americans did not see the brig, it is inconceivable that the small parties of Indians who stopped by their camps every day to gossip and sell food and furs did not mention the ship—if it was in the vicinity. Some historians evade the issue, saying the Indians' silence was an enigma. Others have cooked up a conspiracy theory. The <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> from the many different bands, they say, had agreed to seal their lips as a way of taking revenge on the whites because <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had threatened to shoot them for stealing from the Corps. Well, possibly they stayed silent while the explorers might still have reached the <span class="italic">Lydia</span>. But what about the nearly four months that followed? Several <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> visited <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> during the period. Did none boast of the feat in order to watch the whites squirm? Members of other tribes, <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cathlamets</span>, also floated in and out. None mentioned the <span class="italic">Lydia</span>, ever. Such an unbroken veil of secrecy among the gossippy, far-traveling, curious Indians—remember how fast the news of the beached whales spread—passes credulity.</p>
               <p>
Conspiracy is a favorite refuge for those unwilling to face simple, direct explanations. Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy entirely on his own? No, no. There had to be conspirators in the background. Similar reasoning holds that all the Indians living around the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> delta agreed to stay silent about the Lydia in order to—well, discomfit <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who actually would have traded eagerly with them for supplies, if they had been able to get the necessary goods from the ship. To suppose the shrewd-bargaining Indians did not realize this 
is to suppose they wanted to do themselves out of business for the sake of a small revenge.</p>
               <p>
There is a simpler explanation. From <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis's</span> journal we know that shortly before the Corps left <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> on March 23, 1806, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and he gave to several Indians a written notice of their crossing, together with a rough map of their route and a list of the expedition's personnel. They asked the recipients of these documents, some of whom had medals as well, to pass the papers along to the first trading ships that showed up. Their hope was to let <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> know as soon as possible that they had indeed reached the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>; after all, they might not get back, and history should be aware of their feat. Then off they went. Shortly thereafter, in April, the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> definitely did enter the estuary. Indians thronged around, and one of them gave Captain Hill one of the documents. He carried it to China, where he arrived in December 1806. Knowing he would be delayed there by his mercantile enterprises, he handed the papers to another ship captain for delivery. Almost surely the 
paper traveled to New England aboard the same ship that carried Jewitt's letter to his mother. And that indeed is irony, because the rescued blacksmith could have straightened out the matter then and there by mentioning the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> documents. But <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were nothing to him—so little, in fact, that when Alsop probed for details, Jewitt probably got his dates mixed up. He said that after cutting spars in the estuary, the Lydia had returned to <span class="tei_name">Nootka</span>, arriving there late in November. It is more likely, however, that the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> had gone to <span class="tei_name">Nootka</span> in April, after the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> papers had fallen into Hill's hands. It was an easy mistake to make, considering all the beating back and forth along the coast the ship had done during those winter months.</p>
               <p>
Of course it is possible that the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> also went to <span class="tei_name">Nootka</span> in November, after pausing in the estuary shortly before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived there. Such a pause would account for the frequent mentions of a ship 
in the delta that the Americans heard as they descended the river, only to be greeted by empty water when they arrived. But whether or not the <span class="italic">Lydia</span> bracketed the explorers' months in the area or simply arrived in April, the main point is that there was no ship there during the Americans' stay. The matter would hardly merit mention if the legend weren't still being delivered to wide-eyed tourists in the Northwest as another item of great drama in real life.</p>
