In the couse of last night had several showers of hail and rain attended with thunder and lightning.    about day a heavy storm came on from the S W attended with hail rain and a continued roar of thunder and some
lightning.    the hail was as large as musket balls and covered the ground perfectly.    we hand some of it collected which kept very well through the day and served to cool our water. These showers and gusts keep my boat wet in dispite of my exertions.    she is not yet ready for the grease and coal.    after the hail and rain was over this morning we dispatched 4 hunters and two canoes to the head of the rappids as we had determined last evening.    the red and yellow courants <a href="#n16070601" id="ln16070601" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> are now ripe and abundant, they are reather ascid as yet.
