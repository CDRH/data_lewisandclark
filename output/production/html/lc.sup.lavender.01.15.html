            <h3>FIFTEEN. Wild Water</h3>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
After so many days of plodding, the discoverers must have felt a heady exhilaration when the swift current of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>, as the river is called today, whipped their loglike dugouts downstream toward the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. But the water was also low in October, and every so often clusters of black rocks rose ominously above tangles of frothing waves. <a href="#n1501" id="ln1501" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The first wreck, which can typify the rest, came just one day after the launching. They had successfully passed "fifteen rapids, four islands, and a Creek." Perhaps they were cocky. Anyway, the boat <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Gass</span> was steering, either with a sweep oar or a big, Indian-style paddle, banged into a boulder and tossed him overboard. One side of the dugout split open, letting water pour in. Fortunately, that part of the river, though swift, was only waist 
deep and salvage was possible. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described it: "the men, Several of which Could not swim hung onto the Canoe. I had one of the other Canoes unloaded &amp; with the assistance of our Small Canoe and one Indian Canoe took out everything &amp; toed the empty Canoe on Shore, one man <span class="tei_name">Tompson</span> a little hurt." <a href="#n1502" id="ln1502" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Most of the cargo was soaked, of course, and had to be spread out to dry while the canoe was repaired—under guard, for many Indians, alert for anything loose, had gathered quickly during the rescue work. At that point the two <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> guides, <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> and his son, vanished, either because they feared being ducked in some later rapid or they had decided there were too many strange Indians around for comfort. Actually the defection did not matter much, for the two <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> chiefs, <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span>, had already taken over as river guides and ambassadors of good will among the stream-side Indians.</p>
               <p>
What did matter was the way the river was forcing the captains into a familiar dilemma of the Western world: lose time by hurrying. "we should make more portages," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> admitted, "if the season was not so far advanced and time precious with us." They tried to compromise by adding precautions. On approaching an unusually heavy rapid—they were warned either by their <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span> guides or by the deep-throated roar of the water—<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and 
<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would signal for the flotilla to land while they walked ahead with the guides and the steersmen to read the water. If it looked particularly rugged, they would have the nonswimmers walk to the foot of the tail waves, carrying what they could. Men able to swim would then take their chances with the partially lightened craft. Generally no more than one or two boats went through such stretches at a time. This precaution left the others perched in handy eddies, ready to dart out if rescue operations became necessary. As they did—at least five times during the first ten days. "we have great cause to lament," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote after one of the wrecks, while the salvaged goods were drying, "as all our loose Powder two canisters, all our roots prepared in the Indian way, and one half our goods [are lost]." To say nothing of time. <a href="#n1503" id="ln1503" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
As they bobbed and twisted downstream, the nature of the country changed radically. The <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> was breaking out of the last foothills of the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span> and entering the bowl-shaped <span class="tei_name">Columbian Plain</span> in an area where, because of the rain shadow cast by the coastal <span class="tei_name">Cascade Range</span>, precipitation averaged less than ten inches a year. Pine trees disappeared from the hills, as did all vegetation, except stunted willows and weeds, from the stream margins. "Barren and broken" became the common words in the journals for the lands stretching out beyond the canyon walls. Prickly pear cactus covered the wind-scoured ground, but that and spaciousness were the only traits the region shared with the High Plains bordering the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. There were no great, clotted herds of buffalo, elk, deer, or antelope. Food was limited to salmon, most of it dried, and to roots, and a slowly increasing number of dogs, all purchased from the stream-side Indians with articles reluctantly drawn from the expedition's shrinking supply of trade goods.</p>
               <p>
Stalks, twigs, and bits of driftwood served as fuel, and often had to be purchased. The captains, heedful of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> admonition about treating the Indians fairly, were scrupulous about paying for everything that was not clearly offered as a gift. But one night, after yet another wreck had left them cold and hungry and with a canoe-load of sodden goods in need of drying, they did break into a cache of unguarded wood they stumbled across. We know because all the journal keepers admitted to the theft, perhaps to exorcise their guilt by confessing it—or perhaps to help readers understand how dire their straits had become. <a href="#n1504" id="ln1504" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Yet how marvelous those crystal rivers were! Five days out of <span class="tei_name">Canoe Camp</span>, they were hurried by the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> into a stream more than a quarter of a mile wide, its water a faint, translucent green as it surged out of the south. The <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> called it <span class="tei_name">Kimooenim</span>. After recalling his explorations of the <span class="tei_name">Salmon River</span> and remembering his many talks with Indians about the lie of the land, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided this "new" river was actually a reappearance of the <span class="tei_name">Salmon</span>, swollen now by many tributaries. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's River</span>, he had named it—the great South Fork of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> as postulated on their maps.</p>
               <p>
His only mistake was not realizing that <span class="tei_name">Lewis's River</span>, instead of being the main stream, was actually a tributary of the majestic <span class="tei_name">Snake</span>. Right then, however, the error was irrelevant. For as the captains knew from the Indians, a bigger river than the <span class="tei_name">Kimooenim</span> lay only a short distance ahead. This newest one had to be the main fork of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, which the Corps still identified with <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Tacoutche Tesse</span>. Riding a surge like that, they would surely reach the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> in short order. Or so they must have joyfully believed, pleased meanwhile that their guess-work geography, born of many hours of speculation, was turning out to be correct—except in the one vital matter of a short portage across the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>.</p>
               <p>
On October 16, having traveled by <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> calculation 3,714 miles from <span class="tei_name">Camp Wood</span> at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, they reached the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. It was one of the great rivers of North America and a primary goal of the expedition, yet the journals record no elation. The matter-of-factness has baffled some commentators. But exhilaration had come to the explorers two months earlier, after the crossing of <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span>, where most of them, stooping beside a small rivulet, had first "tasted the water of the <span class="tei_name">Great Columbia</span>." This last encounter, however welcome, was no more than a confirmation.</p>
               <p>
Still it merited a halt. The captains wanted to make observations for latitude. (They again sidestepped the tricky calculations involved in computing longitude.) <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was anxious to collect comparative vocabularies, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped to explore upstream toward another tributary he had heard of, today's <span class="tei_name">Yakima</span>. The men needed to mend their clothes and put their arms in order, "always a matter of attention with us," for they never forgot that the expedition was, essentially, a military force crossing lands held by potential enemies. And, as always, they had to replenish their larder as best they could.</p>
               <p>
From time immemorial the junction of the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span> and <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> rivers had been a favorite gathering place for Indians from throughout the <span class="tei_name">Columbian Plain</span>. Topographically, the place was not dramatic, for the river bluffs were low there, affording a view of empty scablands stretching endlessly toward nowhere. But if the land was empty, the river teemed each summer with salmon coming in repeated hordes to the forks. There the fish instinctively chose the branch that would lead them to the headwaters where they had been spawned and where those that survived the journey would spawn in their turn before dying—intense swarms whose pulsing, thrashing magnitude can scarcely be imagined today.</p>
               <p>
When the Corps of Discovery reached the confluence, the last of that year's migration was ending. Though myriads of fish still undulated in transparent water fifteen to twenty feet below the boats, an even greater number lay dead in putrefying windrows along the banks or floated on the surface of the streams. The Indians, too, were leaving. Many of their settlements, frequently located where salmon congregated at the bottoms of the rapids, were empty. But, like the living salmon, many still remained, the men busy with spears, nets, and weirs, while the women dexterously slit in half and disemboweled, one by one, the fish brought to them and then laid the pieces on wooden scaffolds to dry. Amazed by the number of the structures, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> tried to find out how far the people had rafted the timbers used in their building, but his gestured questions, turned into words by <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>, were not understood.</p>
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> soon learned from his vocabulary work, the crowds of Indians in the vicinity all spoke dialects of the same Sahaptian tongue. Meanwhile both captains took note of the unusual houses. They were simple rectangles, fifteen to sixty feet long. Forked timbers supported the ridgepoles; the roof slopes and walls were covered with large mats made of rushes. An open slit along the entire ridge top of each dwelling gave egress to smoke from fires built along the center of the interior. The gap, said <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, "proves to me rains are not common in this country." <a href="#n1505" id="ln1505" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Several families, each with its own fireplace, occupied each house.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> of the foothills, the captains found, were more "dressy" than their relatives at the junction. The former's hide garments were garishly decorated, as were the twin braids of the men's hair, which hung forward over their chests. The women of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> wore belted dresses that reached to their ankles, and they were far more modest than the men about "<span class="italic">secreting the parts</span> [emphasis by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>]." The women downstream, however, eschewed ornaments and long dresses and wore only "a pece of leather tied around them at their hips and drawn tite between their legs and fastened before So as barly to hide those parts which are so sacredly hid &amp; s[e]cured by our women."</p>
               <p>
These benighted people, the captains agreed, seemed happy. They had many horses; the men shared more tasks with women than was customary in most tribes. Monogamy was the rule; age was respected. But there were problems. One widespread affliction was sore eyes and, often, blindness—the result, the captains thought, of the sun's unbroken glare on water during the fishing season and on snow during winter. Many teeth were worn to the gums or missing entirely. The whites explained this by saying the grit of unwashed roots ground away the teeth. More recent theories suggest that both the trachoma and gonorrhea forms of conjunctivitis should bear most of the blame for the ailing eyes, and that sand worn from mortars and pestles during the grinding of food (roots were generally washed, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> notwithstanding) accounted for the bad teeth. <a href="#n1506" id="ln1506" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The Indians returned the whites' curiosity in full. The afternoon the Corps arrived at the confluence, they were greeted by two hundred natives, singing and pounding on their drums. They formed a half-circle around the visitors, smoked a little, and made what they could out of gestures concerning trade and universal peace. Chiefs were "made," and small gifts distributed. Acquiring food from the <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> who lived along the river continued to be an all-important problem. With the greatest politeness, the captains turned down the salmon that were offered them, for they feared some of the fish might have been picked up dead or dying and be contaminated. But they did purchase an amazing heap of forty dogs. Unless the unfortunate creatures were bought already dressed and in individual transactions, the barking, howling, teeth-bared massacre must have been too gruesome even to contemplate.</p>
               <p>
At four o'clock in the afternoon of October 18, the explorers again took to their boats, still accompanied by <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span>. The next day the wide <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, which had been running south, veered west through the <span class="tei_name">Wallula Gap</span> into new canyons. Barren, dark brown cliffs of basalt, the result of ancient lava flows, climbed higher and higher. There were more snarling rapids to run. More Indians to contact, including one group <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> inadvertently frightened out of their wits.</p>
               <p>
The episode occurred near the bottom of a rush of white water two miles long. He and some others walked ahead to lighten the boats for the passage. It turned out to be slow, and to kill time <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> climbed to the top of a two-hundred-foot cliff to see the view. Far to the west he made out, with what must have been a spark of excitement, a tall, snow-covered peak. <span class="tei_name">Mount Saint Helens</span>, he thought, named in 1792 by the British naval captain <span class="tei_name">George Vancouver</span>, who had sighted the mountain from the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. If <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> identification was correct, the continental gap had been closed: two inquiring humans, separated by only a few miles and years, had stared in wonder at the same dazzling object, albeit from different sides. (Actually, the identification was not accurate; <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had sighted a huge new peak later named <span class="tei_name">Mount Adams</span>. <span class="tei_name">Mount Saint Helens</span> was only twenty-five miles farther west, however.) The ocean lay <span class="italic">just yonder</span>, tangible at last. Englishmen had been there; the American <span class="tei_name">Robert Gray</span> had entered the river with his ship <span class="italic">Columbia</span>. But though part of the coast was known, the dark interiors of the land could still be frantically primordial, as <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> learned on his return to meet the boats.</p>
               <p>
The setup was this. The smallest of the dugouts had reached the foot of the rapids, but the larger ones were still upstream, having trouble. Nor was <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> the only watcher. Across the river from where he settled down to wait were five long houses. Their inhabitants, who evidently had not noticed <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as he descended the cliffs, were scattered out on ledges, staring at the fleet. At that point <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> half-negligently snapped a shot at a crane flying over- 
head, barely visible against fleecy clouds. A lucky hit: the bird dropped with a puff of feathers into the river. Instantly the Indians across the way, who never before had heard a gun, fled in panic into their long houses.</p>
               <p>
Not connecting the incidents but wanting to keep all Indians on a friendly footing, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called to <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Field brothers</span>, who were waiting nearby. Boarding the small boat, they rowed across the river. Along the way <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> shot at a duck. It, too, fell into the river.</p>
               <p>
Arrived at the closest house, the whites shoved aside the upright mats that blocked the doors and entered. Abject terror greeted them. Thirty-two men, women, and children crouched on the floor, heads hanging as they wailed and moaned and wrung their hands. The thought crossed <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> mind that he could go among them tomahawking each in turn without encountering resistance. <a href="#n1507" id="ln1507" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> It was an instinctive, bloodthirsty reaction born in his own dark, unexplored interior, and psychologists might like to play with it. In the event, however, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> simply took each person by the hand and offered trinkets and bits of ribbon. As the people calmed, he sent his men to the other lodges to repeat the performance.</p>
               <p>
To seal the peace, he produced his pipe and loaded it with tobacco prior to passing it around for a ceremonial smoke. Sunlight falling through the slit in the roof led him to light the tobacco with a burning (magnifying) glass—no pocket matches in those days. At that the terror returned full force. Fire drawn by a demi-god from the sun!</p>
               <p>
Realizing what he had done, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> retreated outside and sat on a rock, holding the pipe in a welcoming position. No one ventured out, however, until <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> arrived with <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span>. The two <span class="tei_name">Nez Percés</span> jabbered questions. The Indians explained. They had heard roars like thunder; dead birds had fallen from the sky. Clearly the white man was from the sun. <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> clucked. No, this was the way of it. But what really wiped the fears away was the sight of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> coming up the hill with her eight-month-old <span class="tei_name">son</span> in his carrier on her back. "This ... confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter." <a href="#n1508" id="ln1508" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
As the miles fell away, the desolation of the land increased. The lava-rock precipices, particularly those bordering the north side of the river, climbed hundreds of feet high. Over the eons they had shed huge chunks of basalt into the water. These dark, forbidding rocks split the river into many fretful channels, some stirred in places by whirlpools as if with a giant spoon. And these were but preludes. From the natives the explorers kept hearing the word <span class="italic">timm</span>, spoken in deep tones to imitate the roar of unseen falls ahead. As for the Indians, most continued to be of Sahaptian stock—<span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> and their relatives. Here and there, however, the whites began coming across squat, unkempt, loose-haired, bandy-legged members of the Chinookan language group.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> were true flatheads. Foreheads, molded when infant bones were soft, sloped backward without indentation from the tip of the nose to a pointed cranium. Protrusions at the back of the head were also flattened out, to intensify the peaked-head look that among the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> signified beauty and nobility. Two or three of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> had blankets of red and blue cloth; one wore a sailor's jacket. The articles clearly came 
from the mouth of the river. But did the whites who had traded the merchandise live in permanent posts, as the Indians seemed to indicate, or did they simply make occasional visits by ship to the coast? At that point the destitute explorers probably did not care greatly either way, so long as ship or post, even if manned by Britons, was well stocked with supplies.</p>
               <p>
On October 22, after speeding down a roaring channel between the south shore and a long island spiked with fantastic towers and pinnacles of basalt, they came to the brink of a massive, perpendicular, twenty-foot waterfall—<span class="italic">timm</span> water, shrouded in mist. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> felt any resurgence of the awe that had gripped him at the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri</span>, it is not mentioned. Nor does <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reveal anything more than a concern to get on down the river as efficiently as possible. Aesthetics and adventure were losing their savor. <a href="#n1509" id="ln1509" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Because this was a heavily traveled Indian route, the captains had no trouble planning procedures. Accompanied by an old Indian, they located a rough, twelve-hundred-foot portage across solid rock and windblown sand. By hiring a few horses for transporting the heaviest bundles and letting the men carry the rest, they completed moving their cargo by nightfall and camped near "5 lod[g]es of natives drying and prepareing fish for market."</p>
               <p>
The steep, winding route would not do for the heavy dugouts, however. So the next morning <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the greater part of the men rowed the boats to the south side of the river and, with great difficulty, "hauled" them a quarter of a mile through the debris of a recently abandoned fishing camp. The fleas swarming there infested the men. Frantic, they tore off their hide clothing and worked naked so they could brush away the vermin as opportunity allowed. They could not abandon their overrun clothing, however, for they had nothing else to wear. So they took the fleas with them on a swift ride through a narrow channel that ended at the top of a snarling cascade whose total drop was about eight feet. The pitching banks allowed no room for portaging big dugouts, and the tremendous surge of the water created a maelstrom unsafe for the men to ride. Finding perches on rocks above the fury, the men lined the empty craft through with elkskin ropes. One broke loose and was pounced on by Indians waiting below the falls; ransoming the boat was costly. The full drop of falls and cataracts, a unit later called <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>, was, by <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> calculations, thirty-eight and a half feet.</p>
               <p>
Another bit of foresight here. In a back eddy below the falls the captains saw two beautiful canoes different from any they had witnessed before. Tapering gracefully at both ends, they were unusually wide in the middle. Their sides, "dug thin" in <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> words, were strengthened by crossbars; these also served as handles for lifting the relatively light vessels out of the water onto the shore. The bows were decorated by fanciful figureheads. Such 
canoes, they learned through their <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span> interpreters, were constructed to ride high waves and carry huge burdens. Since the Corps dugouts most assuredly could not do those things, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> sought out the owner of one of the vessels and, after much bargaining, obtained it in exchange for the expedition's small dugout plus a hatchet and some trinkets. <a href="#n1510" id="ln1510" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
A couple of miles below <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>, a massive black promontory thrust into the stream as if trying to touch a shorter span on the opposite bank. Accompanied by several Indians who lived near the obstruction, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> climbed to its top to study what he later called the <span class="tei_name">Short Narrows</span>. It was awesome—the entire <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> pouring into a gap forty-five yards wide as if into a high-pressure nozzle. Yet avoiding the stretch by portaging the heavy dugouts across the steep, broad obstruction was impossible.</p>
               <p>
After studying "this agitated gut swelling, boiling &amp; whorling in every direction," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span>, the principal boatman, decided it could be run. Presumably the captains sent all nonswimmers, including <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and her baby, and the most valuable goods around the cauldron. <span class="italic">But</span> he doesn't say so, as he does every other time the group is divided, and the exception tantalizes. Did <span class="italic">everyone</span> run the gut—a rougher run, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> admitted later, than he had anticipated and one that amazed the Indians watching from the rocks above? After clearing the agitated whorls, the boats raced on through a slightly wider slot to a "very bad place, the current divided by two islands." <span class="italic">There</span>, at the <span class="tei_name">Short Narrows</span>, nonswimmers did carry the expedition's most valuable "papers Guns &amp;  amunition" by land while the dugouts took on the "very bad place" without casualties.</p>
               <p>
Between the <span class="tei_name">Short Narrows</span> and the next rapid, which <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> named the <span class="tei_name">Long Narrows</span>, stood a strong village of <span class="tei_name">Wishram</span> Indians, a <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> band. Called <span class="tei_name">Nixluidix</span>, the town consisted of twenty-one long, plank houses, their foundations dug deeply into the earth—the first wooden town the captains had seen since leaving the <span class="tei_name">Illinois</span> country. Along with a settlement of related <span class="tei_name">Wascos</span> located on the southern shore (a village the captains did not visit),
<span class="tei_name">Nixluidix</span> dominated the twelve-mile stretch of furious water later named <span class="tei_name">La Grande Dalle de la Columbia</span>, or, more simply, <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>. <a href="#n1511" id="ln1511" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
               </p>

From mid-April to mid-October, salmon of several species could be taken in almost unlimited numbers as they struggled upward toward their spawning grounds. Cleaned, dried, and pounded into a powder, the catches were stored in big baskets lined with fish skins. The storage baskets were then stacked in pyramids, seven below and five above. Mats were wrapped around the stacks and cinched tight with cords. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> counted 107 stacks scattered around the environs of <span class="tei_name">Nixluidix</span>—by his estimate, ten thousand pounds of "neet" fish (fish unmixed with other substances). The fish meal, he was assured, would stay edible for several years and was a principal source of winter food. The odorous region—fish entrails, excrement, and decay in general—also attracted innumerable fleas and polecats. <a href="#n1512" id="ln1512" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Nez Percés</span> and other Sahaptian groups from higher up the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> came to the area to increase their own supplies of fish and also to swap their furs, hides, bear claws, bear grass (used in making baskets), and dried meat with <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> visitors for dried clams, tools whittled out of wood, cloth and metal items from ship traders who stopped by the <span class="tei_name">Columbia's</span> mouth, and choice dentalium shells that trickled south along the coast from <span class="tei_name">Vancouver
Island</span>. The shells were about two inches long and curved like tiny walrus tusks. <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> liked to wear them in their noses, and a few <span class="tei_name">Nez Percés</span> imitated the custom, just as some Sahaptians flattened their children's heads according to the Chinookan style. Other exchanges at the great mart consisted of folk stories, dances, and whatever was staked on the interminable gambling games.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Wascos and Wishrams</span> who lived along <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> were as intent on retaining control of the Indian commerce that flowed through their part of the gorge as the <span class="tei_name">Teton Sioux</span> had been in mastering the trade of the middle <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Of the two groups at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Wishrams</span> were the more belligerent, and it was among them that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> camped during their descent of the river. The Indians were suspicious. Just what did these strangers want? According to <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span>, the villagers were even planning to attack the expedition. No problem, the captains said, but made a show of examining the men's arms and issuing enough ammunition to give each soldier a hundred rounds.</p>
               <p>
Evidently the demonstration had its effect. The Indians became civil. With <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span> acting as representatives of the <span class="tei_name">Nez Percés</span>, the captains arranged a peace between the tribes. Pax Americana, just what <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span> wanted, even out here where his nation exerted no sovereignty—as yet. From this moment on, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote with astounding naiveté, "those two bands or nations will be on the most friendly terms." In celebration <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span> fiddled and the soldiers danced, to the delight of the natives.</p>

            <div class="section  tei_div">

On October 25, the explorers successfully passed the <span class="tei_name">Long Narrows</span>, boiling and whirling just below the <span class="tei_name">Wishram</span> settlements. The thirty-five miles of relatively quiet water that followed served to take them out of the arid <span class="tei_name">Columbian Plain</span> into the humid rain forests of the coastal Northwest. The change was extraordinary. Average annual rainfall (which of course the explorers had no way of measuring) rises from fourteen inches at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> to sixty-five inches—more than five feet!—on the western slope of the <span class="tei_name">Cascade Mountains</span>. Under the influence of the repeated deluges, the stunted pines and oak coverts the explorers had noticed at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> gave way to Douglas firs, red cedars, spruce and hemlock of unbelievable size. Rioting underneath the high canopy of the branches were almost impenetrable tangles of lesser trees, brush, and giant ferns.</p>
               <p>
The Indians changed too. The <span class="tei_name">Eneeshur</span> band of Sahaptians, who lived near <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>, could not understand the <span class="tei_name">Echeloot Wishrams</span> who lived only half a dozen miles away. <a href="#n1513" id="ln1513" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Although salmon were an important part of the economy of the Sahaptians, and especially of the <span class="tei_name">Nez Percé</span>, their chief orientation was toward the grassy, untimbered land where their horse herds ranged. In the thick forests west of the <span class="tei_name">Cascade Mountains</span>, however, horses were useless. The <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> were people of the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> littoral and of its great rivers, and of fantastic canoes that were capable of riding across waves that would keep the cumbersome log dugouts of the Americans pinned to the shore for days at a time. They were a people of wood. They built plank houses covered with riven fir and cedar; they carved not only domestic utensils from the produce of the forest but also decorative figureheads for their boats and curious images of human forms to set up beside their wooden burial vaults. <a href="#n1514" id="ln1514" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> distrusted them. Part of the prejudice came from <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and Tetoharsky, who accompanied the expedition through the <span class="tei_name">Short</span> and <span class="tei_name">Long Narrows</span> with great reluctance and then hurried home on horses they had purchased near <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>. One of the duties of the Corps, however, was to be friendly, so they could acquire, through observation and pantomime, knowledge that might some day be useful to their country. For themselves they needed to create a good will they could draw on while toiling back up the river the following spring. <a href="#n1515" id="ln1515" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Each day, accordingly, they smoked with most of the groups they encountered on the river, and at night entertained neighborhood villagers with the well-tested devices of fiddle music, the soldiers' dancing, <span class="tei_name">York's</span> exuberant jigging, and demonstrations of the airgun. They also needed to buy fish meal and edible dogs from the people they met, and so the underlying antipathy they felt did not surface visibly until they had reached the discomforts of the lower river.</p>
               <p>
The transition into wetness was complete by the time the Corps reached the infamous rapids that became known, during immigrant days, as the Upper and Lower <span class="tei_name">Cascades of the Columbia</span>—rapids that gave their name to the mountain range through which the river bored. (Today those once powerful and startlingly beautiful waters are buried underneath the reservoir backed up by <span class="tei_name">Bonneville Dam</span>.) Like the <span class="tei_name">Short</span> and <span class="tei_name">Long Narrows</span> higher upstream, both Cascades were compression rapids, the confined waters rushing "in a most horriable manner" among a clutter of 
boulders "both large and small." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> promptly named the Upper Cascade the <span class="tei_name">Great Shute</span> (<span class="italic">sic</span>).</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Great Shute</span> was so formidable that the captains decided they would have to portage the dugouts as well as the cargo around it. They accomplished the difficult feat by having the men place poles across the ragged crevices between the boulders littering the shore and then skidding the heavy boats across the timbers. The work, handicapped by rain and slippery footing, was so onerous that on reaching the Lower Cascade they decided to portage only their shrunken packs of merchandise and equipment and again risk the empty dugouts to the white turbulence. All five slammed through right side up.</p>
               <p>
A briefly joyful climax rewarded them. Just beyond the bottom of the last rapid, under the shadow of a stone pillar almost nine hundred feet high called <span class="tei_name">Beacon Rock</span>, they encountered the first tides of the ocean they were striving to reach. It would come as a shock to learn, gradually, that in spite of the fluctuations, the sea was still more than a hundred miles away.</p>
               <p>
They were miserable miles, even though the confining mountains soon gave way, in a stretch where the river ran northward, to broad, almost level forests broken by occasional prairies. For the days were short, fogs common, rains all but unending. Curious, light-fingered Indians were everywhere, some in high-prowed canoes that put the whites' clumsy dugouts to shame, others on the flat, tree-covered islands that dotted the widening river or in clearings on the shore. The natives carried guns, swords, sailors' clothing, copper and brass trinkets, and other articles that could have reached them only through white traders. And some of those traders, the Indians kept insisting, insofar as the Americans could read their gestures, lived in houses near the mouth of the river. <a href="#n1516" id="ln1516" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The increasing ambivalence with which the two races regarded each other became evident on November 4, on what is now <span class="tei_name">Sauvie Island</span> near present-day <span class="tei_name">Portland</span>. (The Corps was skirting the north shore of the big island; as a result they did not see the many-channeled mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Willamette River</span>, which enters the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> from the south.) During the morning they landed at a village of twenty-five long houses. On the shore in front of the houses were fifty-two canoes, many very large and high in the bow. The inhabitants consisted of two hundred male <span class="tei_name">Skilloots</span> and their families, one of the many <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> bands. "We were treated very kindly by them," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote, "they gave us round root near the size of a hens egg roasted which they call <span class="italic">Wap-to</span> to eat." This was a happy introduction to a food more commonly spelled wapatoo (and known to later immigrants as swamp potato) that would serve the travelers well throughout the winter.</p>
               <p>
After purchasing four bushels of the roots, the Corps went on several miles before pausing to eat. Hard behind them came several canoe-loads of armed <span class="tei_name">Skilloots</span> dressed in garish combinations of sailor clothing and native garb. This meeting was not as pleasant as the earlier one. The Indians, who were armed, were "assumeing and disagreeable, however we Smoked with them and treated them with every attention &amp; friendship." Taking advantage of the hospitality, the visitors adroitly purloined <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> pipe tomahawk and a capote belonging to one of the interpreters. At that the captains' tempers slipped the leash. While the soldiers held their rifles at ready, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> searched both the persons and boats of the Indians.</p>
               <p>
In the captains' minds the effrontery was justified. "Finding us determined not to suffer any imposition . . . they showed their displeasure in the only way which they dared, by retreating in an ill humor to their village." But were the Indians pilfering as the word is defined by property-conscious Anglo-Saxons? Apologists say no and argue that the Indians were not appropriating the articles for personal gain, but to force the whites to notice them and enter into what one commentator calls "mutually rewarding reciprocal relations." All the Indians wanted was honest payment for the use of their territory, the theory holds. <a href="#n1517" id="ln1517" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
On November 7, three days and roughly eighty river miles from the <span class="tei_name">Skilloot</span> town, the explorers entered a broad indentation on the north side of the river. By then the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, flowing mostly west again, was penetrating the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Coast</span> Range. The gentle banks that had prevailed farther upstream were gone. In their place were "high rugid hills with Steep assent the shore boalt [bold] and rockey, the fog so thick we could not See across the river." The tide was in, islands were numerous; without a hired Indian pilot, the travelers would have had difficulty finding the proper channel. (They also bought three dogs, some wapatoo roots, and salmon at the pilot's home village.) In the afternoon the fog lifted partially, though a light rain persisted, and they saw the great river of the West widening into what seemed an endless expanse of water. "Great joy in camp," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote. "we are in <span class="italic">view</span> of the <span class="italic">Ocian</span> ... the great <span class="tei_name">Pacific Octean</span> which we have been so long anxious to See, and the roreing or noise made by the waves brakeing on the rockey Shores (as I suppose) may be heard distictly."</p>
               <p>
Technically he was wrong. Those waves were breaking on the steep shores of <span class="tei_name">Gray's Bay</span>, and the ocean was still about twenty direct-line miles away. And yet psychologically <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was right. <span class="tei_name">Gray's Bay</span> had been named for the American ship captain <span class="tei_name">Robert Gray</span>, who, on the bright spring morning of May 11, 1792, had entered the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and a little later had anchored in that bay, the first white man to do so. <a href="#n1518" id="ln1518" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> On entering the same bay from the east, the first whites to do so, the Corps of Discovery was finally tying the middle section of North America together.</p>
               <p>
There were other reasons to celebrate. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had long since given up their initial plan, expressed in a letter of early April to <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span>, of returning at least as far as the headwaters of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> before going into winter quarters. Now they were thinking in terms of the lower river. If a settlement, even a British 
settlement, did exist near the <span class="tei_name">Columbia's</span> mouth, as they understood the Indians to say, many of the problems of wintering in the storm-swept land, among natives of unpredictable moods, would be largely solved. If there was no settlement, as the captains were inclined to believe, at least a trading ship was likely to appear—perhaps the one commanded by a Captain Haley, whose name was well and favorably known to the Indians. They could replenish their alarmingly depleted store of trade goods; they could send messages, specimens, and copies of their journals to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, as he had requested. Above all, they would have the satisfaction of talking to others of their own kind, and of learning, in the language of home, what had been going on in the distant world during their long absence.</p>
               <p>
And so there was joy in camp.</p>
               <p>
Premature joy, as events developed. Because of frenzied weather and booming tides, they never did get their canoes to the river's mouth. Half of the group never did stand on the great north headland known as <span class="tei_name">Cape Disappointment</span> and look across the white-capped rollers that were pounding toward the coast, uninterrupted, all the way from the Kuril Islands north of Japan.</p>
               <p>
The miseries began in the very camp from which they peered with such joy at what they supposed was the ocean. The shore was so narrow they escaped high tide only by spreading their sleeping mats on heaps of round stones at the edge of the forest—in the rain, inevitably. The next day, November 8, they crept along the shore for a meager eight miles. The waves were high. The dugouts twisted and sheared and bobbed. Many of the crew—<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> listed 
<span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>, <span class="tei_name">Peter Wiser</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>—vomited in agonized seasickness over the sides of the dugouts they were in. (What of the baby? No one says.) Giving up finally, they camped on a narrow shingle between the water and a hill too steep and brushy for the hunters to ascend in search of food.</p>
               <p>
That night the roar of the rising tide awakened them. Scrambling to the dugouts, they unloaded them in the rain-swept darkness and boosted the baggage onto log platforms. The next day they spent struggling to keep the tossing boats from being crushed by gale-driven driftwood trees two hundred feet long and up to seven feet thick. But, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> said, the men were still cheerful, thinking of the nearby ocean. <a href="#n1519" id="ln1519" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Whenever the gales slackened briefly during the next several days, the explorers reloaded the dugouts and rowed toward the next bay to the west—<span class="tei_name">Baker's Bay</span>, named by <span class="tei_name">George Vancouver's</span> men for a trader who had entered the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> only a few weeks behind <span class="tei_name">Robert Gray</span>. Trading ships often anchored there, or so the whites understood from Indian gestures. They might even find the rumored settlement. But the approach was blocked by a cliff-sided 
promontory later named <span class="tei_name">Point Ellice</span>. (<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> labeled it <span class="tei_name">Point Dismal</span> on his sketch map.) Each time the dugouts neared the obstruction, screaming winds and heavy seas drove them back to a landing that seemed worse than the one before. In one place they had to build their fires and lay their beds on a driftwood raft that during high tide was "all on flote." In another place they sought to protect their canoes from the waves by filling them with rocks and sinking them.</p>
               <p>
For eleven days and nights rain fell almost ceaselessly. Elkskin clothing and moccasins rotted. Tents and sails were in tatters. The Corps's merchandise, which was their only bank account, was constantly soaked and much was spoiled. Only occasionally were they able to spear a few salmon, shoot a few waterfowl, or buy a few roots from passing Indians. Otherwise they made their meals from the dry, pounded, tasteless fish they had laid by for emergencies far back at <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>. They watched enviously as the Indians rode as easily as gulls over the towering waves—"the best Canoe navigaters I ever Saw," <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote. Resentment and frustration filled him: "the most disgreeable time I have experienced confined to a tempiest [tempestuous] coast wet, where I can neither git out 
to hunt, return to a better situation, or proceed on." <a href="#n1520" id="ln1520" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Gradually, though, they did proceed. First <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and a small advance party managed to break around <span class="tei_name">Point Dismal</span> into the eastern part of <span class="tei_name">Baker's Bay</span>. From there they could see the full expanse of the five-mile-wide ocean gateway between <span class="tei_name">Cape Disappointment</span> on the north and <span class="tei_name">Point Adams</span> on the south. <a href="#n1521" id="ln1521" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Neither town nor ship was visible. But some of the beaches, though windswept, were broad and sandy. An abandoned Indian settlement of thirty-six plank houses stood nearby; the ruins were full of fleas, but the Corps could take away enough boards to build shelters at a safe distance. Also nearby were two camps of Indians who called themselves <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span>—the first meeting of either captain with the dominant tribe of the area and one whose name soon spread generically to related bands speaking the same language. After sending a suggestion to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that the Corps move to this propitious spot as wind and tides allowed, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> continued west—on foot, because the waves rolling in from the sea were rougher than he wanted to attempt by boat. His intent: to investigate the bays on the coast north of <span class="tei_name">Cape Disappointment</span> (<span class="tei_name">Vancouver's</span> chart showed at least one) for possible ships and/or winter quarters.</p>
               <p>
By the evening of the 16th, the rest of the Corps were ashore in <span class="tei_name">Baker's Bay</span>, at a location northwest across the river from the present city of <span class="tei_name">Astoria</span>, <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>. The men worked busily at creating the first decent camp, relatively speaking, they had lived in for more than a week. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party rejoined the main group on the 17th, morale was up again.</p>
               <p>
Who else wanted a closeup view of the ocean that had been their goal across two-thirds of a continent? <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>, born explorer and mapmaker, certainly did. He told all who wished to go with him to be ready at daylight on the 18th. At the appointed time he started hiking with <span class="tei_name">Sergeants Pryor</span> and <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>; <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wiser</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Bratton</span>; <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, and <span class="tei_name">York</span>. <span class="tei_name">Joseph and Reuben Field</span>, who had been with <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party, went along for 
a second look. The rest of the Corps stayed put; they could see all the salt water they wanted from their new camp.</p>
               <p>
After climbing to the rocky top of the cape and watching, in astonishment, giant breakers exploding against the cliffs, they turned north. They walked and slept in intermittent rains, crashed through brush, traversed grassy slopes, and carved their names on trees, as their predecessors had done. <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span> shot a condor with an amazing wingspan of nine and a half feet. <span class="tei_name">Reuben's</span> brother, <span class="tei_name">Joe</span>, killed a hitherto unknown species of black-tailed deer;
it provided, on the morning of the 19th, "a Sumptious brackfest of Venison which was roasted on Stiks exposed to the fire." That same day <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> named a distant, striking height of land "after my particular friend <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>." Today it is known as North Head. They saw no ships, although they undoubtedly scanned the ocean's misty face as closely as <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> group had.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps they wondered, as some later critics have, why <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span> did not send a ship to succor them. <a href="#n1522" id="ln1522" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Yet why should he have? Supposedly the expedition had left <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> with all the equipment it needed. On April 7, 1805, at the time of departing from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had written <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> that he expected to reach the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> and return at least as far as the headwaters of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> before winter set in. He had said nothing about being short of supplies. Schedules could go awry, of course; indeed, the Corps might never reach the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. In view of those uncertainties, exactly when should a reinforcing ship appear off the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>? And would a Congress speckled with <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> political enemies authorize outfitting a vessel—an expensive undertaking for an administration that trumpeted of economy—to circle <span class="tei_name">Cape Horn</span> on so tenuous a mission? Sensing these deterrents long in advance, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had provided <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> with the only reasonable escape available: the right to contact whatever trading vessels he saw for whatever he needed, even to returning home on one if such proved necessary.</p>
               <p>
The right, however, did not bring a vessel with it. That being true, what should be done now?</p>
               <p>
Making the decision seems to have plagued the captains more than any other problem they had faced so far. They hated to give up all hope of a vessel, and yet they could not stay in this estuary, exposed to an endless sequence of storms. A week's hard experience had showed them that they could not count on their guns to provide them with the food they needed, yet they did not have enough merchandise left to buy a winter's supply of food from the hard-bargaining Indians.</p>
               <p>
If they did not stay, where should they go? The men who accompanied <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to the coast expressed a desire to winter near <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>. <a href="#n1523" id="ln1523" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> The climate there would be dry—but cold and short of the kind of large animals from which clothing could be made. Another possibility was the <span class="tei_name">Sandy River</span>, which drained off <span class="tei_name">Mount Hood</span> into the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> a little west of the Lower Cascade. Meadows broke the forests there; deer would probably abound and the climate would be mild.</p>
               <p>
So there was talk. Yet after <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned to the <span class="tei_name">Baker's Bay</span> camp a little after midday on November 20, the days went by as though nothing serious pressed on anyone's mind. The captains made chiefs and distributed medals among the canoe-borne Indians who kept coming in and out despite a ferocious new storm. (<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> simply could not reconcile himself to such weather: "O! how horriable is the day waves brakeing with great violence against the Shore throwing the water into our camp &amp;c. all wet and confined to our Shelters.") Red traders, impervious to the deluge in conical hats tightly woven of split twigs, hawked their wares. Both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> yearned for a luxurious robe of otter skins that one Indian would sell only for more blue beads, a valued medium of exchange throughout the Northwest, than the Americans could afford to dip out of the expedition's skimpy supply. Eventually they solved the problem by persuading <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> to part with a belt of blue beads she habitually wore around her waist; in return they gave her a blue cloth coat that was more adaptable than her buffalo-skin robe.</p>
               <p>
Another trade article in great demand was produced by a <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> madam, wife of a chief, who showed up with six of her daughters and nieces "for the purpose of gratifying the passions of our men." <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diary entries for November 21 grew puritanical. The young women's countenances, he admitted grudgingly, were pretty—if one ignored their slanted foreheads. But they were short of stature, their hair hung loose and long, they had "large swelled legs &amp; thighs." Their limbs were tattooed. Venereal scabs were plain on some of them. They "sport openly with our men." But there was no use objecting: "we divided some ribin between our men . . . to bestow on their favorite Lasses, this plan to save the knives &amp; more valueable articles."</p>
               <p>
What finally ended the indecision was the arrival, late on November 23, of seven <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> traders from the south side of the river. Undisturbed by the whites' refusal to buy the furs they offered for sale, the Indians cheerfully suggested their own territory as winter quarters. Over yonder, their gestures said, elk abounded, a source of food and of skins for clothing. The ocean and the <span class="tei_name">Columbia's</span> estuary were close by. The first meant the whites could prepare salt to improve the taste of their food. The second would allow them to contact, through the Indians, any trading vessel that dropped anchor in the river's protected bays. The one obvious drawback would be living for months in the dreadful weather, as the newcomers considered it, of the coast.</p>
               <p>Reluctant to impose their own preferences on the men—nothing could be more damaging to already shaky morale—the captains called for a vote from everyone, soldiers, interpreters, black <span class="tei_name">York</span> and red <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>. A few favored going to <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>; more 
declared for <span class="tei_name">Sandy River</span>. But the majority followed the captains in choosing the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> lands, with this qualification: if, after an examination, hunting and living conditions proved inadequate, they could move up the river. <a href="#n1524" id="ln1524" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the 25th they started out. Not daring to risk the broad estuary in their log dugouts, they labored upstream to a narrower spot, crossed, and crept back along the shore to <span class="tei_name">Tongue Point</span>, a promontory about four miles long but only fifty yards wide at its narrowest section. They had succeeded in rowing around this obstruction when a new storm pinned them to its exposed ocean side.</p>
               <p>
On the 29th <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, always impatient, broke loose. The big dugouts might not be able to handle the huge swells, but the small Indian canoe he had purchased at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> could. Accompanied by <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>, <span class="tei_name">Colter</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shannon</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span>, he explored the coast of what <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would later name <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Bay (now Young's Bay)</span> in his honor. After considerable trial and error, he found an inlet into which the <span class="tei_name">Netul River</span> flowed. (Today it is the <span class="tei_name">Lewis and Clark River</span>.) The party followed its windings through marshy ground thick with small trees and brush, a mix they called "slashes." The knolls rising out of the slashes supported much larger evergreens, and when they came to one whose top was some thirty feet above high tide level and when they saw elk tracks everywhere around it, they decided this would do for their winter camp. On the morning of December 5, three of them started back to summon the others. Two stayed behind to hunt. Nothing was said, at least in the journals, about a two-or three-week examination before a final choice was made. <a href="#n1525" id="ln1525" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
Waiting for <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> return was another doleful experience for <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span>. Winds strong enough to blow down trees raged through the camp. Thick smoke from wet fuel hurt <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> eyes. The roar of the sea depressed him more and more. It had assaulted his ears for "24 days Since we arrived in Sight of the Great Western; (for I cannot say <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>) Ocian as I have not seen one pacific day . . . [just] emenc waves . . . tempestous and horiable." <a href="#n1526" id="ln1526" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Though there were elk in the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Tongue Point</span>, the hunters were rarely able to bring down one of the animals as they raced away among the thick trees and through the pelting rain. Except for occasional hawks and waterfowl, their food again was fish meal boiled in salty water dipped from the ocean side of the point. Digestive disturbances left <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and some of the men too unwell to eat even that. Deciding the salt water was to blame, he directed the cooks to use fresh water from the upper side of the point. It helped, he thought.</p>
               <p>
During the days of waiting he wandered around the vicinity, observing plants and wildlife and faithfully recording what he saw. It seems likely, too, that he passed some of the time reading from <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie's</span> account of his own crossing of the continent, with its climactic lines, "I now mixed up some vermilion, in melted grease, and inscribed, in large characters, on the South-East side of the rock on which we had slept, this brief memorial—'<span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span>, from <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>, by land, the twenty-second of July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three.' "</p>
               <p>
With that in mind the American found a large tree and carved into its bark, "<span class="tei_name">Capt William Clark</span> December 3rd 1805. By Land. U. States in 1804–05." In thus imitating <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>, he may have only been reassuring himself in his doldrums. Or he may have been announcing to all who read his words, which he copied in his journal, that <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie's</span> feat had been matched. Or the lines may have carried implications of national sovereignty to come, as <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie's</span> most certainly had.</p>
               <p>
Or perhaps all three motives were involved. Today there is no way to be sure.</p>

These layers cracked into pieces that looked like flagstones (<span class="italic">dalles</span>) to French voyageurs who, after <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> time, took boats through the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> narrows for Canadian trading companies. Hence by association the rough-water stretch became known as <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>—a name applied to several other North American rapids. Still later, <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>, as a name, slid downstream to a mission station located just below the narrows.
