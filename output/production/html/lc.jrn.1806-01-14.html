This morning the Sergt. of the Guard reported the absence of one of the large perogues, it had broken the chord by which it was attatched and the tide had taken it off; we sent a party immediately in surch of her, they returned in about 3 hours having fortunately found her.    we now directed three of the perogues to be drawn up out of reach of the tide and the fourth to be mored in the small branch just above the landing and confined with a strong rope of Elk-skin.    had we lost this perogue also we should have been obliged to make three small ones, which with the few tools we have now left would be a serious undertaking.    a fatieuge of 6 men employed injerking the Elk beaf.</p>

This morning the Serjt. of the guard reported the absence of one of our Canoes    it had broken the Cord by which it was attached and the tide had taken her off; we Sent a party imediately in Serch of her, they returned in about 3 hours haveing fortunately found her.    we now derect that 3 of the [canoes] be drawed up out of reach of the tide and the 4th to be tied with a long Strong Cord of Elk Skins, ready for use.    had we lost this large Canoe we Should have been obliged to make 3 other Small ones, which with the fiew tools we have now left would be a Serious undertakeing.    a fatiege of Six men employd in jurking the Elk beef.

The persons who usially visit the enterence of this river for the purpose of traffic or hunting, I believe is either English or Americans; the Indians inform us that they Speak the Same language with our Selves, and gave us proofs of their varacity by repeating maney words of English, Sun of a pitch &amp;c.
