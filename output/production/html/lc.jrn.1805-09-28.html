                  <em class="hi">Saturday 28th.</em>    We had a pleasant morning and all hands, that were able, employed at the canoes.— Game is very scarce, and our hunters unable to kill any meat. We are therefore obliged to live on fish and roots, that we procure from the natives; and which do not appear a suitable diet for us. Salt also is scarce without which fish is but poor and insipid. Our hunters killed nothing to day.
