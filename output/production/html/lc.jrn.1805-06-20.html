This morning we had but little to do; waiting the return of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a>; I am apprehensive from his stay that the portage is longer than we had calculated on. I sent out 4 hunters this morning on the opposite side of the river to kill buffaloe; the country being more broken on that side and cut with ravenes they can get within shoot of the buffaloe with more ease and certainty than on this side of the river.    my object is if possible while we have now but little to do, to lay in a large stock of dryed meat at this end of the portage to subsist the party while engaged in the transportation of our baggage &amp;c, to the end, that they may not be taken from this duty when once commenced in order to surch for the necessary subsistence. <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">The Indian woman</a> is qute free from pain and fever this morning and appears to be in a fair way for recovery, she has been walking about and fishing. In the evening 2 of the hunters returned and informed me that they had killed eleven buffaloe eight of which were in very fine order, I sent off all hands immediately to bring in the meat    they soon returned with about half of the best meat leaving three men to remain all night in order to secure the ballance.    the buffaloe are in immence numbers, they have been constantly coming down in large herds to water opposite to us for some hours sometimes two or three herds wartering at the same instant and scarcely disappear before others supply their places.     they appear to make great use of the mineral water, whether this be owing to it's being more convenient to them than the river or that they actually prefer it I am at a loss to determine for they do not use it invaryably, but sometimes pass at no great distance from it and water at the river.    brackish water or that of a dark colour impregnated with mineral salts such as I have frequenly mentioned on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> is found in small quantities in some of the steep ravenes on the N. side of the river opposite to us and <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">the falls</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

               <p>We had a heavy dew this morning.    the Clouds near those mountains rise Suddonly and discharge their Contents partially on the neighbouring Plains; the Same Cloud discharge hail alone in one part, hail and rain in another and rain only in a third all within the Space of a fiew Miles; and on the Mountains to the South &amp; S.

               <p>I do not believe that the Clouds that pervale at this Season of the year reach the Summits of those lofty mountains; and if they do the probabillty is that they deposit Snow only for there has been no proceptable diminution of the Snow which they Contain Since we first Saw them.

               <p>Dureing the time of my being on the Plains and above the falls I as also all my party repeatedly heard a nois which proceeded from a Direction a little to the N. of West, as loud and resembling precisely the discharge of a piece of ordinance of 6 pounds at the distance of 5 or six miles. <a href="#n15062004" id="ln15062004" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> I was informed of it Several times by the men <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">J.

I have no doubt but if I had leasure I could find from whence it issued. I have thought it probable that it might be caused by running water in Some of the caverns of those emence mountains, on the principal of the <a class="regularization" title="Blowing Cave" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Blowing%20Cave">blowing caverns</a>; <a href="#n15062005" id="ln15062005" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> but in Such case the Sounds would be periodical and regular, which is not the Case with this, being Sometimes heard once only and at other times Several discharges in quick Succession.    it is heard also at different times of the day and night.
