I observe no difference between the liquorice of this country and that common to many parts of the United States where it is also sometimes cultivated in our gardens.    this plant delights in a deep loose sandy soil; here it grows very abundant and large; the natives roast it in the embers and pound it slightly with a small stick in order to make it seperate more readily from the strong liggament which forms the center of the root; this the natives discard and chew and swallow the ballance of the root; this last is filled with a number of thin membrenacious lamela like net work, too tough to be masticated and which I find it necessary also to discard.    this root when roasted possesses an agreeable flavour not unlike the sweet pittaitoe.    beside the small celindric root mentioned on the 20th inst., they have also another about the same form size and appearance which they use much with the train oil, this root is usually boiled; to me it possesses a disagreeable bitterness.    the top of this plant I have never yet seen. The root of the thistle after undergoing the prossess of sweating or baking in a kiln is sometimes eaten with the train oil also, and at other times pounded find and mixed with could water untill reduced to the consistency of sagamity <a href="#n28012401" id="ln28012401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> or indian mush; in this way I think it very agreeable.    but the most valuable of their roots is foreign to this neighbourhood    I mean the <span class="italic">Wappetoe,</span> or the bulb of the Sagitifolia or common arrow head, which grows in great abundance in the marshey grounds of that beatifull and firtile valley on the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> commencing just above the entrance of <a class="regularization" title="Sandy (Quicksand) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Sandy%20%28Quicksand%29%20River">Quicksand River</a>, and extending downwards for about 70 Miles.    this bulb forms a principal article of traffic between the inhabitants of the valley and those of this neighbourhood or sea coast. The instrument used by the natives in diging their roots is a strong stick of 3½ feet long sharpened at the lower end and it's upper inscerted into a part of an Elks or buck's horn which serves as a handle, standing transversely with the stick or it is in this form <a href="#n28012402" id="ln28012402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    A the lower point, B the upper part or handle.—
