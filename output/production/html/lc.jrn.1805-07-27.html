We set out at an early hour and proceeded on but slowly    the current still so rapid that the men are in a continual state of their utmost exertion to get on, and they begin to weaken fast from this continual state of violent exertion.    at the distance of 1¾ miles the river was again closely hemned in by high Clifts of a solid limestone rock which appear to have tumbled or sunk in the same manner of those discribed yesterday.    the limestone appears to be of an excellent quality of deep blue colour when fractured and of a light led colour where exposed to the weather.    it appears to be of a very fine gr[a]in the fracture like that of marble. <a href="#n17072701" id="ln17072701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    we saw a great number of the bighorn on those Clifts.    at the distance of 3¾ ms. further we arrived at 9 A.
