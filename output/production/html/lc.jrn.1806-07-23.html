                  <em class="hi">Wednesday 23rd.</em>    There was a plesant morning after the rain; and I went with the man who came with me last night, and joined the party at the river. They had repaired the waggons, and put on two more canoes; one of which was very large and gave us a great deal of trouble, as we could not make axletrees out of the willow that would stand more than six or eight miles. At 5 o'clock we got to <a class="regularization" title="Box Elder Creek (Willow Run)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Box%20Elder%20Creek%20%28Willow%20Run%29">Willow creek</a>, and encamped for the night; and made a new axletree.
