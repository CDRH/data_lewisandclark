                  <em class="hi">Sunday 30th.</em> We set out early in a cloudy morning; passed black buffs on the south side, and handsome bottom prairie on the north; saw an Indian on the shore, and the chief we had on board spoke to him. He said he wished to come on board and go with us to the <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Rees</a>; but we did not take him. The wind was fair and we made 9 miles by 10 o'clock. We saw a great number of Indians coming down to the river on the south side. We stopt for breakfast about 200 yards from the shore; then proceeded about a mile; near to the place where the Indians were encamped on the south side; we halted and spoke to them <a href="#n07093004" id="ln07093004" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and then went on under a fine breeze of wind.</p>
               <p>
A short time before night, the waves ran very high and the boat rocked a great deal, which so alarmed our old chief, that he would not go any further. We encamped on the north side.
