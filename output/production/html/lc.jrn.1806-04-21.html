Notwithstanding all the precautions I had taken with rispect to the horses one of them had broken his cord of 5 strands of Elkskin and had gone off spanseled. <a href="#n32042101" id="ln32042101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I sent several men in surch of the horse with orders to return at 10 A. M. with or without the horse being determined to remain no longer with these villains.    they stole another tomahawk from us this morning I surched many of them but could not find it. I ordered all the spare poles, paddles and the ballance of our canoe put on the fire as the morning was cold and also that not a particle should be left for the benefit of the indians. I detected a fellow in stealing an iron socket of a canoe pole and gave him several severe blows and mad the men kick him out of camp. I now informed the indians that I would shoot the first of them that attempted to steal an article from us.    that we were not affraid to fight them, that I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses, but it was not my wish to treat them with severity provided they would let my property alone.    that I would take their horses if I could find out the persons who had stolen the tommahawks, but that I had reather loose the property altogether than take the hose of an inosent person.    the chiefs were present hung their heads and said nothing.    at 9 A. M. <a class="regularization" title="Windsor, Richard" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Windsor%2C%20Richard">Windsor</a> returned with the lost horse, the others who were in surch of the horse soon after returned also.    the Indian who promised to accompany me as far as the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> country produced me two horses one of which he politely gave me the liberty of packing.    we took breakfast and departed a few minutes after 10 OClock. having nine horses loaded and one which <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton</a> rode not being able as yet to march; the two canoes I had dispatched early this morning.    at 1 P.

I had given him a large kettle and a knife in exchange for that horse which I informed him should be taken from him unles he produced me the lost horse or one of equal value in his stead, the latter he prefered and produced me a very good horse which I very cheerfully received.    we soon made the portage with our canoes and baggage and halted about ½ a mile above the Village where we graized our horses and took dinner on some dogs which we purchased of these people.    after dinner we proceeded on about four miles to a village of 9 mat lodges of the <a class="regularization" title="Tenino Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tenino%20Indians">Enesher</a> a little below the entrance of <a class="regularization" title="Deschutes (Clark's, Towanahiook's) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deschutes%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Towanahiook%27s%29%20River">Clark's river [<span class="italic">NB: Towanahiooks</span>

                  <span class="italic">Monday 21st.</span>    This was another pleasant morning with some white frost. We found the horse, which had broke away last night, and made preparations for setting out from this place. While we were making preparations to start, an Indian stole some iron articles from among the men's hands; which so irritated <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a>, that he struck him; which was the first act of the kind, that had happened during the expedition. <a href="#n32042109" id="ln32042109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The Indians however did not resent it, otherwise it is probable we would have had a skirmish with them. This morning we disposed of two canoes and used another for firewood. At 10 o'clock we set out from the first narrows, with nine of our own and one we borrowed, <a href="#n32042110" id="ln32042110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and two canoes all loaded heavy.

Here we got another horse; carried our canoes and baggage round the falls and halted for dinner. We also got some dogs here, and shapaleel, which we subsist on chiefly at present. We halted here two hours and then proceeded on again. The party that went by land had to leave the river, and take out to the hill a part of the way. I crossed with my canoe to the south side, where there is the best water, and passed a large rock island, <a href="#n32042111" id="ln32042111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> opposite to which the <a class="regularization" title="Deschutes (Clark's, Towanahiook's) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deschutes%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Towanahiook%27s%29%20River">Sho-sho-ne river</a>
