            <p>
This volume and the previous two rely largely on the editorial work of previous 
books in this edition. Therefore, the editorial notes and supporting material in 
these three books owe a debt to former consultants and friends of the project. Once 
again we extend our great appreciation to the unselfish work of these generous 
people.</p>
            <p>
Nevertheless, we have several persons to thank specifically for help with this volume. Both the original and fair copy versions of <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Private Joseph Whitehouse's</a> journal 
are at Newberry Library, Chicago, where we were assisted by Robert W. Karrow, Jr., 
Administrative Curator of Special Collections. At our host institution, the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln, help came from John R. Wunder, Linda J. Ratcliffe, and 
Gretchen Walker of the Center for Great Plains Studies, and from Thomas W. Dunlay, Doris VanSchooten, and Mary Higginbotham of the project.</p>
            <p>
The project received financial support from Samuel H. Douglas, III (Whittier, 
California), Nelson S. Weller (Piedmont, California), the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> Trail 
Heritage Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency.</p>
            <p>
We extend our most sincere appreciation to these individuals. Any shortcomings 
in the present work, however, are entirely the fault of the editor.
