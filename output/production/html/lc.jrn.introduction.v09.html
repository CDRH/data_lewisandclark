The essential, definitive record of the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> expedition is contained in
the journals and observations of the two captains, "the writingest explorers of their
time," in the words of Donald Jackson. <a href="#n01" id="ln01" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> If no one else associated with the enterprise had written a word we would still have a marvelous narrative replete with geographic, zoological, botanical, and ethnographic information. In fact, however, at
least four other members of the party did set down their own daily accounts. This
edition brings them together with those of their commanders for the first time.</p>

               <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">President Thomas Jefferson</a> did not order the actual keeping of separate journals by anyone other than the captains. In his final instructions to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, however, he did suggest that "several copies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at leisure times, &amp; put into the care of the most trust-worthy of your attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will
be exposed." <a href="#n02" id="ln02" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> All this would seem to require is that some of the "attendants" copy
the captains' journals verbatim. Apparently <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, at an early stage, decided to do something else. On May 26, 1804, less than two weeks out from <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River
Dubois</a>, the captains noted that "The sergts . . . are directed each to keep a separate
journal from day to day of all passing accurences, and such other observations on
the country &amp;c. as shall appear to them worthy of notice.â€”" <a href="#n03" id="ln03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

In his last communication to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in April 1805, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
wrote: "We have encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of them do so, to
whom in this respect we give every assistance in our power." <a href="#n04" id="ln04" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had a sense of
history; in departing westward from the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages he compared his little fleet
of pirogues and canoes to the vessels of <a class="regularization" title="Cook, James" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cook%2C%20James">Captain Cook</a>. <a href="#n05" id="ln05" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The significance of his enterprise warranted as complete a record as possible. It might be too much to ask any
enlisted men to copy their officers' voluminous journals, but those so inclined could
be encouraged to add their bit to the record.</p>
            <p>
At least some of the men who went with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> seem to have shared that
sense of history. They were volunteers, after all, and although some of them no
doubt simply hoped to escape from irksome military discipline or to find good beaver streams, others evidently knew very well that this was the chance of a lifetime,
that they were involved in something that would survive them, something greater
than their individual contribution. The combination of that sense of history with a
degree of literacy and considerable diligence made a few of them journal keepers.</p>
            <p>
To appreciate the work of these men, let us remember the conditions under
which they wrote. Most days of the voyage involved hard physical labor, working
canoes upstream, loading and unloading bulky equipment, hunting and butchering, tanning leather, making moccasins, cooking, chopping and shaping wood, caring for horses and searching for strays, mounting guard, portaging around falls and rapids, all of it while exposed to every kind of weather and to the attacks of insects
and grizzly bears, with the constant danger of physical injury from accidents. At the
end of such a day, perhaps while others were dancing to <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte's</a> fiddle, a
journal keeper would have to write by the light of a campfire in notebooks somehow
kept safe from the elements. According to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, seven of the thirty-odd men had
the perseverance and the sense of the destiny to try.</p>
            <p>
They wrote under the same conditions as the captains, and like them wrote not
only for themselves. It seems probable that they examined each other's journals,
and perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> read them, too. We know that on July 14, 1804, having
lost his notes for the previous day, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had "to refur to the . . . Journals of Serjeants." The enlisted men's journals were intended as part of the record; they were
public documents and we cannot expect any deep psychological revelations. No one
recorded explicitly, for example, his opinion of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>.</p>
            <p>
Literacy was the first requirement. It is probable that some of the men could not
even write their own names. Historians have expressed considerable humor over
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> awkward grammar and his versatility as a speller, but he was little worse than
many contemporaries who like him were men of affairs, government officials, and
army officers. Comparison of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journal with those of the enlisted men should
keep us from laughing too much at <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. Nor should we be overly amused at the
enlisted men, for none of their journals suggests stupidity or dullness. They tried to
the best of their ability to record an extraordinary experience.</p>
            <p>
Sergeants in the army had to be literate, since they kept records for their companies, and it is not too surprising that three of the four enlisted men's journals that
we now have are those of sergeants. <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">John Ordway</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Charles Floyd</a> held that rank
from the start of the trip, and <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a> was promoted some three months out to
fill the place of the deceased <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</a> is the only private whose
journal we now have. <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> spelling and grammar are, if anything, better than
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>. We cannot judge <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> performance for we do not have his original writing.
<a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a> apparently struggled with writing, but there is rarely doubt
about what they meant.</p>
            <p>
We have four enlisted men's journals, in one form or another. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> indicated
that seven men were keeping journals, and the discrepancy requires some notice,
although few hard conclusions can be made. Since the other sergeants were expected to keep journals, one would assume that <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</a> would
also do so, but no document demonstrating this has come to light. <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> served later
on as an army officer and an Indian agent, but other men filled those posts on the
frontier who could barely sign their names. On August 12, 1806, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> noted that
<a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> had left behind saddlebags containing his "papers," but <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> had just returned from being separated from the main party, and the papers could have consisted only of letters he was supposed to deliver to a Canadian trader, and perhaps
a journal of his separate trip, which began barely three weeks before. In any case,
<a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> went back and recovered the saddlebags, so the papers, whatever they were,
were not then lost. There is simply no clear evidence to show that <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> was one of
the seven journal keepers mentioned by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>.</p>
            <p>
It is fairly certain that one private besides <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a> kept some sort of journal,
because <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Robert Frazer</a> announced his intention to publish by issuing a prospectus
soliciting subscribers barely a month after the party returned to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>, promising
"An accurate description of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and its several branches; of the mountains
separating the Eastern from the Western waters; of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia river</a> and the Bay
it forms on the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>; of the face of the Country in general; of the several
Tribes of Indians on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> rivers . . . ," and with all this "a
variety of Curious and interesting occurrences during a voyage of two years four
months and nine days." The account, <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a> made clear, was "Published by Permission of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captn. Meriwether Lewis</a>." <a href="#n06" id="ln06" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> If the journal was anything like what <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a>
promised, that it was never published is a great pity. Given the importance of the
expedition this is surprising, especially since <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a> was able to secure publication of his work the next year and since there were six further editions of his book
in six years. Clearly it was not lack of public interest in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> discoveries
that held <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer's</a> work back. Whatever the problem was, <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a> passed from view
and so did his journal; we have no clue as to its fate.</p>
            <p>
In April 1805, when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> wrote that seven men were keeping journals, <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> was
already dead. If we accept <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a> as journal keepers, along with <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a>,
<a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a>, we still have two others to account for. It is possible that
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> counted <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a>, whose journal was sent back from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, even though
his record had ceased the previous August. There is a possibility that <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Private Alexander Willard</a> kept a journal, and with <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Willard</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> we would have <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> seven journal keepers. <a href="#n07" id="ln07" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> One way or another a considerable part of the record appears to be lost, perhaps forever.</p>
            <p>
The journals that remain belong with those of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, supporting them
to the best of their ability as they did during the voyage. After the return <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
evaluated his men, each according to his individual merits, and then wrote of them
all: "the Ample support which they gave me under every difficulty; the manly firmness which they evinced on every necessary occasion; and the patience and fortitude
with which they submitted to, and bore, the fatigues and painful sufferings incident to my late tour to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, entitles them to my warmest approbation
and thanks." <a href="#n08" id="ln08" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

               <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Sergeant John Ordway</a> clearly made an important contribution to the success of the
expedition, and he has left us in many ways the fullest of the enlisted men's records.
Yet we know frustratingly little about him. Virtually every mention of him in the
captains' journals refers simply to his performance of some duty, with no other comment. There could be no better evidence that he did his job well. Born in <a class="regularization" title="New Hampshire" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=New%20Hampshire">New
Hampshire</a> in about 1775, apparently he had some of the qualities often attributed
to New Englanders, including steadiness, diligence, and dependability. He was serving in <a class="regularization" title="Bissell, Russell" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bissell%2C%20Russell">Captain Russell Bissell's</a> company of the First Infantry Regiment when he
joined <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, and the captains apparently made him a sergeant before
any of the others who held that rank with the Corps of Discovery. He was left in
charge at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a> on various occasions when the two officers had to be absent. <a href="#n09" id="ln09" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In other words, he was the "top sergeant" of the outfit, expected to preserve
discipline and see that things ran smoothly. He probably had a regular army way of
doing things that pleased <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> but perhaps did not sit too well with some
of the newly enlisted frontiersmen. At any rate, on returning to <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a> on
one occasion, the captains reprimanded <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">Reubin Field</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">John Shields</a> for disobeying <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> who, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> noted, "has during their necessary absence been charged
with the execution of their orders; acting from those orders expressly, and not from
his own capriece, and who, is in all respects accountable to us for the faithfull observance of the same." <a href="#n10" id="ln10" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> That <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> continued as a sergeant indicates that his performance was satisfactory.</p>
            <p>
Since <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a>, like the other members of the Corps, was a volunteer, we might
assume that he had a sense of adventure and wanted to do something more than
serve out his enlistment. More insight into his character can be gained from some
family letters written before he left on the voyage of discovery. In September 1803
he wrote to his brother <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, Stephen" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20Stephen">Stephen</a> of his homesickness, denying a rumor that he had
become engaged, and asking his brother to present his compliments to a young lady
named <a class="regularization" title="Crosby, Betsey" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Crosby%2C%20Betsey">Betsey Crosby</a>, saying, "the probability is, that if She remains in a State of
celibacy till my return I may perhaps join hands with hir yet." <a href="#n11" id="ln11" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Crosby, Betsey" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Crosby%2C%20Betsey">Miss Crosby</a> apparently found <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> promises too indefinite, or the state of celibacy too irksome,

In April 1804 he wrote to his "Honored Parence" telling them of his new enlistment: "I am now on an expidition to the westward, with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt.

and then to go by land, to the western ocean, if nothing prevents, &amp;c." He also told
them that "I am So happy as to be one of them pick'd men from the armey, and I
and all the party are if we live to Return, to Receive our Discharge when ever we
return again toe the united States if we chuse it." He expected to be gone eighteen
months to two years and to receive a "great Reward," of "15 dollars pr. month and
at least 400 ackers of first Rate land, and if we make Great Discoveries as we expect,
the united States, has promised to make us Great Rewards more than we are promised, &amp;c." <a href="#n12" id="ln12" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>

               <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> was the most faithful of all the party's journal keepers; even <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> missed
a few days, but the sergeant has an entry for every day from May 14, 1804, when the
Corps left <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River Dubois</a>, to September 23, 1806, when they returned to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>â€”
863 days in all. He perhaps waited a day or two to fill in entries in especially trying
times, but he cannot have waited long. Even during the most difficult periods, such
as the journey over the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a> in September 1805, his entries are fair-sized paragraphs.

himself with a few lines. His grammar, spelling, and vocabulary are at least as good
as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>.</p>

               <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> did not record the detailed courses and distances of each day's journey,
as the captains did, nor the wealth of scientific data; the events of each day were his
primary concern, yet he shows evidence of curiosity and an interest in the things
and people around him. On May 5, 1805, he noted that the grizzly "bair" killed
that day was one "which the natives and the french tradors call white but all of the
kind that we have seen is of a light brown only owing to the climate as we suppose."
The captains have no such thoughts about the animal's color that day, although they
give a more detailed description. While among the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">Flathead Indians</a> on September 5, 1805, <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> observed, "these natives have the Stranges language of any we

On July 16, 1805, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> both tell us that they sent a man back for an

that we owe the knowledge that he was the culprit. On the return journey, when

The
sergeant was on his own and provides the only record of this part of the expedition
from July 13 to July 19, 1806, when he joined the party under <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Sergeant Gass</a> that

he described the tragic events of the captain's party.

               <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> did not choose any more than did the other journal keepers to provide
much information about the day-to-day personal relationships within the party. 
The nature of his office surely caused special strains and frustrations, but he said
nothing of this; there is no hint of the incidents of disobedience at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Dubois%20%28Camp%20Wood%2C%20River%20Dubois%29%20%28Ill.%29">Camp Dubois</a>,
which occurred before he began his journal. We would like to know how the top
sergeant of the Corps of Discovery evaluated the men who served with him, and the
two men who commanded him, but the New Hampshireman maintained his discretion. Like the captains he was writing a public document, not a private record of
emotions. Even the desertion of <a class="regularization" title="Reed, Moses B." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Reed%2C%20Moses%20B.">Moses Reed</a>, which aroused <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd's</a> indignation, is
reported by <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> in the most matter-of-fact way, on August 6, 1804.</p>

He accompanied <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and a party of Indians to <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in late 1806,
took his discharge from the army, and returned to <a class="regularization" title="New Hampshire" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>. In 1809 he
settled in <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, where he married and became prosperous, acquiring "two plantations under good cultivation peach and apple orchards, good buildings &amp;c &amp;c."
He did not enjoy them for long, however, for both he and his wife were dead by
1817. <a href="#n13" id="ln13" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>

               <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> journal is in three notebooks. The first, handstitched sheets covered by
loose boards, apparently started out as the Orderly Book of the Corps, which the
sergeant would have kept as part of his duties, and became his journal on May 14,
1804, when the expedition set out. This book lasted him until the end of September 1805. The next day, October 1, at the <a class="regularization" title="Canoe Camp (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Canoe%20Camp%20%28Idaho%29">Canoe Camp</a> on the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater River</a> in
<a class="regularization" title="Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Idaho">Idaho</a>, he commenced writing in a notebook bound in stiff boards and covered with

served him until September 23, 1806, when he closed: "the party all considerable

               <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> turned his journal over to the captains in return for $300. It was among
the papers that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> provided <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</a> for use in preparing his history of

journal, which he also examined, probably in its printed form. Indeed he was so
fond of it that he never returned it to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, as he was supposed to, nor did he turn

We do not know a great deal more about him. He has the tragic fame of being the
only man of the party to die on the expedition, and an impressive monument rises

his brother <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Nathaniel" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Nathaniel">Nathaniel</a> wrote to their sister <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Nancy" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Nancy">Nancy</a> that "he was well cared for as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>

from civilian life, the captains made him a sergeant over men who were older, had
much more frontier experience, and had served in the regular army. This elevation
must have reflected his education, his character, and perhaps his family connections. Writing shortly after the sergeant's death, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> said that <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> "had at All

probably an indication that he did his duty efficiently and caused no trouble. Starting with the official beginning of the expedition on May 14, 1804, he kept his journal faithfully until two days before his death on August 20, 1804, although he must
have been feeling the effects of his illness well before then. <a href="#n17" id="ln17" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>

               <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> kept his journal in a small notebook with marbled paper over the covers,

spring of 1805. In 1893 Reuben Gold Thwaites discovered it among the papers of
Lyman Draper, former head of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. Draper, an
assiduous collector of historical documents, had acquired a large number of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>
papers from the captain's nephew, <a class="regularization" title="Croghan, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Croghan%2C%20John">John Croghan</a>, and had also corresponded with

laconic. His spelling and grammar are also reminiscent of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, and like the captain his vocabulary and phrasing suggest a man who had done some reading. In
some cases it is clear that he had copied passages verbatim from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, in the spirit
of <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson's</a> instructions.
