The following items represent another collection of miscellaneous documents comparable to the miscellany gathered at <a href="lc.jrn.1804-1805.winter.introduction">
                  Fort Mandan
               </a> and at <a href="lc.jrn.1805-1806.winter.introduction">
                  Fort Clatsop
               </a>. Many of the items may have been started at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a> or at <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a>, but there is no way to positively date them. Certainly, some of them were completed near the end of or at the close of the expedition after reaching <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>. The fact that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> Estimated Distances include his trip on the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a> testifies to the late completion of that document. The documents in Part 2 particularly show the haste to finish up some summary-type lists and broad overviews of the new lands through which the party had passed. After reaching <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> in September 1806 the time for developing such tables, lists, and compilations would be scarce.
