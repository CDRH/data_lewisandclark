The morning was fair, we arrose early and dispatched a few of our hunters to the opposite side of the river, and employed a part of the men in transporting our baggage to the opposite shore wile others were directed to collect the horses; at 10 A. M. we had taken our baggage over and collected our horses, we then took breakfast, after which we drove our horses into the river which they swam without accedent and all arrived safe on the opposite shore.    the river is 150 yds. wide at this place and extreemly rapid.    tho' it may be safely navigated at this season, as the water covers all the rocks which lie in it's bed to a considerable debth.    we followed our horses and again collected them, after which we removed our baggage to a position which we had previously selected for our permanent camp about half a mile below. <a href="#n35051401" id="ln35051401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    this was a very eligible spot for defence it had been an ancient habitation of the indians; was sunk about 4 feet in the ground and raised arround it's outer edge about three ½ feet with a good wall of eath.    the whole was a circle of about 30 feet in diameter.    arround this we formed our tents of sticks and grass facing outwards and deposited our baggage within the sunken space under a shelter which we constructed for the purpose.    our situation was within 40 paces of the river in an extentsive level bottom thinly timbered with the longleafed pine.    here we are in the vicinity of the best hunting grounds from indian information, are convenient to the salmon which we expect daily and have an excellent pasture for our horses.    the hills to the E and North of us are high broken and but partially timbered; the soil is rich and affords fine grass.    in short as we are compelled to reside a while in this neighbourhood I feel perfectly satisfyed with our position.— immediately after we had passed the river <a class="regularization" title="Broken Arm" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Broken%20Arm">Tunnachemootoolt</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Hohots Ilppilp" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp">Hosâstillpilp</a> arrived on the south side with a party of a douzen of their young men; they began to sing in token of friendship as is their custom, and we sent the canoe over for them.    they left their horses and came over accompanyed by several of their party among whom were the 2 young men who had presented us with two horses in behalf of the nation; one of these was the son of <a class="regularization" title="Broken Arm" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Broken%20Arm">Tunnachemootoolt</a> and the other the son of the Cheif who was killed by the <a class="regularization" title="Atsina Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Atsina%20Indians">Minnetares</a> of <a class="regularization" title="Fort des Prairies (Canada)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20des%20Prairies%20%28Canada%29">Fort de Prarie</a> last year and the same who had given us the mare and Colt.    we received them at our camp and smoked with them; after some hours <a class="regularization" title="Hohots Ilppilp" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp">Hohâstillpilp</a> with much cerimony presented me with a very eligant grey gelding which he had brought for that purpose. I gave him in return a handkercheif 200 balls and 4 lbs. of powder.    with which he appeared perfectly satisfyed. <a class="regularization" title="Collins, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Collins%2C%20John">Collins</a> killed two bear this morning and was sent with two others in quest of the meat; with which they returned in the evening; the mail bear was large and fat the female was of moderate size and reather meagre.    we had the fat bear fleaced in order to reserve the oil for the mountains. both these bear were of the speceis common to the upper part of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">missouri</a>.    they may be called white black grzly brown or red bear for they are found of all those colours.    perhaps it would not be [<em class="hi">erased word; illegible</em>] unappropriate to designate them the variagated bear. <a href="#n35051402" id="ln35051402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    we gave the indians who were about 15 in number half the female bear, with the sholder head and neck of the other.    this was a great treat to those poor wretches who scarcely taist meat once a month.    they immediately prepared a brisk fire of dry wood on which they threw a parsel of smooth stones from the river, when the fire had birnt down and heated the stones they placed them level and laid on a parsel of pine boughs, on these they laid the flesh of the bear in flitches, placing boughs between each course of meat and then covering it thickly with pine boughs; after this they poared on a small quantity of water and covered the whoe over with 〈about〉 earth to the debth of four inches.    in this situation they suffered it to remain about 3 hours when they took it out. I taisted of this meat and found it much more tender than that which we had roasted or boiled, but the strong flavor of the pine distroyed it for my pallate. <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Labuish</a> returned late in the evening and informed us that he had killed a female bear and two large cubbs, he brought with him several large dark brown pheasants which he had also killed. <a class="regularization" title="Shannon, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shannon%2C%20George">Shannon</a> also returned with a few pheasants and two squirrells.    we have found our stone horses so troublesome that we indeavoured to exchange them with the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> for mears or gelings but they will not exchange altho' we offer 2 for one; we came to a resolution to castrate them and began the operation this evening    one of the indians present offered his services on this occasion.    he cut them without tying the string of the stone as is usual, and assures us that they will do much better in that way; <a href="#n35051403" id="ln35051403" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> he takes care to scrape the string very clean and to seperate it from all the adhereing veigns before he cuts it.    we shall have an opportunity of judging whether this is a method preferable to that commonly practiced as <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> had gelded two in the usual way.

                  <em class="hi">Wednesday 14th.</em>    The morning was pleasant with some white frost. Three hunters went over very early to the north side of the river. All the rest of the men were employed in collecting our horses and taking over the baggage. About noon we got all the horses and baggage over safe; and met with one of our hunters, <a href="#n35051407" id="ln35051407" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> who had killed two bears, some distance off. So two men <a href="#n35051408" id="ln35051408" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> were dispatched with him to bring in the meat; and we set about forming a camp at the remains of an ancient village on the north side of the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Koos-
koos-ke river</a>. We were accompanied by a number of the natives, one of whom gave us a horse; and three more of our old stock were brought in by them. In the afternoon we had an operation performed on seven of our horses, to render them more peaceable; which was done by one of the natives upon all but one. <a href="#n35051409" id="ln35051409" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In the evening the men came in with the meat of the two bears; and also our other hunters who had killed three more, all of the grizly kind. We gave some of the meat to the natives at our camp, who 
cooked it in their own way; which was done in the following manner. They first collected some stones and heated them, upon which they placed a part of the meat, and upon the meat some small brush, and so alternately meat 
and brush, until all the meat was on; when the whole was covered with brush and lastly with earth; so that the heap or mass had something of the appearance of a small coalpit on fire. An hour and an half was necessary to cook it 
in this way. The natives remained at our camp all night.
