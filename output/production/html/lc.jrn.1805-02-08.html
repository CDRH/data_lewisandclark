The <a class="regularization" title="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Black%20Cat%20%28Posecopsahe%29">black Cat</a> presented me with a bow and apologized for not having completed the shield he had promised alledging that the weather had been too could to permit his making it, I gave him som small shot 6 fishing-hooks and 2 yards of ribbon    his squaw also presented me with 2 pair of mockersons for which in return I gave a small lookingglass and a couples of nedles.    the chief dined with me and left me in the evening.    he informed me that his people suffered very much for the article of meat, and that he had not himself tasted any for several days.—
