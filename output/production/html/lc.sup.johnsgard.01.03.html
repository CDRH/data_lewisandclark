               <h4>Summary of Route and Major Biological Discoveries</h4>
               <p>Although the extreme southeastern boundary of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> was
reached on August 21, 1804, the first actual <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> campsite
was made on August 23, when the group camped near the present site
of <span class="tei_name">Vermillion</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. On that same day they killed their first bison,
near the present site of <span class="tei_name">Ionia</span>, <span class="tei_name">Dixon County</span>. On the 24th they passed a "bluff
of blue clay," the so-called <span class="tei_name">Burning Bluffs</span>. The surface of this rocky outcrop
was unaccountably warm to the touch, as if it had been burning from within,
a phenomenon now believed to have been caused by chemical oxidation. By
August 28 the group had reached the present site of <span class="tei_name">Yankton</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>,
where they remained until August 31, holding a council with the local <span class="tei_name">Yankton
Sioux</span> natives. On September 7 they observed a treeless dome on the south
side of the river that they named <span class="tei_name">"The Cupola" (now known as Old Baldy)</span>. At
the base of this conical dome they discovered a colony of black-tailed prairie
dogs, a species then new to science. After the entire group spent most of a day
fetching and pouring about five barrels of water down one hole, the resident
rodent was finally evicted and caught. Several others were shot and their skins
preserved. Some prairie dogs were also eaten during the expedition and were
considered fine table fare. Two other members of the prairie-dog community
that directly depend on prairie dogs for their own survival, the burrowing owl
(<span class="italic">Athene cunicularia</span>) and the black-footed ferret (<span class="italic">Mustela nigripes</span>), were not
encountered. The ferret was not discovered and described scientifically for another
half-century, but by 1900 it had already been virtually eliminated from
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> as well as from most of the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>. It was one of the first
<span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> endemic species to be listed under the Endangered Species Act.
The <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> race of the burrowing owl was discovered on the plains of
western <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> in 1820. The rapidly declining burrowing owl may also soon
be a candidate for similar nationally threatened or endangered listing.</p>

               <p>The expedition left the common boundary of <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> and <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>
on September 8, 1804. Moving north in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, large herds of bison were
seen, as well as elk and deer. They passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">White River</span> on
September 15, soon encountering "multitudes" of prairie dogs and vast herds
of bison and antelope. By September 20 they had reached the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend of the
Missouri River</span>, sending two men by horseback across the narrow peninsula to
hunt and await their arrival around the enormous bend. Here the first female
pronghorn was killed, as well as several mule deer. A coyote was also killed, and
was identified as a small species of prairie wolf. On September 24 they reached
what they called the <span class="tei_name">"Teton" River (now known as the Bad River</span>, its original
English name), so named by the group because of the <span class="tei_name">Teton (Brule) Lakotas</span>
who lived along it. Several days were spent interacting with this tribe, including
some distinctly unfriendly encounters, and it was not until September 28 that
they again departed upstream. They soon passed several abandoned villages of
the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> ("<span class="tei_name">Rickaras</span>"), and by October 8 met the first band of that group near
the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>. By the 13th they were on their way again, passing
the mouth of <span class="tei_name">Spring Creek</span> (now <span class="tei_name">Campbell County</span>), a short distance below
the present <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> boundary. That night was their last <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>
campground, and on October 14 they camped near <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot Creek</span>, virtually
on the present <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>-<span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> boundary.</p>
               <p>They passed the mouth of <span class="tei_name">North Dakota's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Cannonball River</span> on October 18,
in what is the present-day <span class="tei_name">Standing Rock Reservation</span>, and on the 19th counted
53 herds of bison and 3 elk herds, all in view at a single time. They soon began
to encounter abandoned <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages as well as old <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages. There
were also active <span class="tei_name">Awatixa Hidatsa ("Minnetaree")</span> villages in the area, along the
<span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>. It was at one of these <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages that the teenaged <span class="tei_name">Shoshone</span>
woman <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> was living with a French fur trader, <span class="tei_name">Touissant Charbonneau</span>.
She had been captured and abducted near <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> about five years earlier
by the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>, and had been won by <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> on a wager. On October 26
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived at an active <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village site, a location they selected
for their winter quarters and named <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Later known as <span class="tei_name">Fort Clark</span>,
it was located in what is now the southeastern corner of <span class="tei_name">Mercer County</span>. They
were approximately 1,600 river miles up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> from their starting point
and roughly halfway across their transcontinental route.</p>
               <p>The expedition spent the winter of 1804-5 at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, not departing
again until April 7, 1805. At that point the Corps of Discovery consisted of 32
persons. Besides their basic exploratory party of 28 men, they had added 2 interpreters,
including <span class="tei_name">Touissant Charbonneau</span> as well as <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and her infant
son, <span class="tei_name">Baptiste</span>, born only about two months previously. The keelboat and its
crew of eleven men were sent back to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, along with many specimens and artifacts that were destined for <span class="tei_name">Washington DC</span>. Among them were live prairie
dogs and magpies, 60 preserved plant specimens, a variety of Native American
materials, and various skins and skeletons.</p>
               <p>The Corps then headed upstream, passing the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri
River</span> on April 12 and reaching the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> on April 26,
where they were only a few miles from the present-day boundary of <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.
Between this point and the present boundary, <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span> was built in 1830 and
operated as a frontier trading post for some time before being abandoned. They
entered what is now eastern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> on April 27, 1805, camping just a few miles
upstream.</p>
               <p>The return trip was much more rapid and far less rewarding in terms of
biological discovery. Little time was wasted during this phase, especially after
<span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis's</span> narrow escape from eight <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> men during his independent
exploration of the upper <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> of western <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, together with
three of his men. After that hazardous encounter the four men quickly returned
to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>. There they rejoined the rest of their party and continued
downstream, reaching the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> and the approximate
boundary of present-day <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> on August 7.</p>
               <p>This confluence of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Rivers (approximately at
the current <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>-<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> border) was the agreed-upon rendezvous
point for rejoining <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> and his men after their separate route down
the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>. However, by the time Lewis and his party finally arrived
at the planned meeting point, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> group had already departed downstream
and had left an explanatory note. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men thus moved quickly downstream
to catch up. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party finally caught up with that of <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>
about 150 miles below the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> on August 12, 1806,
at a location now flooded by <span class="tei_name">Lake Sakakawea</span> but that was probably near <span class="tei_name">Crow
Flies High Butte</span>.</p>
               <p>The combined Corps then descended the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> in what is now
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. They passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri River</span> on August 13,
and reached <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> by the 17th. On August 22 they passed the mouth of
the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>, and thus were about 25 miles into present-day <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>,
and on August 25th they passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span>. By September
1 they had passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara River</span>, and had the present-day <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>
shoreline on their south side. On September 4th they passed the mouth
of the <span class="tei_name">Big Sioux River</span>, and were then entirely out of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> and had
entered what would eventually become <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span> and <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>.</p>

                     </strong>
                     <p>As noted earlier, the first large herd of bison was noted on September 9,
1804, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara River</span> along the <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>-<span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>
boundary. Thereafter, bison were present in uncountable numbers on the <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span>
plains. On September 17, 1804, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">White River</span>, a group
of about 3,000 were in view at a single time. Between the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Bon Homme
Island</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, and the expedition's arrival at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, 35 bison were
killed. One more was killed at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> in November, and at least 42 more
by the middle of December. Only three were killed during the rest of winter at
<span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, and the animals were not mentioned again until the group began
their spring ascent up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Then, from about 50 miles north of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri
River</span>, increasing numbers of bison were seen, including "immence
herds" of bison, deer, and pronghorns in the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">White Earth River</span> on
April 22, 1805.</p>

                     <strong>Black-tailed Prairie Dog <span class="italic">Cynomys ludovicianus</span> FIG. 10</strong>
                     <p>The black-tailed prairie dog was first described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> but not
formally named as a new species until 1815. As noted earlier, it was discovered
somewhat upstream of the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara River</span> on September 7, 1804,
at a clay promontory the explorers described as "The Tower," located in what
is now northern <span class="tei_name">Boyd County</span>. The animals were called "barking squirrels" by
<span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>, and prairie dogs (a rough translation of the French <span class="italic">petite chien</span>)
by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>. The description by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> is highly detailed and accurate;
that of <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> is shorter but very interesting. The explorers also
saw prairie-dog towns in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> near the <span class="tei_name">White River</span>. These rodents
were not specifically mentioned while the expedition was in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, although
the animals are known from later records to have been abundant along
the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, and the four prairie dogs sent back to <span class="tei_name">Washington DC</span> in the
spring of l805 from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> probably had been captured locally. One of
them survived the 4,000-mile journey and was exhibited for a time at <span class="tei_name">Charles
W. Peale's</span>
                        <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> Museum, then located in <span class="tei_name">Independence Hall</span>. Prairie
dogs were again observed in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, including a colony about seven miles in
length that was seen in the vicinity of the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>. At that
location a few were killed and eaten, and were found to be "well flavoured and
tender." They were also seen near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Musselshell River</span>. On the
return trip prairie dogs were seen as far south as the vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara
River</span>, along the <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>-<span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> border, and apparently close to where
they had first been discovered.</p>

                     <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> deserve credit for discovering that this species is distinct
from the larger gray wolf. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> first mentioned it on September 18,
1804, when a "prairie wolf" said to be the size of a gray fox was shot near the
<span class="tei_name">White River</span> of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had earlier (August 12, 1804) observed a
kind of smaller wolf that "barks like a large ferce dog." It wasn't until the expedition
was on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> the next spring (May 5, 1805) that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found
a den of young "wolves," and <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> referred to them as being a "small
wolf or burrowing dog of the prairies." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> noted their doglike vocalizations,
their relatively long and pointed ears, and their unusually long claws. Although the coyote was thus first well described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, it was not formally named as a distinct species until 1828.

<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, but it was not formally named until 1823. The gray wolf was
apparently first encountered on July 20, 1804, near the mouth of <span class="tei_name">Weeping Water
Creek</span> in southeastern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, when a "large yellow wolf" was killed. On
September 21, near the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend of the Missouri</span> in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, a "white"
wolf was shot and skinned. Both wolves and coyotes were seen during the expedition
between southeastern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Coast</span>; both were called
"wolves" and often were not distinguished. However, the larger form was sometimes
called the "white wolf" and at other times the "large brown wolf." Near
<span class="tei_name">Wolf Point</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, on May 5, 1805, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> described the wolf well,
pointing out that it differed from the smaller coyote in not taking refuge in the
ground or in a burrow. He also noted that the colors of true wolves varied from
blackish brown or gray to creamy white. Wolves were eliminated from <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>
by 1920, from <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> probably during the 1920s, and from <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>
by 1934, when the last one was killed in the <span class="tei_name">Black Hills</span>. Vagrants have been reported
at least three times in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> since 1980.</p>

                     <p>The grizzly bear was first mentioned by the expedition about 25 miles below
the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara River</span>, along the <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>-<span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> boundary,
where a "<span class="tei_name">White Bear Clift</span>" was named as the site where a grizzly bear had
once been killed. Bear tracks were seen on October 7, 1804, on <span class="tei_name">Fox Island</span>, near
the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Moreau River</span> in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. However, the first actual encounter with
a grizzly was on October 20, 1804,when one was wounded near the
mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Heart River</span>, just south of present-day <span class="tei_name">Bismarck</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>.
Bear tracks of great size were also encountered at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri
River</span> on April 13, 1805. Finally, a grizzly bear was killed by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>
on April 29 at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>, near the <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> border.
An even larger male was killed by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> on May 5; this preserved specimen
was the basis for a later formal description and naming (<span class="italic">Ursus ferox</span>) of
the species. When Prince Maximilian and Audubon visited the <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span> area
30 and 39 years later, respectively, grizzly bears were still common there. However,
grizzly bears were extirpated from <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> by about 1890 and from
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> by about the end of the nineteenth century. Two were killed near
<span class="tei_name">Oakdale</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, in the autumn of 1897, perhaps representing the last
known from that state, or indeed from anywhere within the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> east of
<span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.</p>

                        <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not mention seeing live weasels in the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>, but
<span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> purchased a weasel skin at a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village in November 1804.
Although weasel skins, especially the white winter-pelage type (ermine), were
much prized by Native Americans for their decorative value, they had no real
market value for white trappers, and thus no numerical records of early weasel
skin harvests are available.</p>

                     <p>Although bobcats are still common in western <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, there is no
record of live bobcats having been encountered by the expedition. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>
mentioned having acquired gloves and a cap made of the skin of a "louservia."
Such skins were obtained from the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>. Lynxes were also moderately
regular in northeastern <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> during the early 1800s, but they were
often confused with bobcats. Maximilian reported in 1833 that 1,000 to 2,000
lynx skins were brought into <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span> annually, as well as a similar number
of bobcat skins. Vagrant lynx still occasionally wander into northern <span class="tei_name">North

seed hordes of "artichokes" (probably <span class="italic">Helianthus tuberosus</span>). However,
Rueben Thwaites has suggested that these rodents might instead have been
"gophers" (his usage presumably referring to ground squirrels rather than true
gophers).</p>

                     <p>The mule deer was first recognized and accurately described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> but not formally described until 1817. It was first mentioned on September
5, in the vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara River</span>, when the descriptive term "black-tailed
deer" was applied to several deer seen by one of the crew members. The first
specimen of this species was shot near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">White River</span>, <span class="tei_name">South
Dakota</span>, on September 17, 1804. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> immediately recognized it to
be different from the white-tailed deer, especially in its large and long ears, its
more rounded and black-tipped tail, and in its distinctive bounding behavior
when frightened. Four more were shot near the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend of the Missouri</span> on
September 19, when the equally characteristic symmetrical forking pattern of
the species' antlers was also noted by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>. A much more detailed
anatomical description was provided by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> on May 10, 1805, when
he initially referred to it as a "mule deer," as distinct from the white-tailed or
"common deer." Relatively few mule deer were mentioned during the <span class="tei_name">North
Dakota</span> phase of the trip. During the return trip mule deer were last noted in
the vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">White River</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>.</p>

                     <p>Muskrats were mentioned only briefly in the expedition journals (e.g., August
7, 1805), but in contrast to beaver no special note was made of these familiar

                     <p>River otters were first reported by the expedition in the vicinity of present-day
<span class="tei_name">Bismarck</span> on October 22, 1804, when one was killed. It was next noted on
April 14, 1805, when one was seen near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri River</span>
in northwestern <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. In 1833 Maximilian reported that 200 to 300
otter skins were brought in annually to <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span>, and the skins were often
used by Native Americans as decorations. By the early 1900s otters had been
eliminated from all <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> rivers and were very rare in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> and
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>. Transplant and release efforts in <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> have helped restore
that state's population, which is still very small. There have been recent records

                     <p>A few mentions of the porcupine appear in the journals. Like the muskrat,
it was evidently not considered to be of special economic or biological interest.
One was killed near present-day <span class="tei_name">Brule City</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, on September 13,
1804, and others were seen near present-day <span class="tei_name">Poplar</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, on May 5, 1805,
where a small river was named <span class="tei_name">Porcupine River</span> (now the <span class="tei_name">Poplar River</span>) because
of the abundance of porcupines there.</p>

                     <p>The first pronghorn killed during the expedition was obtained near the
mouth of the <span class="tei_name">White River</span> in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> on September 14, 1804. This was
a male, or "Buck Goat," in <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark's</span> words. He described it fairly well,
concluding it to be "more like the Antilope or Gazella of Africa" than like any
species of goat. The first female was killed six days later in the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend</span> region
of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted the female's smaller size and smaller horns, and
that neither sex has a beard. He thought the animals to be "keenly made" and
"butifull." Pronghorns were eventually almost extirpated from <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> by the
early 1900s but have recently become locally reestablished as a result of release
programs. They were also barely surviving in the <span class="tei_name">Dakotas</span> by the turn of the

<span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> species, but it is likely that the ground squirrel they observed
near the vicinity of present-day <span class="tei_name">Garrison Dam</span> on April 9, 1805, was of this
species. The species is still so common in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> that that state has at
times been called the "Flickertail State." However, no clear and convincing description
of the animal was provided by either <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> or <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. The Richardson's
ground squirrel was not formally described until 1811.</p>

on May 25, 1805. The <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span> honored the skunk for its refusal to retreat in the
face of danger, and sometimes their chiefs tied the skins of skunks to their heels
to symbolize the fact that they never ran from a battle. Like the badger, wolf,
and fox, the skunk possessed special symbolic powers to the tribes of the high

were in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, but only a few decades later Maximilian reported this
species ("prairie foxes") to be common around <span class="tei_name">Fort Clark</span>, and kept one as a
pet. Still later, Audubon also found them to be common at both <span class="tei_name">Fort Clark</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span>. One that had been captured alive at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clark</span> was presented to
Audubon, and he also kept it as a pet, eventually taking it back to his home in
<span class="tei_name">New York</span> State. Swift fox skins were worn by men of the Kit Fox Society of the
<span class="tei_name">Oglala Sioux</span>, and their fur was additionally used to wrap war lances. Similarly,
wolf skins were worn ceremonially by men of the Wolf Society and were also
used as camouflage when stalking bison. The Kit Fox Society of the <span class="tei_name">Oglalas</span> was
one of the "policing" societies largely concerned with camp life and hunting,
whereas the Wolf Society was a war society. However, inherent courage was also
a part of the Kit Fox Society, and according to Joseph Brown one of their songs
was as follows: "I am a Fox. I am supposed to die. If there is anything difficult,
if there is anything dangerous, that is mine to do."</p>

                     <p>The white-tailed jackrabbit was first described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> but was
not formally described and scientifically named until 1839. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
properly referred to jackrabbits as "hares" rather than rabbits. After collecting
the first specimen near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">White River</span> on September 14, 1804,
<span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> provided measurements and commented on its white tail. His
description thus clearly separates it from the black-tailed jackrabbit (<span class="italic">L. californicus</span>)
of the same general region, although it now generally occurs farther
south. Other sightings of jackrabbits in <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> occurred on September
17, 20, and 24, 1804. One was killed at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> in January of 1805, and another
was obtained in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> the following spring, not far north of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Jackrabbits were also seen at several <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> sites. One that was shot
on May 26, 1805, weighed 8.5 pounds, which is fairly large even for a white-tailed
jackrabbit, and is substantially larger than the black-tailed jackrabbit. White-tailed
jackrabbits remained common in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> well into the 1900s; during
one organized hunt near the town of <span class="tei_name">New England</span> in December of 1924,
7,550 of the animals were killed. This writer remembers community hunts being
organized in the <span class="tei_name">Red River</span> Valley of <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> into the mid-1930s, during
the depression and drought years. White-tailed jackrabbits are now quite rare

serripennis</span>), which also nest along the steep bluffs of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri
River</span>. Both species would have been gathering for fall migration during late
August. Bank swallows historically nested in vast numbers on the nearly vertical
loess bluffs along the middle <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, from the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Platte</span>
into <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, according to James Ducey. Recent population trends of these

                     <p>Magpies were apparently first seen near the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend of the Missouri</span> and
were later found to be winter residents of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Four living specimens
were sent from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> to <span class="tei_name">President Jefferson</span>, who in turn passed at least
one surviving individual on to <span class="tei_name">Charles W. Peale</span> for exhibit in the <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span>
Museum. This specimen was later used by Alexander Wilson as the basis for an
illustration in his American Ornithology. The species was already well known
from Europe, but the American magpie represented a new subspecies. Magpies
were also reported in eastern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> near <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span> (April 27, 1805) and near
<span class="tei_name">Fort Peck</span> (August 3, 1806). Black-billed magpie populations have decreased significantly
in North America during the last four decades.</p>

                     <p>Although the blue jay is not mentioned in the journals, one of the expedition
members informed Wilson (American Ornithology) that the generally ubiquitous
blue jay was progressively replaced by the magpie to the north and west
of the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend of the Missouri River</span>, where the magpie was first encountered
(Reid and Gannon 1999). This same sort of ecological and geographic replacement
of the blue jay by the magpie is evident today on the western high plains.
Like magpies, blue jay populations have declined significantly in North America
during the last four decades, perhaps in part because of competition with the
larger American crows.</p>

captured a small bird that he recognized as belonging to the "order of the [blank
space; he probably intended "Caprimulgiformes"] or goat sucker." He noted
that the bird appeared to be becoming dormant a fact that was not fully established
for this or any other North American bird species by ornithologists
for another 145 years. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also astutely observed that under the freezing conditions
(30 degrees F) the bird could scarcely move, and that even after its heart
and lungs were pierced with a knife it remained alive for nearly two hours! Like
his later substantiated report of finding Canada geese nesting in trees (probably
using old nests of osprey or eagle), this observation was probably not believed
by scientists of the time.</p>

on the upper <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> (July 19, 1806). Just as magpies tend to replace blue
jays as one proceeds westward in the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>, ravens also tend to replace

white gulls were mentioned at various times. On August 7, 1806, near
the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> reported flocks of "white gulls about
the size of a pigeon, with the top of their heads black." This description might
fit the Franklin's gull better than the Forster's tern, since the gull is more likely
to migrate in large flocks, and in the summer plumage of the Franklin's gull the
entire upper and rear parts of the head are black or dark gray.</p>

wintering in the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, according to <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> notes of April

than the eastern form of this species. This is an interesting (albeit incorrect)

Meteorological Register of February 8, 1805, it was noted that the
"black-and-white speckled woodpecker" had returned to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. The
larger hairy woodpecker is more likely to be found in <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> during
February than is the downy, although the downy is perhaps generally somewhat
more common than the hairy as a breeding species along the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>

on August 25, 1804. This species was also noted to have returned seasonally to
western <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> by April 10, 1805. Horned larks were again seen near
<span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> (June 19-25, 1805). They are still among the most common
breeding birds of the shortgrass plains and are one of the few likely to
overwinter as far north as <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> and <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. Although called a "ren,"
the bird's seasonal timing and habitats as described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> do not
fit the house wren (<span class="italic">Troglodytes aedon</span>). Horned lark populations have decreased

                     <p>On April 17, 1805, in northwestern <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, the group saw a "curlue."
A "brown curlue" was also noted on April 22, 1805, near the present <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>
border. These most probably were long-billed curlews, as the smaller and
arctic-nesting whimbrel (<span class="italic">Numenius phaeopus</span>) is very rare in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. Birds
described as curlews were also later seen in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> during the nesting season,
near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> (July 11-13, 1805) and near the present locations of <span class="tei_name">Townsend</span>
(July 24, 1805) and <span class="tei_name">Whitehall</span> (August 3, 1805), all within the historic breeding
range of long-billed curlews. Long-billed curlew populations have declined significantly

of the well-known "lark-woodpecker." His description perfectly fits the
yellow-shafted form of the northern flicker. About four decades later, Audubon
encountered flickers that were intermediate in plumage between the eastern
yellow-shafted and western red-shafted types, along this same part of the upper
<span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley. At the time, the red-shafted was considered a separate species
from the yellow-shafted, but they are now regarded as only racially distinct, as
a broad zone of intermingled genetic types occurs in this general plains region.
Northern flicker populations have declined significantly in North America during

                     <p>This now-extinct but once extremely common pigeon was first mentioned
on February 12, 1804, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> at the start of their
trip. <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> mentioned the birds again near the <span class="tei_name">White River</span> in southern
<span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> on September 16, 1804. They were also seen in west-central
<span class="tei_name">Montana</span> on July 12 and 13, 1805, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Sun River</span>, and one was
shot by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> on the 13th. On the return trip <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> noted them near
<span class="tei_name">Missoula</span> on July 5, 1806, and also along <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank River</span> in northwestern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>
on July 25, 1806. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> likewise mentioned seeing pigeons along
the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> on July 25, 1806. These latter sightings may well have involved
the band-tailed pigeon (<span class="italic">Columba fasciata</span>), as the passenger pigeon is
only known with certainty to have occurred in northern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. The passenger
pigeon was last reported from the <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> region in 1875, from what is

were observed to "commence" at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">James River</span>, and they were

<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> (February 13, 1805), and again near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri
River</span> in extreme western <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> (April 12, 1805). On April 15, 1805,
about 50 miles above the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri River</span> and close to the
present-day <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> border, a group of displaying males was seen by <span class="tei_name">Captain

on April 9 and 13, 1805, between <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri River</span>,
and again on May 5, near <span class="tei_name">Prairie Elk Creek</span>. The ones he described were of
the usual white-plumaged morph type; the "gray brant" he described as also
present in the flocks might have been young of the previous year or perhaps
adults or young of the so-called "blue goose" genetic variant, which are mostly
dark grayish brown. He also described a "common brown brant" two-thirds
the size of the "common goose" (Canada goose), which might have been one
of the smaller races of the Canada goose. The "pided" (pied) brant seen and
carefully described later in Oregon was the greater white-fronted goose (<span class="italic">Anser albifrons</span>), which also migrates through the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> in large numbers. In
<span class="tei_name">Montana</span> snow geese were reportedly seen as far west as the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Wolf
Point</span> (May 5, 1805). Snow goose populations have increased very significantly
in North America during the last four decades, largely because they have adjusted
their migrations to exploit the protection afforded by wildlife refuges,
and are now perhaps more abundant than at any time in American history.</p>

tundra (previously whistling) swans, but perhaps more likely were trumpeter
swans, quasi-permanent residents of the northern plains. Later, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>
described the whistling swan in some detail, based on his observations in <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>,
and was the first person to call it a "whistleing swan," thus distinguishing
it from the "large swan" (trumpeter swan) they had seen earlier on the <span class="tei_name">Great

trumpeter swan. Trumpeter swan populations have been recovering in North

near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, on June 22, 1805. He contrasted it with the "old field
lark" (eastern meadowlark, <span class="italic">Sturnella magna</span>) of the Atlantic states, noting the
two species' considerable differences in vocalizations and their slight differences
in other attributes. The vocal differences noted by Lewis are the most significant
distinctions between these two species, and were also mentioned by Audubon
when he later described and painted the western meadowlark. Western meadowlarks
were also reported near <span class="tei_name">Missoula</span> on July 2, 1806. Their populations

of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, between the <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> nations; building their nests in
low grass." This must have been a mistaken attribution by Wilson, as neither the
habitat nor the nest site fits the ecology of this western forest-dwelling songbird.</p>

                     <p>Near the future site of <span class="tei_name">Fort Berthold</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, some "large white
cranes" were seen passing up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> on April 11, 1805. They were

These currently extremely rare and nationally endangered birds were also reported
from western <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span> by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>, but there is no other evidence
that whooping cranes ever occurred that far west, and so this identification
seems questionable.</p>

also present and may help account for the medicinal effects of sages. Collected

                     <strong>Silver-leaf Scurfpea <span class="italic">Psoralea (Pediomelum) argophylla</span>
                     </strong>
                     <p>This is a widespread perennial legume. The seeds are poisonous to humans,
but the plant is grazed to a slight extent by pronghorns and deer. The <span class="tei_name">Santee
Sioux</span> used a decoction for treating horse wounds, and many plains tribes made
a tea from its leaves for treating constipation. The ground-up foliage was also
mixed with grease and rubbed on the body to treat fever. Collected October 17,
1804, probably in present-day <span class="tei_name">Sioux County</span>, <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, near the <span class="tei_name">Cannonball
River</span>. A newly discovered species.</p>

<span class="italic">Machaeranthera pinnatifida (Haplopappus spinulosus)</span>
                     </strong>
                     <p>This is a widespread and hardy perennial forb that is highly drought-resistant.
Because of its spiny leaves, it is grazed very little by wildlife, and its possible use
by Native Americans is unknown. Collected September 15, 1804, in present-day
<span class="tei_name">Lyman</span> or <span class="tei_name">Brule County</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, near <span class="tei_name">Chamberlain</span>. A newly discovered

                     <strong>Western Red Cedar (Rocky Mountain Juniper)
<span class="italic">Juniperus scopulorum</span> FIG. 30</strong>
                     <p>A widespread evergreen shrub or small tree. Many western tribes made teas
from juniper roots or leaves, or smoked the green twigs, probably for their terpenelike
oils. The fruits were eaten raw or cooked, used as flavorings, or ground
up and used in cooking. A wax extracted from the berries was also used for making
candles. Collected October 2, 1804, probably in present-day <span class="tei_name">Sully</span> or <span class="tei_name">Porter</span>
County, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>.</p>

                     <p>This is a widespread perennial forb widely used by Native Americans for medicinal
purposes. For example, the <span class="tei_name">Santee Sioux</span> used it for earaches. A closely
related species, <span class="italic">P. senega</span>, was used by Native Americans as an antidote for many
kinds of poisoning, including snakebites. Collected August 10, 1806, probably in

                     <p>This is a widespread perennial legume. Native Americans made a tea of the
stems and leaves as a cure for fever; tea made from the roots was used for treating
headaches. The <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span> burned the roots as a mosquito repellant, and the
<span class="tei_name">Santee Sioux</span> boiled the roots to form part of a tuberculosis medicine. <span class="italic">Psoralea</span>
species produce a substance (psoralin) still under investigation for possible use
in several diseases, including immune-system diseases. Collected September 21,
1804, in present-day <span class="tei_name">Lyman County</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>, in the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend</span> region. A
newly discovered species.</p>
                     <p>The closely related breadroot scurfpea (<span class="italic">Psoralea esculenta</span>), also called Indian
breadfruit or prairie turnip, is widespread in the northern <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>
and has been described by Kelly Kindscher as "the most important wild food of
the Plains Indians." Its root was used by the <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> for making medicinal tea
or directly chewed for various ailments. A specimen was collected during the
expedition, but the date and location of its collection are questionable. Thus it
is given uncertain placement here.</p>
