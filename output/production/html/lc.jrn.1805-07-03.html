This morning early we employed all hands; some were making tar or attempting to make it, others were attatching the skins on the boat, other cuting and fiting the bark for lining puting in the woodworke &amp;c    some hunters <a href="#n16070301" id="ln16070301" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> were sent out to kill buffaloe in order to make pemecon to take with us and also for their skins which we now wa[n]t to cover our baggage in the boat and canoes when we depart from hence.    the Indians have informed us that we should shortly leave the buffaloe country after passing <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">the falls</a>; this I much regret for I know when we leave the buffaloe that we shal sometimes be under the necessity of fasting occasionally.    and at all events the white puddings will be irretreivably lost and <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Sharbono</a> out of imployment.    our tar-kiln which ought to have began to run this morning has yealded no tar as yet and I am much affraid will not yeald any, if so I fear the whole opperation of my boat will be useless. I fear I have committed another blunder also in sewing the skins with a nedle which has sharp edges these have cut the skin and as it drys I discover that the throng dose not fill the holes as I expected tho' I made them sew with a large throng for that purpose.    at 10 OCk A. M. we had a slight shower which scarcely wet the grass. One buffaloe only and 2 Antelopes killed today six beaver and 2 otter have been killed within the last three days. The current of the river looks so gentle and inviting that the men all seem anxious to be moving upward as well as ourselves.    we have got the boat prety well forward today and think we shall be able to complete her tomorrow except paying her, <a href="#n16070302" id="ln16070302" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> to do which will require some little time to make her first perfectly dry.    she has assumed her shape and looks extreemly well. She will be very light, more so than any vessel of her size that I ever saw. </p>
