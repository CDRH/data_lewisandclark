                  <span class="italic">Nine</span> Miles, the base of the Mound is a regular parallelagram the long Side of which is about 300 yards in length the Shorter 60 or 70 yards—    from the longer Side of the Base it rises from the North &amp; South with a Steep assent to the hight of 65 or 70 feet, leaveing a leavel Plain on the top of 12 feet in width &amp; 90 in length.    the North &amp; South part of this mound is joins by two regular rises, each in Oval forms of half its hight forming three regular rises from the Plain    the assent of each elivated part is as Suden as the principal mound at the narrower Sides of its Bass—</p>
               <p>
The reagular form of this hill would in Some measure justify a belief that it owed its Orrigin to the hand of man; but as the earth and loos pebbles and other Substances of which it was Composed, bare an exact resemblance to the Steep Ground which border on the Creek in its neighbourhood we Concluded it was most probably the production of nature—.</p>
               <p>
The only remarkable Charactoristic of this hill admiting it to be a naturial production is that it is insulated or Seperated a considerable distance from any other, which is verry unusial in the naturul order or disposition of the hills.</p>
               <p>
The Surrounding Plains is open void of Timber and leavel to a great extent: hence the wind from whatever quarter it may blow, drives with unusial force over the naked Plains and against this hill; the insects of various kinds are thus involuntaryly driven to the mound by the force of the wind, or fly to its Leward Side for Shelter; the Small Birds whoes food they are, Consequently 〈they are〉 resort in great numbers to this place in Surch of them; Perticularly the Small brown <a href="#n06082514" id="ln06082514" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Martin of which we saw a vast number hovering on the Leward Side of the hill, when we approached it in the act of Catching those insects; they were So gentle that they did not quit the place untill we had arrivd. within a fiew feet of them—</p>
               <p>
One evidence which the Inds Give for believeing this place to be the residence of Some unusial Spirits is that they frequently discover a large assemblage of Birds about this mound—    is in my opinion a Suffient proof to produce in the Savage mind a Confident belief of all the properties which they ascribe it.</p>
               <p>
from the top of this Mound we beheld a most butifull landscape; Numerous herds of buffalow were Seen feeding in various directions, the Plain to North N. W &amp; N E extends without interuption as far as Can be Seen—</p>
