The fogg was as thick as usual this morning    detained us untill ½ past 7 O'C. when we set out—    observed the Thermometer in the air to stand at 71° water 73°—    the fogg continued even with small difference between temperature of the air and water    [s]truck on a riffle which we got over with some difficulty and in the distance of two miles and a half passed 4 others three of which we were obliged to drag over with horses; the man charged me the exorbitant price of two dollars for his trouble.—    got on pretty well to <a class="regularization" title="Steubenville, Ohio" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Steubenville%2C%20Ohio">Steuwbenville</a>, <a href="#n02090601" id="ln02090601" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which we past at 2 Oc. being 6 M. from encam[pment]    hoisted our fore sale    found great relief from it    we run two miles in a few minutes when the wind becoming so strong we were obliged to hall it in lest it should carry away the mast, but the wind abating in some measure we again spread it; a sudan squal broke the sprete [sprit] and had very nearly carried away the mast, after which we firled an[d] secured it tho' the wind was so strong as to carry us pretty good speed by means of the arning and firled sails.—    struck on a riffle about two miles below the town    hoisted our mainsail to assist in driving us over the riffle    the wind blew so heard as to break the spreat of it, and now having no assistance but by manual exertion and my men woarn down by perpetual lifting I was obliged again to have recourse to my usual resort and sent out in serch of horses or oxen—    <a class="regularization" title="Steubenville, Ohio" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Steubenville%2C%20Ohio">Stewbenville</a> a small town situated on the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> in the state of <a class="regularization" title="Ohio" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio">Ohio</a> about six miles above <a class="regularization" title="Wellsburg, W.
