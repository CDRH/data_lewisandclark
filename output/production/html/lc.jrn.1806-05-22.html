The horse which the indians have given us to kill was driven away yesterday by the natives with a gang of their horses I presume in mistake; being without meat at noon we directed one of the largest of our colts to be killed.    we found the flesh of this animal fat tender and by no means illy flavoured.    we have three others which we mean to reserve for the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountains</a> if we can subsist here without them.    my horse which was castrated the day before yesterday wounded his thigh on the iner side with the rope by which he was confined that evening and is now so much swolen with the wound the castraiting and the collection of vermen that he cannot walk, in short he is the most wretched specticle; I had his wounds clensed of the vermen by washing them well with a strong decoction of the bark of the roots &amp; leaves of elder <a href="#n35052201" id="ln35052201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> but think the chances are against his recovery.    at 3 P.

These Indians are the most active horsemen I ever saw: they will gallop their horses over precipices, that I should not think of riding over at all.</p>
               <p>
The frames of their saddles are made of wood nicely jointed, and then covered with raw skins, which when they become dry, bind every part tight, and keep the joints in their places. The saddles rise very high before and behind, in the manner of the saddles of the Spaniards, from whom they no doubt received the form; and also obtained their breed of horses. <a href="#n35052207" id="ln35052207" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> When the Indians are going to mount they throw their buffaloe robes over the saddles and ride on them, as the saddles would otherwise be too hard.
