It rained the greater part of last night and continued untill 6 A. M. our grass tent is impervious to the rain.    the Child is more unwell than yesterday.    we gave it a doze of creem of tartar which did not operate, we therefore gave it a clyster <a href="#n35052501" id="ln35052501" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in the evening.    we caused a sweat to be prepared for the indian Cheif in the same manner in which <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton</a> had been sweated, this we attempted but were unable to succeed, as he was unable to set up or be supported in the place.    we informed the indians that we knew of no releif for him except sweating him in their sweat houses and giving him a plenty of the tea of the horsemint which we shewed them.    and that this would probably nos succeed as he had been so long in his present situation. I am confident that this would be an excellent subject for electricity and much regret that I have it not in my power to supply it.— <a href="#n35052502" id="ln35052502" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

There are also some of the Common black bear in this neghbourhood tho no So Comon as the other Species.</p>

we attempted to swet the sick indian but could not Suckceed.    he was not able either to Set up or be Supported in the place prepared for him.
