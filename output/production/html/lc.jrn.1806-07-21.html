We set out at sunrise and proceeded a short distance up the North side of the river; we found the ravines which made in on this side were so steep and numerous that we passed [<span class="italic">EC?: crossed</span>] the river in doing which the pack horse which carried my instruments missed the ford and wet the instruments.    this accident detained us about half an hor. I took the Instruments out wiped them and dryed their cases, they sustained no naterial injury.    we continued on the S. side of the river about 3 [<span class="italic">EC?: 3</span>] miles when we again passed over to the N. side and took our course through the plains at some distance from the river.    we saw a large herd of Elk this morning.    the buffaloe still become more scarce.    at 2 P. M. we struck a <a class="regularization" title="Cut Bank Creek (North Branch of Marias River)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Cut%20Bank%20Creek%20%28North%20Branch%20of%20Marias%20River%29">northern branch of Marias river</a>
