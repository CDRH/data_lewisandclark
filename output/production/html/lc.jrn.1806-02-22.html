We were visited today by two <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsop</a> women and two boys who brought a parsel of excellent hats made of Cedar bark and ornamented with beargrass.    two of these hats had been made by measures which <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> and myself had given one of the women some time since with a request to make each of us a hat; they fit us very well, and are in the form we desired them.    we purchased all their hats and distributed them among the party.    the woodwork and sculpture of these people as well as these hats and their waterproof baskets evince an ingenuity by no means common among the Aborigenes of America.    in the evening they returned to their village and <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> accompanied them in their canoe in order to get the dogs which the <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsops</a> have agreed to give us in payment for the Elk they stole from us some weeks since.    these women informed us that the small fish began to run which we suppose to be herring from their discription.    they also informed us that their Chief, <a class="regularization" title="Coboway" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Coboway">Conia</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Coboway" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Coboway">Comowooll</a>, had gone up the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> to the valley in order to purchase wappetoe, a part of which he in tended trading with us on his return.    one of our canoes brake the cord by which it was attatched and was going off with the tide this evening; we sent <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Sergt.
