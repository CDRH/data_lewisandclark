            <p>On November 12, 1795, two Hudson's Bay Company employees left their <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine River</span> post, <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>, with rival North West Company traders traveling to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages along the banks of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>. Although the <span class="tei_name">Montreal</span>-based North West Company had an established trade with the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>, this was the British company's first venture to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Over the next fifteen-odd years, Hudson's Bay Company traded regularly with the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>, receiving pelts, provisions, horses, and, incidentally, some interesting perceptions of first Spanish and then American efforts to discover a water passage through the continent. One of those efforts, the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition, drew more than just curious attention from Hudson's Bay and North West Company traders. Worried that Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s discoveries might trigger a rush of American traders to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> area and beyond, Hudson's Bay men tried to maintain their ties with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s by discrediting the Americans. There is even a hint that North West Company men tried to sabotage the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition. Their worries were not groundless. Within a few years of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s return, American traders came up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> with trade goods in hand eager to extract the finest pelts they could from the region. Faced with increased competition from the Americans, conflicts with Indian tribes along their trade routes, and then the disastrous intrusion of war between the United States and Great Britain, Hudson's Bay Company traders finally had to turn their backs on the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade in 1812. It was a brief chapter in Hudson's Bay Company's history, but through it we can see perhaps more clearly the web of international relationships operating in the fur trade on the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> in the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> period.</p>

        <div class="section  tei_div">
            <h4>International Rivalries</h4>
            <p>The quest for a Northwest Passage, or waterway to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, had brought the first European contact with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Indians in 1738 when French explorer <span class="tei_name">Pierre Gaultier de Varennes</span>, Sieur de la Verendrye reached the villages after traveling southwest from the middle <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine River</span>. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0101" id="lnlc.alwin.0101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Neither his journey nor the more extensive 1742 expedition by sons Louis and Francois, which also passed through the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, discovered a route to the <span class="tei_name">Western Sea </span>or an especially rich fur region. During the remainder of their tenure in the mid-continent, the French concentrated their western efforts further to the north in the <span class="tei_name">Lake Winnipeg</span> drainage.</p>
            <p>In accord with the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Seven Years War, the French withdrew from interior <span class="tei_name">North America</span>. Within a few years the vacuum left by the retreat of French fur traders from the western interior of <span class="tei_name">Canada</span> had been filled by a new breed of <span class="tei_name">Montreal</span>-based traders, commonly referred to as the Pedlars. They adopted many of the techniques of their predecessors, even occupying some of their posts. As the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was soon to discover, they were even more aggressive competitors than those they had replaced.</p>
            <p>The Pedlars, like the French before them, pursued an expansionist policy geared to carrying the trade to the natives in the continental interior, while the rival HBC continued to restrict its fur trading to several strategically located estuary posts on the shore of <span class="tei_name">Hudson Bay</span>. Since receiving its charter in 1670, the Bay Company, through its tidewater approach to the trade, had succeeded in attracting sufficient numbers of trading Indians, some of whom traveled great distances to trade at the Company's posts. But by the late 1760s and early 1770s it was obvious to HBC officers involved in the trade that the Company's traditional approach was inadequate. In the interior rival Pedlars intercepted trading Indians before they could get to HBC posts. Hudson's Bay men knew they had to change their operations to meet the competition.</p>

        <div class="section  tei_div">
            <h4>HBC Posts</h4>
            <p>Finally in the early 1770s the HBC <span class="tei_name">London</span> headquarters decided that it also would have to operate inland posts. In 1774 the HBC built its first full-fledged inland trading establishment, and in the decades that followed, several major Bayside posts thrust arms of settlement and trade into the continental interior in an effort to counter the formidable opposition, soon unified as the North West Company (NWC). The swiftness and spatial dimension of this expansion is distinctive in the annals of <span class="tei_name">North America</span>. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0102" id="lnlc.alwin.0102" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Albany Fort</span> was one of the Bayside posts to thrust a tentacle of trade inland. By 1790 <span class="tei_name">Albany</span> men had extended trade to the upper <span class="tei_name">Albany River</span> and in 1793 leapfrogged far to the west where they built <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> on the middle <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine River</span> near its junction with the Souris. The post immediately became operations center for its own trading network which soon included outposts farther upstream on the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span>, on the southern shore of <span class="tei_name">Lake Manitoba</span>, downstream on the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span>, as well as on the <span class="tei_name">Red River</span>.</p>
            <p>A seasonal transport routine quickly developed. Each spring fur returns from <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and its outposts were transported in twenty-odd foot bateaux more than 1300 miles to <span class="tei_name">Albany Fort</span>, or the somewhat shorter distance to <span class="tei_name">Martin's Falls Depot</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Albany River</span>. Trade goods and other essentials for the forthcoming trading season, that year's "outfit," were shuttled up from the Bayside each summer on a return trip in the same craft. This, then, was the situation in 1795 when the <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> traders inaugurated a distinctive new branch of their trade—one which reached beyond the Company's chartered lands and across the Hudson Bay drainage divide to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages in the central portion of present-day North Dakota.</p>
            <p>HBC traders at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> had seen first-hand evidence of the fruits of the NWC <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade since the post's first season. On December 22, 1793, founding Post Master <span class="tei_name">Donald MacKay</span> recorded the arrival of Canadian traders at the nearby Nor'Wester post with a large quantity of buffalo robes acquired at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. Two years later <span class="tei_name">Robert Goodwin</span>, his successor, decided the HBC should check into the potential of developing its own <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade. He understood that buffalo robes, which were used as cariole coverings in Montreal, were the Canadians' single most important trade item, although the agricultural <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s also had "Indn Maize, Kidney beans, Pumkins and grows many other things.. ." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0103" id="lnlc.alwin.0103" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>It was only with difficulty and the inducements of liquor and ammunition that <span class="tei_name">Goodwin</span> could convince the Canadians to allow the pair of HBC employees to tag along that November 1795 "to see the country &amp; what it produces." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0104" id="lnlc.alwin.0104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The Company judged this initial trip a success when the pair of HBC employees returned on December 26 with 142 Made Beaver (MB) <a href="#nlc.alwin.0105" id="lnlc.alwin.0105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> worth of furs and two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> horses. The Company promptly sent three more men back to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s with a new supply of trade goods. Thereafter, HBC and NWC trading parties raced each other to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0106" id="lnlc.alwin.0106" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

        <div class="section  tei_div">
            <h4>The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Trade</h4>
            <p>For more than a decade after the initial ventures of 1795–96, HBC employees or their representatives were routinely sent to the villages of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s, which they then usually referred to as the <span class="tei_name">Mandals</span> or <span class="tei_name">Mandalls</span>, as well as to those of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>  neighbors and allies, the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0107" id="lnlc.alwin.0107" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Although the Company's routine varied somewhat from year to year, the usual practice was to make two trips. The first party normally set out from <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> in late September or early October, soon after the new outfit of trade goods and supplies arrived at the post. All, or part, of this initial group usually arrived back at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> by Christmas. Shortly after recuperating from New Year's celebrations, they commenced preparations for the departure of the second trading expedition, which returned to <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> during March or April.</p>
            <p>Both Company employees and "freemen" conducted the HBC's <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>  trade. As their name suggests, freemen were not in the employ of any company. Equipped with up to 200 MB worth of HBC trade goods on credit, they commonly traveled to and from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s with the parties of one to six Company employees.</p>
            <p>The route between <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> followed the <span class="tei_name">Souris River</span> as much as possible to take advantage of firewood and protection of the river valley. To avoid a broad westerly bend in the river's course, traders left the <span class="tei_name">Souris</span> and struck out overland, passing along the west side of the forested <span class="tei_name">Turtle Mountain</span>, before rejoining the <span class="tei_name">Souris</span>. Farther downstream, east of present-day <span class="tei_name">Minot, North Dakota</span>, the river's course bends sharply to the northwest. Here, the route left the river for the last time and ran south to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. The one-way trip, estimated to be 150 to 200 miles depending on the exact route, generally required around ten days to travel. Depending on snow conditions, the mode of transport was horse and/or dog sled.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to determine the complete variety and quantity of trade goods sent to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s or the value of furs obtained there each year. But HBC men traveling to the villages evidently had a range of trade goods that included items as varied as tobacco, vermilion, beads, rings, looking glasses powder, shot, and guns. The last item may have been traded exclusively for horses.</p>
            <p>Determining the value of pelts obtained at the villages is also difficult because returns from <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and its outposts, including the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade, were routinely combined for accounting purposes. In some years, however, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> returns can be calculated from daily entries in the <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> Post Journal. Entries in the 1795–96 journal show a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade of 262 MB and four horses. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0108" id="lnlc.alwin.0108" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> That season the combined <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> trade totaled 4,207 MB; the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> contribution was smaller that year than in most succeeding seasons. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0109" id="lnlc.alwin.0109" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade contributed approximately 1,100 MB (and five horses) to <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and outpost trade in 1800–01. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0110" id="lnlc.alwin.0110" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Two years later this trade contributed ten per cent of the combined Assiniboine River trade of 5,486 MB. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0111" id="lnlc.alwin.0111" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Although a regular and expected source of pelts for <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> returns did not usually produce a significant addition to trade. In at least one year, however, the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> River returns were critical to <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>. The mild temperatures and lack of snow during the winter of 1799–1800 allowed buffalo to winter in the more open plains far away from their usual wintering grounds in the more forested Parkland belt where <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> was located. Without ready access to this important source of provisions, natives, who normally trapped at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>, worked almost full time in trying to stave off starvation and were not able to trap their normal supply of beaver. Rather than hunting and trapping beaver that winter, Indians frequented the post begging handouts of food. That season the <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and outpost trade totaled only 5,559 MB compared to the previous season's 8,023 MB. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0112" id="lnlc.alwin.0112" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> After packing that season's disappointing returns for shipment down to Hudson Bay, Post Master <span class="tei_name">Robert Goodwin</span> commented in the post journal on April 23, 1800, "my trade would have been very little had it not been for my men going two trips to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0113" id="lnlc.alwin.0113" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Several years earlier both HBC and NWC trade with the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> tribes were threatened. NWC traders arriving back at the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> in October of 1796 carried with them a proclamation forbidding "all forigners [sic] whatever (especially all British subjects)" <a href="#nlc.alwin.0114" id="lnlc.alwin.0114" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> from entering the newly-chartered lands of the Spanish Missouri Company.</p>

            <h4>Spanish Competition</h4>
            <p>Just as 1763 had marked the formal retreat of the French from <span class="tei_name">Western Canada</span>, it also marked the French withdrawal from <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span>, when <span class="tei_name">France</span> ceded that territory to <span class="tei_name">Spain</span>. By the early 1790s reports of British encroachments on the northern frontier of this Spanish territory reached <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. It was, in part, to counter this HBC and NWC intrusion from the north that <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants organized the Missouri Company in 1794. After earlier Missouri Company failures to reach the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, a party under <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span> finally succeeded in late September of 1796. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0115" id="lnlc.alwin.0115" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> wasted little time in trying to rout the British traders. He took possession of the NWC post at the villages and dispatched the proclamation to the British traders on the middle <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span>. The manifesto was not his own, but was that of his superior, <span class="tei_name">James MacKay</span>, who remained behind at <span class="tei_name">Fort Charles</span> downstream on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> in present-day <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>. Other correspondence followed between Evans and both James Sutherland at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and his counterpart <span class="tei_name">John McDonnell</span> at the nearby NWC post. Despite the proclamation forbidding British trade, it proved difficult to halt the well-established and mutually beneficial commerce between the village Indians and the British.</p>
            <p>The tenuity of <span class="tei_name">Evans</span>' control was demonstrated in February 1797 when two HBC traders arrived back with four fur-laden sleds. Although <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> barred the HBC men from trading directly with the Indians he personally accepted HBC trade goods in exchange for furs. Back at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> the pair of HBC men reported they had been greeted at the villages by "300 Indians who carried their Sleds on their Shoulders into the vilage [sic], so fond were they of the English. . ." In contrast the natives reportedly were "highly displeased with Evans," whose only recourse was to raise the Spanish flag in an effort to assert his authority. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0116" id="lnlc.alwin.0116" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Word reached <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> in spring that <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> had been forced to withdraw down the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> to <span class="tei_name">Fort Charles</span>. Prior to his retreat he almost came to "fisticuffs in attempting to prevent them [NWC men] from Trading with the natives. . ." By attempting to cut off trade with the British without an adequate supply of his own trade goods to offer in their place, <span class="tei_name">Evans</span> so angered the Indians that they threatened to kill him and his men if they refused to leave, "being greatly exasparated [sic] against them for preventing the Subjects of G. Britain from comming to Trade with them. .." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0117" id="lnlc.alwin.0117" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The Spanish claim to the territory and trade of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> especially distressed the NWC. To check out the location of the villages and to verify the Spanish claim they called on the services of their newly-acquired surveyor and geographer, <span class="tei_name">David Thompson</span>. An employee of the HBC since 1784, <span class="tei_name">Thompson </span>had deserted the Company for the NWC only six months prior to his late November 1797 arrival at the NWC post at the <span class="tei_name">Souris</span> mouth.</p>
            <p>HBC Post Master <span class="tei_name">John MacKay</span> extended the courtesy of inviting <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> to <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> for some hospitality, a usual practice among the fur traders. Disgruntled after the former HBC employee failed to show up, <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> wrote, "I did myself the honour to stay at home if that Astronomer wished to see me, I know no place he could find me sooner, than in my own House." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0118" id="lnlc.alwin.0118" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> With only four days to prepare for his <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> expedition, <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span> probably had little time or inclination to socialize, especially with an officer of his former employer. He headed south for the <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span> on November 28 and was back at McDonnell's (Assiniboine) House on February 3, having determined the latitude and longitude of two villages. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0119" id="lnlc.alwin.0119" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>

            </h4>
            <p>Six years later, entries in the <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> journal record the arrival at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> village of two other celebrated explorers—Meriwether <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and William <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Since <span class="tei_name">Thompson</span>'s trip, <span class="tei_name">Louisiana</span> had been retroceded to <span class="tei_name">France</span>, and in 1803 had become American territory. <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>, eager for an expedition into the trans-<span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> region and on to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, had begun planning for the expedition even before Louisiana became American soil. When the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition finally started up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> River in 1804, its aims were several. Two primary objectives were to explore the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> River and the possibility of a commercial communication with the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, and to note the potential for an American fur trade in the regions traversed. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0120" id="lnlc.alwin.0120" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> arrived at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages in late October of 1804, it was, in part, a quest for furs and a Northwest passage which had brought them; the same objectives which had earlier lured French and Spanish explorers and traders. Because of their regular link with the village Indians, British traders on the Assiniboine received occasional intelligence on this celebrated expedition.</p>
            <p>Even before starting construction of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, the expedition's wintering place near the villages, the American explorers encountered Assisiboine-based British traders in the vicinity. On November 1, 1804, shortly after their arrival at the villages, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dispatched a letter to the officer in charge of the NWC's Department of Assiniboia, stationed at a post several days travel upriver from <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0121" id="lnlc.alwin.0121" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> In the letter, they informed him of the expedition and its purpose and asked for any geographic information he might provide on the country into which the expedition was headed.</p>
            <p>Word of the expedition's arrival at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages may not have reached <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> until November 13, 1804. That day two Canadians arrived back from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villages where they reported seeing 150 Americans, an exaggeration of the actual forty-five in the expedition. More correctly, they reported that the entourage had arrived in three large boats—<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s keelboat and two large pirogues. Under the command of "Captn. Clerk &amp; Captn <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>" the group was reportedly bound for the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, but had to winter at the "Mandals." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0122" id="lnlc.alwin.0122" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Post Master <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> was surprised that the two Canadians who brought word of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition had not seen the three HBC men sent to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s on October 19—<span class="tei_name">George Budge</span>, <span class="tei_name">George Henderson</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Tom Anderson</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, however, noted their safe arrival at the villages in a November 8 entry in his journal. Writing at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> mentioned that the expedition's <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> interpreter had arrived back from the village and "informed us that three English men had arrived from the Hudson Bay Company. . ," <a href="#nlc.alwin.0123" id="lnlc.alwin.0123" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Although it was expected the HBC men would visit Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> the next day, it was not until December 1 that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> referred to <span class="tei_name">George Henderson</span>'s arrival at the fort. Fifteen days later <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded the arrival of <span class="tei_name">George Budge</span>, incorrectly referred to as "George Bunch" in his journal, along with two NWC clerks. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0124" id="lnlc.alwin.0124" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>

At <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> he delivered a letter from <span class="tei_name">George Budge</span> which indicated that there was really little prospect for additional trade with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s, for they were "so much taken with the Americans . . .”  <a href="#nlc.alwin.0125" id="lnlc.alwin.0125" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Nonetheless, when <span class="tei_name">Budge</span> and <span class="tei_name">Henderson</span> finally arrived back at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> on March 15, they brought an additional 424 MB with them. How much more information on <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> they brought back is unknown; Post Master <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> failed to mention the Americans in his journal on this occasion.</p>
            <p>On April 2, 1805, five days prior to the expedition's departure for the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, another mention is made of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. That day, unidentified Indians arrived directly from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages and expressed their displeasure with the Americans who had wintered near the villages. After talking with them <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> wrote, "they are not well pleased with them [the Americans].

            </p>
            <p>There appears to have been very little friction between HBC men and the expedition during <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s winter layover at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. The two incidents we know of, however, both involved <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>'s husband and a former Nor'Wester resident at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages who was hired by the expedition as an interpreter for the westward journey to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>.</p>
            <p>Arriving back at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> from a short trading foray on January 13, 1805, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> informed his superiors that an HBC employee had been speaking against the Americans. That day <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded "that the Clerk of the Hudson Bay Co. with the <span class="italic">Me ne tar res</span> [Minatarees or <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>] has been Speaking Some fiew expressns unfavourable towards us..." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0127" id="lnlc.alwin.0127" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> According to the <span class="tei_name">Coues</span> edition of the history of the expedition, on January 13, 1805, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> arrived back from a trip to the lodges of some <span class="tei_name">Minatarees</span> and informed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, that the agents of the Hudson's Bay Company at that place had been endeavoring to make unfavorable impressions with regard to us on the mind of the great chief, and the Northwest Company intended building a fort there. The great chief had in consequence spoken slightly of the Americans, but said that if we would give him our great flag he would come and see us. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0128" id="lnlc.alwin.0128" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The other point of friction between the expedition leaders and the HBC traders is less definite. This involved the possibility that HBC employees tried to dissuade <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> from continuing on with the expedition when it left the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s. On March 11, 1805, as the expedition's departure date from Fort <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> approached, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> entered in his journal, "We have every reason to believe that our <span class="italic">Menetarre</span> interpreter (whome we intended to take with his wife, as an interpreter through his wife to the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span> of which nation She is) has been Corrupted by the [blank in MS] Company &amp;c."  <a href="#nlc.alwin.0129" id="lnlc.alwin.0129" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">E. G. Chuinard</span>, an authority on <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, believes that the blank, which could not be deciphered in the original journal, "no doubt refers to the Hudson's Bay Company. . ." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0130" id="lnlc.alwin.0130" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> In the <span class="tei_name">Coues</span> history of the expedition there are additional details. The entry for March 17, 1805, includes the following passage:</p>
            <p>Our Minnetaree interpreter <span class="tei_name">Chaboneau</span>, whom we intended taking with us to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, had some days ago been worked upon by the British traders, and appeared unwilling to accompany us, except on certain terms—such as his not being subject to our orders, and his doing duty or returning whenever he chose. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0131" id="lnlc.alwin.0131" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>It may be inaccurate to interpret the blank in the <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> quote and the "British traders" in the <span class="tei_name">Coues</span> text as HBC traders. For one thing, the term "British" in the original journals of the expedition and the <span class="tei_name">Coues</span> history is used to refer to both the NWC and HBC or to either company and its men. And there were other circumstances suggesting that it was probably the NWC men, rather than the HBC employees, who tried to handicap the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition by convincing <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, and thus <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span>, to withdraw from the expedition.</p>
            <p>Three months after <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s reference to others' attempts to talk <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> into staying behind, Nor'Wester Francois <span class="tei_name">Antoine Larocque</span> started west from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages with a party of <span class="tei_name">Crow Indians</span> to explore the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River Valley</span>. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0132" id="lnlc.alwin.0132" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>On the previous winter's trip to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s he and other NWC traders had learned from <span class="tei_name">Crows</span> trading at the villages that “beavers were as numerous in their rivers as buffaloes and other large animals were in their plains or meadows..." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0133" id="lnlc.alwin.0133" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
               <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span>’s job was to verify these reports and to inaugurate trade with the <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>.</p>
            <p>When NWC first planned this <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> expedition is not known, but if there was even an inkling of such a trip by March 1805, the North West Company traders' concern over the continued westward passage of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition right through the heart of this promising fur trapping region is understandable. Hoping to handicap the Americans, it may have been the NWC men who tried to convince <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> to withdraw his services. It seems unlikely that HBC employees at the villages would be in a position to influence the ex-Nor'Wester, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>. Irrespective of who was responsible, the effort failed and <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> along with <span class="tei_name">Sacajawea</span> accompanied the expedition after all.</p>
            <p>When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned from the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> in 1806, they passed by the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Villages during the summer when HBC traders were busy conveying goods to and from the shore of <span class="tei_name">Hudson Bay</span>. As a result, it may not have been until December 20, 1806, when HBC traders returned from the first <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trip of the 1806–07 season, that the men at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> learned of the homeward passage of the expedition. The five men who returned that day reported that "Captn <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> with his Party passed the <span class="tei_name">Mandal</span> Village on their return to the <span class="tei_name">United States</span> last Summer &amp; that the Americans Intend to settle the <span class="tei_name">Mississouri</span> [sic] River at least as high up as the <span class="tei_name">Mandals</span>[.]" <a href="#nlc.alwin.0134" id="lnlc.alwin.0134" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>

            <h4>HBC Retreat</h4>
            <p>Although the Americans did not push settlement up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> the next year, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>'s triumphant return and their reports of plentiful furs in the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> country helped to encourage American traders. The traders wasted little time in exploring the new territory, but there was a more immediate threat to HBC trade with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>—ambushes by <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine Indians</span>. Conflict with the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> nearly terminated HBC trade in 1807 due to a particularly serious encounter, but contrary to what some historians have assumed trade continued after 1807.</p>
            <p>On the return of their second trip to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s in April 1807, HBC traders fell into the grasp of an <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> party. <span class="tei_name">George Budge</span> communicated the "Unfortunate Intelligince" on April 11 when he arrived back at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>. Later that day, Post Master <span class="tei_name">Thomas Vincent</span> described the incident in the House Journal:</p>
            <p>the <span class="tei_name">Assinaboils</span> had Robbed them of four of their Horses and stabbed two others one of them died on the Spot, the other he left unable to get up, three of the above Horses were bought during the winter at the <span class="tei_name">Mandals</span>[.] he has left <span class="tei_name">James Slater</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jacob Corrigale</span> With the furrs 3 days Journey from the <span class="tei_name">Mandal</span> Village the other 3 men with 3 horses are coming home with part of the Furrs, they likewise Robbed him of all his Provisions Ammunition, 2 new Guns, a part of his Furr &amp;c, in the Scuffle he himself and <span class="tei_name">Jacob Corrigale</span> were Nearly Stabbed by two of the Rascals whilst near 40 others Surrounded them with their Bows drawn, had they made further Resistance Inevitable Death must have been Ye Consequence[.] <a href="#nlc.alwin.0135" id="lnlc.alwin.0135" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>A week later <span class="tei_name">Budge</span> and four other men went back with six horses to fetch home the remaining furs, and by April 27 all men from the ill-fated party had safely made it back to <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span>.</p>
            <p>This was not the first time the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> had interfered with the Company's Missouri trade. Just three years earlier they had waylaid a party of HBC men en route to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s. Detained for several days by the hostiles, the traders were released only after paying dearly for their freedom with stocks intended for the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0136" id="lnlc.alwin.0136" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> tried to obstruct the Company's <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade for very good reasons. When peace prevailed between the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> and their sometime enemies, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s, the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> served as middlemen, supplying the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s with goods obtained at the British posts. This was a lucrative business for them and they obviously did not wish to see the HBC or any other traders interfere by carrying goods directly to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villages. When at war with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s, the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> understandably tried to stop the British Missouri trade which provided their enemies with guns, powder, and shot. For similar reasons, the <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span> also occasionally threatened the British-<span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trade.</p>
            <p>At times there was great hostility between the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboine</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> as was indicated in an account of HBC traders who arrived back from the villages in December 1801. The day prior to their departure for <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s killed eleven <span class="tei_name">Assiniboines</span> within half a mile of the village, and brought their heads and several other parts of their bodies back to the village to feed to the dogs. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0137" id="lnlc.alwin.0137" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Because of the possibility of further Indian attacks, Post Master <span class="tei_name">John MacKay</span> decided in 1807 not to send HBC employees to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s. He did, however, outfit a French Canadian and an Irish freeman for that trade, and they departed <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> in October 1807. The following spring <span class="tei_name">MacKay</span> received news that both freemen had been killed by the <span class="tei_name">Assiniboines</span>. This was contradicted by a later report which indicated that one, <span class="tei_name">La France</span>, had died of consumption and the other, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McCrachan</span>, was still at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, afraid to come home by himself. The second report proved the more truthful, and even though the Irishman did not return that trading season, he showed up empty-handed the next October. Outfitting him again with trade goods on credit, HBC promptly sent <span class="tei_name">McCrachan</span> back to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s in company with two Canadian traders. The party of three were back with five loaded horses by mid-December 1808.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1809 three Canadians arrived at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> with two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Indians from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> with word that "above 2 Hundred American Hunters gone up the Miss Sourie ..." Although <span class="tei_name">John MacKay</span> evidently knew little about the large American party, he quickly realized their trade potential. Within ten days all preparations had been made and four men left with the two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Indians for the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> "to trade with the Americans on the return . . ." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0138" id="lnlc.alwin.0138" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a> That party of Americans was the initial expedition of the newly-formed Missouri Fur Company, organized the previous winter by <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> and prominent St. Louis businessmen. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0139" id="lnlc.alwin.0139" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The Missouri Fur Company's first venture to the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> not only inaugurated the company's trade, but it also escorted <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>
               <span class="tei_name"> Chief Shahaka</span> to his village. On arrival in the fall of 1809, the company built a fort near the villages. There it was decided that <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> and expedition military commander <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau</span> would return to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. Then, two expedition parties were directed to <span class="tei_name">Fort Raymond</span>, the fort Lisa had built the previous year at the mouth of the Big Horn River. One group went via the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, while the other traveled overland to Fort Raymond. Members of these two parties were evidently the "above 2 Hundred American Hunters" reported at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> to have ascended the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>.</p>
            <p>Not all in the expedition proceeded to <span class="tei_name">Fort Raymond</span> or returned to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> that fall. Some remained behind to winter in the vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. These were the men who HBC traders referred to when they arrived back at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> on December 6, 1809. The post journal entry for that day records that they had ,,found a Compound of Mallatoes, Negroes Creoles and Canadians from the Illinois under a Mr Choteau who after settling his son at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>es returned to the Illinois[.]" <a href="#nlc.alwin.0140" id="lnlc.alwin.0140" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a> The "Mr. Choteau" referred to was undoubtedly <span class="tei_name">Pierre Chouteau, Sr.</span>, who had returned to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> with <span class="tei_name">Lisa</span>. Confronted with this situation at the villages, the HBC traders were for "carrying back immediately," but on their return to <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> a group of Indians threatened to plunder them if they did not accept their "offer" of a trade—700 poor quality wolves for the HBC trade goods. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0141" id="lnlc.alwin.0141" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>No attempt was made by the HBC to send even freemen to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villages in 1810. But during the 1811–12 season the HBC combined outfits with the NWC in a joint trading expedition for "mutual security, and to protect ourselves against the natives.. ." <a href="#nlc.alwin.0142" id="lnlc.alwin.0142" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Evidently there had been no plans to send men that season, but on December 23, 1811, an American and an old Canadian trader arrived at <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages to report that there were few Americans wintering on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. The pair suggested that the <span class="tei_name">Missouri Indians</span> there would be glad to trade with the British if they would send goods, as the villagers were discontented with the present traders. After some hesitation, both companies agreed to supply a portion of the goods, and to divide returns equally.</p>
            <p>By January 2 <span class="tei_name">William Yorston</span> and three other Company men had begun preparations for their trip to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. But three days later a skirmish between <span class="tei_name">Yorston</span> and his commanding officer at <span class="tei_name">Brandon</span> almost aborted the planned <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> trip. That day <span class="tei_name">Yorston</span>, who evidently had been attempting to "throw obstacles in the way" of the venture used "insulting language" with his superior, who promptly slapped him in the face. This led to a scuffle between the two, a rare occurrence at Company posts. <span class="tei_name">Yorston</span> wrestled down his opponent, who later that day wrote of the incident in the post journal: "[he] pounded away for eight or ten minutes twisting the hankerchief round my neck at the same time till I was almost strangled." Other details of the fight were not recorded, but <span class="tei_name">Yorston</span> finally did agree to accompany the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> expedition. His participation was essential since he was the only HBC employee at the post who knew both the route to the villages and the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> language. <a href="#nlc.alwin.0143" id="lnlc.alwin.0143" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The joint entourage left for the villages on January 8, with the HBC men taking four horses with sleds and four dog sleds to transport the returns. On March 14, 1812, the combined <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> River party returned with a "grand" total of 120 beaver skins, 4 buffalo robes, 14 wolves, and 2 bear skins.</p>
            <p>At the villages the British found trading difficult, for the Americans could offer the Indians "better encouragement." The Americans had become entrenched, despite the report to the contrary, and the British traders thought themselves lucky to escape with their meager take of furs. In less than three months the two nations would be at war; a war that disrupted fur trading from the <span class="tei_name">Great Lakes</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Coast</span>. This 1812 expedition ended HBC attempts to maintain a regular trade link between <span class="tei_name">Brandon House</span> and the village Indians of the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. The war cut off trade and effectively severed Company ties with this distinctive area which, for more than a decade, had proved to be a valuable source for pelts, provisions and perceptions.</p>

            <h4>Author's Note on Sources</h4>
            <p>On May 2, 1670, the charter granting Rupert's Land to the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay, more commonly referred to as the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), received the Great Seal of England. This charter granted the Company "sole Trade and Commerce" within the drainage basin of Hudson Bay and Strait, a vast domain of more than one million square miles. During succeeding decades Company fur trading activity expanded beyond the limits of Rupert's Land on many fronts to include almost all of mainland <span class="tei_name">Canada</span> and reached south into northern and western sections of the <span class="tei_name">United States</span>.</p>
            <p>Archives of the Hudson's Bay Company were the principal source of information for this article. The archives deal mainly with Company transactions in <span class="tei_name">North America</span> and include documents such as post journals, post account books, various types of correspondence, individuals' journals, district reports, maps and sketches. Canadian and British scholars have used these corporate archives for decades—American scholars can almost certainly make greater use of this important source for historical research.</p>
            <p>Company records from 1670 to 1870 were made available to scholars at <span class="tei_name">Beaver House</span>, the Company headquarters in <span class="tei_name">London, England</span>, beginning in the early 1930s. Since 1966 researchers in <span class="tei_name">North America</span> have had access to the positive microfilm copies of the archives, up to 1870, in the Public Archives of Canada, Ottawa. In 1974, following the move of the head office of the HBC from <span class="tei_name">London</span> to <span class="tei_name">Winnipeg, Manitoba</span>, four years earlier, the 4200-plus linear feet of the archives were moved to their new quarters in the Manitoba Provincial Archives and Library in <span class="tei_name">Winnipeg</span>. All post journals to 1940, as well as other selected post-1900 documents, are now open to researchers. Additional 20th century documents are made available as they are classified.</p>
            <p>I was introduced to the archives in the summer of 1973 when I started my dissertation research on the historical geography of HBC transportation between 1670 and 1821. I relied on the microfilms of the archives in <span class="tei_name">Ottawa, Ontario</span>, and the next year, even before their official opening date, I became one of the first researchers to use the archives at their new home in <span class="tei_name">Winnipeg</span>.</p>
            <p>I want to thank Drs. <span class="tei_name">John Ewers</span> of the Smithsonian Institution, <span class="tei_name">Barry Kaye</span> with the Department of Geography at the University of Manitoba, and <span class="tei_name">Michael Malone</span> of the Department of History at Montana State University for commenting on an earlier draft of this paper. I also acknowledge the Hudson's Bay Company for permission to consult, and quote from, its archives. Special thanks are extended to Mrs. <span class="tei_name">Shirlee Smith</span>, HBC archivist, for granting an eager graduate student access to the archives even in advance of their official opening date in Winnipeg.</p>
