This morning early I sent out the hunters, and set several additional hands about the packsaddles. I find that the sturgeon <a href="#n31041701" id="ln31041701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is not taken by any of the natives above the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbean</a> vally.    the inhabitants of the rapids at this time take a few of the white salmon trout and considerable quantities of a small indifferent mullet <a href="#n31041702" id="ln31041702" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> on which they principally subsist. I have seen none except dryed fish of the last season in the possession of the people above that place, they subsist on roots principally with some dryed and pounded fish.    the salmon not having made their appearance proves a serious inconvenience to us.    but few of the natives visited my camp today and those only remained a few hours.    even at this place which is merely on the border of the <a class="regularization" title="Great Columbian Plain" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Great%20Columbian%20Plain">plains of Columbia</a> the climate seems to have changed the air feels dryer and more pure.    the earth is dry and seems as if there had been no rain for a week or ten days.    the plain is covered with a rich virdure of grass and herbs from four to nine inches high and exhibits a beautifull seen particularly pleasing after having been so long imprisoned in mountains and those almost impenetrably thick forrests of the seacoast. <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Feilds</a> brought me today three eggs of the party coloured corvus, <a href="#n31041703" id="ln31041703" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> they are about the size and shape of those of the pigeon.    they are bluish white much freckled with dark redish brown irregular spots, in short it is reather a mixture of those colours in which the redish brwn predominates, particularly towards the larger end.—    This evening <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Willard</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Cruzatte</a> returned from <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

I preserved a specemine of it.

I rose early and took a position near to the village and exposed the artiles I had for Sale Great numbers of Indians Came from different derections, Some from below Some above and others across the Countrey from the <a class="regularization" title="Yakima (Tapteete) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yakima%20%28Tapteete%29%20River">Tapteet river</a> See description of the Nations &amp;c.—    I obtained a Sketch of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> as also <a class="regularization" title="Deschutes (Clark's, Towanahiook's) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deschutes%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Towanahiook%27s%29%20River">Clarks river</a>.    <span class="italic">See sketch</span>

I rose early after bad nights rest, and took my merchindize to a rock which afforded an elegable Situation for my purpose, and at a Short distance from the houses, and divided the articles of merchindize into parsels of Such articles as I thought best Calculated to pleas the Indians, and in each parcel I put as many articles as we could afford to give, and thus exposed them to view, informing the Indians that each parcel was intended for a horse.    they tanterlised me the greater part of the day, Saying that they had Sent out for their horses and would trade as Soon as they Came. Several parcels of merchindize was laid by for which they told me they would bring horses. I made a bargin with the Chief for 2 horses, about an hour after he canseled the bargin and we again bargained for 3 horses which were brought foward, only one of the 3 could be possibly used the other two had Such intolerable backs as to render them entirely unfit for Service. I refused to take two of them which displeased him and he refused to part with the 3rd. I then packed up the articles and was about Setting out for the Village above when a man Came and Sold me two horses, and another man Sold me one horse, and Several others informed me that they would trade with me if I would Continue untill their horses could be drove up.    this induced me to Continue at this Village another day. Maney of the nativs from different villages on the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> above offered to trade, but asked Such things as we had not and double as much of the articles which I had as we could afford to give.    this was a very unfavourable circumstance as my dependance for precureing a Sufficiency of horses rested on the Suckcess above where I had reasons to believe there were a greater abundance of those animals, and was in hopes of getting them on better terms. I purchased 3 dogs for the party with me to eate and Some Chap-pa-lell for my Self.    before precureing the 3 horses I dispatched <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Crusat</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Willard</a> &amp; <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Weiser, Peter" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Weiser%2C%20Peter">Peter Wiser</a> to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt Lewis</a> at the <a class="regularization" title="Fort Rock Camp (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Rock%20Camp%20%28Oreg.%29">Rock fort Camp</a> with a note informing him of my ill Suckcess in precureing horses, and advised him to proceed on to this place as Soon as possible.    that I would in the mean time proceed on to the <a class="regularization" title="Tenino Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tenino%20Indians">Enesher</a> Nation above the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great falls</a> and try to purchase Some horses of that people.
