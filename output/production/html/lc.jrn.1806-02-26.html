I have never seen the animal and can therefore discribe it only from the skin and a slight view which some of our hunters have obtained of the living animal.    the skin when dressed is from 14 to 18 inches in length and from 7 to 9 in width; the tail is always severed from the skin in forming their robes I cannot therefore say what form or length it is.    one of the men informed me that he thought it reather short and flat.    that he saw one of them run up a tree like a squirrel and that it returned and ran into a hole in the ground.    the ears are short thin pointed and covered with short fine hair.    they are of a uniform colour, a redish brown; tho' the base of the long hairs, which exceed the fur but little in length, as well as the fur itself is of a dark colour for at least two thirds of it's length next to the skin.    the fur and hair are very fine, short, thickly set and silky.    the ends of the fur and tips of the hair being of the redish brown that colour predominates in the ordinary appearance of the animal. I take this animal to be about the size of the barking squirrel of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>.    and beleive most probably that it is of the Mustela genus, <a href="#n28022602" id="ln28022602" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> or perhaps the brown mungo <a href="#n28022603" id="ln28022603" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> itself. I have indeavoured in many instances to make the indians sensible how anxious I was to obtain one of these animals entire, without being skined, and offered them considerable rewards to furnish me with one, but have not been able to make them comprehend me. I have purchased several of the robes made of these skins to line a coat which I have had made of the skins of the tiger cat.    they make a very pleasant light lining.    the <span class="italic">Braro</span>

I have in two instances out run this animal and caught it.    in this rispect they are not much more fleet than the porcupine.
