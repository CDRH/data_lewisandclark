Having travelled 2 miles we reached the mountains which are very steep; but the road over them pretty good, as it is much travelled by the natives, who come across to the <a class="regularization" title="Bitterroot (Clark's, Flathead) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Bitterroot%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%29%20River">Flathead river</a> to gather cherries and berries.

At noon we halted at a branch of the creek, <a href="#n22091207" id="ln22091207" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> on the banks of which are a number of strawberry vines, haws, and service berry bushes. At 2 we proceeded on over a large mountain, where there is no water, and we could find no place to encamp until late at night, when we arrived at a small branch, and encamped by it, in a very inconvenient place, 
having come 23 miles.

Thursday Septemr. 12th    This morning Clear weather with white frost &amp; our hunters went out early to hunt; We loaded up our horses, and set out on our Journey, soon after sun rise, &amp; proceeded on a short distance &amp; took up 
to the Mountains, which were on their Tops cover'd with Pitch pine trees.    We then continued ascending &amp; descending Mountains &amp; bad hills &amp; crossed several Runs.—</p>
               <p>
About 1 oClock P. M. we descended a bad part of the Mountains, which was nearly steep, &amp; came down on the Creek which we had left,—    where we halted to dine &amp; where our hunters came to us, &amp; had killed 4 Deer &amp; a 
Pheasant which they brought to us, We halted for one hour &amp; proceeded on, and crossed 2 Creeks, and ascended a high rough rockey mountain, &amp; followed a very rough trail.    We proceeded on along the ridge of one of these mountains which was covered with Pitch pine timber.    Night came on and we travelled in the dark, through thickets of pine Trees, &amp; passed over logs &amp; bad places untill about 10 o'Clock P. M. before we could get to a place where water was convenient to encamp at, which was at a steep part of the Mountain, which we descended down to a Creek, being the same which we 
had left at noon.    We encamped on this Creek, where we had scarcely Room to lay down to Sleep, 〈on〉 having come about 17½ Miles this day.—    We found here, very little food for our horses, and saw Mountains this day which lay to the South of us covered with Snow, which lies on those Mountains during the whole Year.—
