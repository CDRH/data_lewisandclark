There is a species of bryer which is common in this neighbourhood of a green colour which grows most abundant in the rich dry lands near the watercourses, but is also found in small quantities in the piny lands at a distance from the watercourses    in the former situation the stem is frequently the size of a man's finger and rises perpendicularly to the hight of 4 or 5 feet when it decends in an arch and becomes procumbent or rests on some neighbouring plants or shrubs; it is simple unbranched and celindric; in the latter situation it is much smaller and usually procumbent.    the stem is armed with sharp and hooked bryers.    the leaf is peteolate ternate and resembles in shape and appearance that of the perple raspberry common to the Atlantic states.    the fruit is a berry resembling the black berry in every rispect and is eaten when ripe and much esteemed by the natives but is not dryed for winter consumption.    in the country about the entrance of the <a class="regularization" title="Sandy (Quicksand) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Sandy%20%28Quicksand%29%20River">quicksand river</a> I first discovered this bryer.    it groows so abundantly in the fertile valley of <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> and the Islands in that part of the river that the countrey near the river is almost impenitrable in many places.    the briary bush with a wide leaf is also one of it's ascociates.    the green bryer retains it's foliage and verdure untill late in December.— There are also two species of firn which are common to this country beside that formerly discribed of which the natives eat the roots.    these from their disparity in point of size I shall designate the large and small firn.    both species continue green all winter.— The <em class="hi">large firn,</em>
