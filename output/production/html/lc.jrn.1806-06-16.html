                  <em class="hi">Monday 16th.</em>    We had a pleasant morning, and renewed our journey; went up a handsome creek about three miles, and then took to the hills which are very rough, with a great many banks of snow, some of them four or five feet deep. These banks are so closely packed and condensed, that they carry our horses, and are all in a thawing state. We halted for dinner at a handsome stream where there was some grass for our horses; and in about two hours proceeded on again, and had some rain. In the afternoon we found the snow banks more numerous, extensive and deep: in some of them the snow as much as eight feet deep. In the evening we came to <a class="regularization" title="Hungery Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Hungery%20Creek">Hungry
