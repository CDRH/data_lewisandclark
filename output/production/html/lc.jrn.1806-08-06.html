A little after dark last evening a violent storm arrose to the N. E. and shortly after came on attended with violent Thunder lightning and some hail; the rail fell in a mere torrant and the wind blew so violently that it was with difficulty I could have the small canoes unloaded before they filled with water; they sustained no injury.    our situation was open and exposed to the storm.    in attending to the canoes I got wet to the skin and having no shelter on land I betook myself to the orning of the perogue which I had, formed of Elkskin, here I obtained a few hours of broken rest; the wind and rain continued almost all night and the air became very cold.    we set out early this morning and decended the river about 10 miles below <a class="regularization" title="Poplar (Porcupine) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Poplar%20%28Porcupine%29%20River">Porcupine river</a>

I rose very wet.    about 11 P M last night the wind become very hard for a fiew minits Suckceeded by Sharp lightning and hard Claps of Thunder and rained for about 2 hours very hard after which it continued Cloudy the balance of the night.    as we were about Setting out a female Big horn animal came on the bluff imediately above us and looked down. I derected <a class="regularization" title="Labiche, François" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Labiche%2C%20Fran%C3%A7ois">Labeech</a> to Shoot it which he did, after Skinning this animal we Set out and proceeded on to a Sand bar on the S W.

I halted on the N W.

This morning a very large Bear of white Specis, discovered us floating in the water and takeing us, as I prosume to be Buffalow imediately plunged into the river and prosued us. I directed the men to be Still.    this animal Came within about 40 yards of us, and tacked about.    we all fired into him without killing him, and the wind So high that we could not pursue hi[m], by which means he made his escape to the Shore badly wounded. I have observed buffalow floating down which I suppose must have been drounded in Crossing above.    more or less of those animals drown or mire in passing this river. I observed Several floating buffalow on the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">R.

I derected the men to dress their Skins except one which I took with me and walkd. through the bottom to the foot of the hills    I killed five deer and the man with me killed 2.    four others were killed in the Course of the day by the party only 2 of those deer were fat owing as I suppose to the Musquetors which are So noumerous and troublesom to them that they Cannot feed except under the torments of millions of those Musquetors.

                  <em class="hi">Wednesday 6th.</em>    We embarked early, and had a fine morning, but high wind. At 12 o'clock the wind blew so violent that it became dangerous to go on, and we halted; and some of the men went out and shot a large buck, but not dead and he got into the river; when two of them pursued in a canoe and caught him. Having remained here three hours, we again went on until night and encamped. We have yet seen nothing of the two hunters who had been left behind in the small canoe.
