The Lewis and Clark project, that is the project to edit the journals of the expedition, came to the state of Nebraska and the University of Nebraska because Nebraskans had interest. The University of Nebraska Press, the Center for Great Plains Studies, the University of Nebraska, and the state of Nebraska supported the project financially for 20 years. So it was a great commitment by the state, by the center, by the university that made it happen. I think in later years, as the project was going on, people in Missouri and Oregon and Washington and Montana wished they'd had that idea. Because now the glory comes to our state and our university and our publishing house. </p>
