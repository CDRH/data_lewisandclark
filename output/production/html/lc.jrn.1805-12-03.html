                  <span class="italic">Tuesday 3rd.</span>    The morning was foggy. About 9 o'clock the men came in with the meat of the elk.— They had a disagreeable trip, it being dark before they arrived at the place where the elk had been killed; and the darkness, fallen timber and under-brush prevented their return; so that they had to encamp out all night. Six of the natives came to our camp, the first who have appeared since our arrival, and after staying an hour proceeded down the river. The greater part of the day was fair, but in the evening it clouded over and rained again. At dark our other two hunters came in, and had killed 6 elk some distance from the river.
