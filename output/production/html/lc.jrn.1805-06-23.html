This morning early I scelected a place for the purpose of constructing my boat near the water under some shady willows. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> had the Canoe and baggage brought up, after which we breakfasted and nearly consumed the meat which he had left her[e].    he now set out on his return with the party.
