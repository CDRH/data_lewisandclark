               <p>
Tuesday October 22nd    A clear pleasant morning &amp; We set out soon after Sun rise &amp; proceeded on down the River, we passed several fishing Camps of Indians, lying on the North side of the River, and high Clifts of dark colour'd Rock lying on both sides of it.—    We also saw an Island of Rocks, which had towers of solid Rock on it, and a very rough roaring rapid, lying on the North side of the River, on which lies the main Channel &amp; body of it; We proceeded down at this place on the South side of the River &amp; found a small River, which emtied into the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> on the same side.    It appeared to be about 40 Yards wide, &amp; fell into it opposite to the lower part of the Rockey Island.    This River was called the <a class="regularization" title="Deschutes (Clark's, Towanahiook's) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deschutes%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Towanahiook%27s%29%20River">Sho-sho-ne</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Deschutes (Clark's, Towanahiook's) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Deschutes%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Towanahiook%27s%29%20River">Clark's River</a>.    We saw high hills &amp; Clifts of rocks, which lay on both sides of the River, the highest of which lies on the North side of it.    We found that the Natives had fishing Seins which we saw during this day, and catch the greatest abundance of fish with them in the Spring of the Year.    The Sand this day, lays in great abundance along the Shores.—    We continued on to the lower end of the Island before mention'd this day, (which we supposed to be at least 4 Miles in length) &amp; found a great number of fishing Camps, a short distance below it, We came here, to the first falls of <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> where we halted, for a 
short time a small distance above it, about noon.    The Natives at this place came to us, and we purchased from them some pounded Salmon, &amp; Root bread, which they had brought with them.—    We found the Natives to be very numerous about those falls.    They had a number of lodges made out of Flags &amp; Cedar bark, and Cabbins built out of same kind of Cedar wood &amp; covered with Bark; we found also among them, large quantities of dried Salmon, which they had in grass bags of their own manufacture, &amp; we saw a number of small Canoes lying along the Shores of the River.    We saw a number of handsome horses feeding in the plains which belonged to the Natives.    These falls were perpendicular &amp; we found them by measurement to be about 37 feet 8 Inches feet high, &amp; full of Solid Rocks which by the force of the rapidity of the Waters running, are cut into many Channels.    And a constant mist rises at this place occasioned by the great fall of Water.    The River at this place 〈is〉 was considerable narrower than it was a few Miles above it.—</p>
               <p>
The Rocks &amp; Clifts lay very high near to the River; on both sides of these falls; &amp; the Water falling in such an immense quantity, makes a roaring that can be heard several miles below it.    We found that we should be forced to make a portage of about ¾ of a Mile to get where we could again load our Canoes with safety, to proceed on our Voyage.    Our Men were set to carrying on their backs all our Goods baggage &amp;ca. and our officers hired from the Natives a few horses, to carry the most weighty part of it.    We got all our baggage safe below these falls, in the Evening and encamped on the North side of the River, close to a high range of Clifts of rocks, where the Main body of the Water ran against them &amp; formed a very large Eddy.—    The Natives made signs to us, which we understand to be that about 6 Miles below this falls, that we shall come to another great falls.    We saw a number of Sea Otters, in and about these falls.    We found the Natives here very troublesome about our camp and we 〈are〉 were forced to watch them, for fear of their stealing from us.—    These Natives informed us by signs, that some White people had been at this place, but that they had gone 4 or 5 days Journey down the River.    The perpendicular hight of the Clifts were we are encamped, is about 250 feet high.    We came about 35 Miles this day our course being as usual West.—
