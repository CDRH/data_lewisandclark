Friday 27th June 1806.    a fair morning.    we took an eairly breakfast and proceeded on verry fast over the high banks of Snow    the most part of the day and bad mountains.    we came further to day than we went in 2 when we came over.    and Camped <a href="#n36062713" id="ln36062713" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> on the South Side of a mountain where our horses find a little grass.    the day warm and Snow melts fast.—

                  <span class="italic">Friday 27th.</span>    We had a cloudy morning and at 8 o'clock we renewed our march, proceeding over some of the steepest mountains I ever passed. The snow is so deep that we cannot wind along the sides of these steps, but must slide straight down. The horses generally do not sink more than three inches in the snow; but sometimes they break through to their bellies. We kept on without halting to about 5 o'clock in the evening, when we stopped at the side of a hill where the snow was off, and where there was a little grass; and we here encamped for the night. The day was plesant throughout; but it appeared to me somewhat extraordinary, to be travelling over snow six or eight feet deep in the latter end of June. The most of us, however, had saved our socks as we expected to find snow on these mountains.
