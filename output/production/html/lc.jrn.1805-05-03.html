The morning being very could we did not set out as early as usual; ice formed on a kettle of water ¼ of an inch thick.    the snow has melted generally in the bottoms, but the hills still remain covered.    on the lard side at the distance of 2 miles we passed a curious collection of bushes which had been tyed up in the form of a faciene <a href="#n12050301" id="ln12050301" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and standing on end in the open bottom    it appeared to be about 30 feet high and ten or twelve feet in diameter, this we supposed to have been placed there by the Indians, as a sacrefice for some purpose. The wind continued to blow hard from the West but not so strong as to compel us to ly by.    <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> walked on shore and killed an Elk which he caused to be butched by the time I arrived with the party, here we halted and dined being about 12 OCk. our usual time of halting for that purpose.    after dinner <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
