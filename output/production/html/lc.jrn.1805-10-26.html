A number of Indians came to the Oposit Side of the river in the fore part of the day and Shew that they were anxious to Cross to us, we did not think proper to cross them in our Canoes and did not Send for them.    in the evening <span class="italic">two</span> Chiefs and 15 men came over in a Small Canoe, those two Chiefs proved to be the two Principal chiefs of the tribes above at the falls, and above, who was out hunting at the time we passed their bands; one of those Chiefs made <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt Lewis</a> and my Self each a Small present of Deer meat, and Small Cakes of white bread made of roots.    we gave to each Chief a Meadel of the Small Size a red Silk handkerchief, arm band, Knife &amp; a piece of Paint, and acknowledged them as chiefs; as we thought it necessary at this time to treat those people verry friendly &amp; ingratiate our Selves with them, to insure us a kind &amp; friendly reception on our return, we gave Small presents to Several, and half a Deer to them to eate.    we had also a fire made for those people to Sit around in the middle of our Camp, and <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Peter Crusat</a> played on the violin, which pleased those nativs exceedingly.    the two Chiefs and several men deturmined to delay all night (<a class="regularization" title="York" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=York">yorked</a> Danced for the Inds) with us    all the others returned, leaving the horses for those who Staied on the opposit Side. our hunters returned in the evening Killed five Deer, four verry large grey Squirels and a grouse.    one of the guard at the river guiged a Salmon Trout, which we had fried in a little Bears Oil which the Chief we passed below the narrows gave us: 〈thought this〉 this I thought one of the most delicious fish I have ever tasted</p>

Great numbers of white Crain flying in different Directions verry high—    The river rose 8 Inches to day from what cause I cannot Say certainly, as the tides cannot effect the river here as there is a falls below, I conjecture that the rise is owing to the winds which has Set up the river for 24 hours past.    our hunters inform that the countrey back is broken, Stoney and thinly timbered with pine and White Oake. They Saw Elk &amp; Bear Sign in the mountains. Dried all our wet articles and repared our Canoes to day, and the Party amused themselves at night danceing.

Saturday October 26th    A clear pleasant morning, and we continued at our Encampment near the point of rocks, with 2 Centinals placed to guard us.    Our hunters were sent out in order to hunt for game.    Our officers 
mean to delay here this day in order to ascertain the Latitude of this place, repair our Canoes &amp;ca.    We unloaded our Canoes, shaved their bottoms clean, payed them over with Pitch.    We also put the loading that had got 
wet, in the Canoe Yesterday Out in order to dry 〈them〉.    We had a number of the Natives at our Camp, to visit us.    One of our party gigged a large Salmon Trout in the River, which he brought to our Camp.    Towards Evening our hunters returned to the Camp.    They had killed 5 deer, 1 Goose &amp; a grey squirrel.    They informed us, that they had seen a great number of deer, in the timbered land, We saw a great number of Ducks, &amp; Geese in the River this day.—    The Indians came to our Camp this day, on Crafts made out of Cedar Wood.    These Crafts were made in the form of a Skiff, for the convenience of riding the Waves in high winds; or to coast along the Sea 
shore.—    They were neatly formed &amp; dug out.—    Several of these Indians staid with us all Night, among which was one of their Chiefs.—    <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> compared the language of these Indians, with the different languages that he had taken down in writing, of all the Indians that we had seen on this side of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rockey Mountains</a>, &amp; found them to be the same Nation, &amp; to differ but little in their languages, which is occasioned by the different tribes of them, being scattered such a long distance from each other &amp; all the way 〈thick〉 numerous along the <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Kio-me-num</a> &amp; <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia </a>Rivers &amp; to the heads of all the Rivers that run into them.—</p>
               <p>
Our Officers as well as the Men, are of oppinion that all the Indians that we met with (since we first met with the <a class="regularization" title="Flathead Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Flathead%20Indians">flatt head</a> Indians) belong to that Nation; &amp; from the best calculation that we can make suppose them to be Ten thousand Men strong 〈in all,〉    The <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> began to rise at about 4 o'Clock P. M. and raised several Inches.    The cause of which we suppose to be from the flowing of the tide, which occasions the swell at this place.—    The place we are at lies in Latitude 45° 0' North &amp; called the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, The Dalles of the (Great Narrows)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20The%20Dalles%20of%20the%20%28Great%20Narrows%29">long Narrows of Columbia River</a>.
