I have discovered that the shrub and fruit discribed on the 26th of January is not that which the Indians call the <em class="hi">Shal-lon,</em> but that is such as is there discribed, and the berry is estemed and used by the natives as there mentioned except that it is not like the shallon, baked in large loaves, but is simply dryed in the sun for winter uce, when they either eat them in thir dryed state or boil them in water.
