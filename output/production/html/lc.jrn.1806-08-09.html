I killed 3 of the deer which were Meagure the Elk appeared fat. I did not kill any of them as the distance to the river was too great for the men to Carry the meat    at the lower part of this bottom a large Creek of runnig water 25 yds wide <a href="#n37080903" id="ln37080903" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> falls in which meanders through an open roleing plain of great extent.    in the low bottoms of this Creek I observed Some timber Such as Cottonwood, ash &amp; Elm.    on my arival at the lower part of the bottom found that the canoes had been in waiting for me nearly two hours. The <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Squar</a> brought me a [<em class="hi">NB: 1800 Miles up the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> I found a</em>] large and well flavoured Goose berry <a href="#n37080904" id="ln37080904" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> of a rich Crimsin Colour, and deep purple berry of the large Cherry of the Current Speces <a href="#n37080905" id="ln37080905" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> which is common on this river as low as the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandans</a>, the engagees Call it the Indian Current.
