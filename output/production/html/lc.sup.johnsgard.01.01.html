            <h3>Historical Overview</h3>
            <p>When <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> set off up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri
River</span> in mid-May of 1804 with their 26-man contingent (3 sergeants,
22 privates, and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> slave <span class="tei_name">York</span>) and about 10 additional
boatmen and interpreters, they had no detailed knowledge of what lands or
adventures lay before them. When the group returned more than two years
later, in late September of 1806, they had made more discoveries of landscapes,
rivers, native cultures, zoology, and botany of our continent than has any North
American scientific expedition, either before or since. They traversed upstream
across the entire <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> region, which for present purposes is defined as
including that part of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley between the current <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>-<span class="tei_name">Kansas</span>
border and the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, where three mountain-fed
rivers merge to form the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. By the time they reached what is now western
<span class="tei_name">Montana</span> in late July of 1805 and were about to challenge the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>, they
had already ascended nearly 4,000 feet of elevation. They also had explored and
carefully described roughly 2,500 river miles of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley since leaving
the <span class="tei_name">Mississippi River</span>, a task that by itself represents a heroic if not Herculean
physical effort.</p>
            <p>Over the 14-month period during which the explorers crossed the <span class="tei_name">Great
Plains</span> on their way to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> they collected specimens of plants later found
to represent at least 20 new species, not counting an unknown number of additional
specimens that either were lost or damaged beyond repair in the course
of the expedition or have disappeared from any present-day museum or herbarium
records. </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> also discovered or carefully described for the first time at
least seven <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> species of mammals, including the pronghorn, grizzly
bear, swift fox, black-tailed prairie dog, white-tailed jackrabbit, bushy-tailed
woodrat, and mule deer. The Columbian ground squirrel was first encountered,
and thus discovered, in western <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, but it was not carefully described
until after the group arrived in <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>. Several <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> birds representing
new genera (depending on the taxonomy source chosen) were described for
the first time, including the greater sage-grouse, common poorwill, McCown's
longspur, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> namesake species, the Lewis's woodpecker. The woodpecker,
whose previously unique genus <span class="italic">Asyndesmus</span> has recently been merged
with <span class="italic">Melanerpes</span>, was first seen along the edge of the <span class="tei_name">Big Belt Mountains</span> near
present-day <span class="tei_name">Helena</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. However, this woodland-edge woodpecker was
not actually collected until the following spring, near <span class="tei_name">Kamiah</span>, <span class="tei_name">Idaho</span>. A skin
of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> woodpecker is in Harvard University's Museum of Comparative
Zoology and is perhaps the only remaining intact museum specimen of all the
animals collected during the expedition. The least tern was also carefully described
and measured, based on two specimens they had shot. There can be no
doubt that these five species of birds, at minimum, were discovered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>
and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>.</p>
            <p>In his valuable summary of the natural history of the entire expedition,
Paul R. Cutright listed a total of 30 then-undescribed vertebrate species or subspecies
that were noted by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> during the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> phase and
possibly as many as 9 additional ones that were encountered but not adequately
described to identify them with certainty. Virginia Holmgren more recently
summarized the bird discoveries of the entire expedition, listing 25 that she believed
were sufficiently well described to warrant "discovery" status, 9 species
that might have been considered as newly discovered if they had been better
described, and 11 species that were already well known by some common
name but had not yet been formally described and named scientifically. In the
category of definitely discovered <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> birds, she listed the trumpeter
swan, greater sage-grouse, semipalmated plover, mountain plover, upland sandpiper,
long-billed curlew, least tern, common poorwill, Lewis's woodpecker,
Sprague's pipit, McCown's longspur, western meadowlark, and Brewer's blackbird.
Of these, the mountain plover and upland sandpiper are distinctly questionable
as to their identification. There is no evidence that the highly elusive
Sprague's pipit (<span class="italic">Anthus spragueii</span>) was ever seen, and the "small Kildee" observed
along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> was probably the piping plover rather than
the migratory and arctic-breeding semipalmated plover (<span class="italic">Charadrius semipalmatus</span>).
The identities of several <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> shorebirds mentioned briefly by
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, such as the mountain plover and long-billed curlew, are especially
problematic, as they used terms like "plover" and "curlew" rather indiscriminately
for shorebirds generally. The tundra swan (<span class="italic">Cygnus columbianus</span>)
(previously known as the whistling swan) was initially described from observations
made by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> during the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>-slope phase of their expedition,
but it or the trumpeter swan was seen earlier in what is now <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>.
The trumpeter swan is the semiresidential breeding swan of the northern plains,
whereas the arctic-breeding tundra swan is a spring and fall migrant only. Thus,
the chances of their having seen the trumpeter swan on the northern plains
were fairly good. At least eight previously unknown species—the trumpeter
swan, greater sage-grouse, piping plover, least tern, common poorwill, Lewis's
woodpecker, McCown's longspur, and western meadowlark—are well enough
documented to count as having certainly been seen by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and
the greater sage-grouse, least tern, and Lewis's woodpecker were as carefully
described as any practicing ornithologist of the day might have done. </p>
            <p>Among reptiles and fishes, the western rattlesnake, western hognose snake,
cutthroat trout, blue catfish, channel catfish, goldeye, and mountain sucker are
certain or likely to have been newly discovered species. Several <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>
mammal and reptile species that were known but only poorly documented,
such as the bison, gray wolf, coyote, western garter snake, and bullsnake, were
described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to a much greater degree than previously known.
Many other plains animals that later were determined to represent new subspecies
of previously known species were described, or at least mentioned, for
the first time.</p>
            <p>For the trip collectively, nearly 100 previously unknown species or subspecies
of vertebrate animals were encountered and variously described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, judging from a recent summary by the Sierra Club. About 40 percent of
these now have a state- or federal-level designation indicating that active protection
or conservation concern is warranted. Of these, 13 species are now classified as nationally endangered, including such classic <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> animals as the
gray (prairie) wolf, whooping crane, and the interior race of the least tern. <span class="tei_name">Great
Plains</span> species that were seen by the expedition members but are now federally
threatened include the piping plover and grizzly bear. In the past two centuries
the grizzly bear has changed from being the commonest large carnivore of the
upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley to having been completely eradicated from it. Similar
comments might be made of the gray wolf and the whooping crane.</p>
            <p>Cutright listed a total of 22 new plant species collected by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
during their journey upstream between the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Kansas River</span> and the
vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. They include such plants as Indian tobacco
(a species not native to the northern <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>), curly-top gumweed, and
three species of sagebrush. A surprising number of the plants they collected were
species believed by Native Americans to possess medicinal or other functional
properties, and thus were very familiar to and highly valued by the tribes of the
upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley. Most of them are now considered only to be weeds, and
none is listed as threatened or endangered.</p>
            <p>The expedition's return trip across the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> in 1806 was entirely
downstream and consequently much faster, thus accounting for the expedition's
far fewer zoological or botanical discoveries. However, at least five <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>
plants collected during the return trip were later described as new species, according
to Cutright. These included salt sage, red false mallow, gumbo evening
primrose, black greasewood, and snow-on-the-mountain. These discoveries
primarily consisted of plants obtained by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> while exploring the
upper <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> valley of northwestern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. Although no new plants
were obtained, several new topographic features and some significant wildlife
observations were documented by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> on his separate route down
the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>.</p>
            <p>Frederick Pursh initially examined 155 of the roughly 200 plant specimens
that successfully made their way back to the safety of the American Philosophical
Society collections in <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span>. At the time he published his studies
(1814), he classified four of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> specimens as representing new
genera and 123 as new species. A recent summary by James Reveal, Gary Moulton,
and Alfred Schuyler indicate that Pursh associated the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> materials
with 132 botanical names, 94 of which were newly proposed by him and
nearly all of which were taxonomically valid. These authors also determined
that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> collected at least 202 different kinds of plants. However,
many of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> specimens have since been lost. If all the plants encountered
and variously described but not necessarily preserved by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Clark</span> during their entire expedition are tallied, 176 previously unknown species
or subspecies can be listed, judging from a recent summary by the Sierra Club.
At least 17 new plant species were discovered while the explorers were in the
<span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> region. Gary Moulton has summarized the specimen and archival
data from all the herbarium sheets currently known to exist in volume 12 of
his definitive 13-volume <span class="italic">Journals of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition</span>. Names of
the plants mentioned here follow this reference, sometimes with parenthetical
synonyms of Latin or English vernacular names that have appeared in relevant
literature, such as the books of Paul Cutright and Raymond Burroughs. The
plants and animal species described in the text are arranged in alphabetic sequence
using English names, and both the Latin and English names are those
currently recognized as official. Alternate names given in quotes, including a
few place names, are those used by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and their often innovative
spelling has in such cases been retained.</p>
            <p>In the course of the expedition the group lived off the land, killing and eating
almost anything they could. Burroughs compiled a list of game killed in
the course of the expedition, largely for human consumption. At minimum, it
included 1,001 deer, 35 elk, 227 bison, 62 pronghorns, 113 beaver, 104 geese and
brant, 48 shorebirds ("plovers"), 46 grouse, 45 ducks and coots, and 9 turkeys.
They also killed 43 grizzly bears, 23 black bears, 18 wolves, and 16 otters. This
level of resource exploitation marked the beginning of a century of unrestrained
wildlife slaughter in America, ending in the elimination of the bison, elk, gray
wolf, and grizzly bear from the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>, and the complete extinction of the
passenger pigeon, Carolina parakeet, and Eskimo curlew.</p>
            <p>Exactly a century after the beginning of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition
(1903), President Theodore Roosevelt established in Florida the first of our national
wildlife refuges, and the long road toward the preservation and restoration
of our wildlife resources was at last under way. There are now more than 530
national wildlife refuges in the United States, of which the Charles M. Russell
National Wildlife Refuge in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> is much the largest of those situated along
the Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> route. There are 20 national grasslands, totaling 4 million
acres, 17 of which are in the western <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> from <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> and <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>
to <span class="tei_name">New Mexico</span> and <span class="tei_name">Texas</span>. There are now also 155 national forests, covering
almost 200 million acres, including the Lewis and Clark National Forest, located
between the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> Rivers of <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. Also, there are 300
Indian reservations, now still home to members of about 500 tribes; ten of these
reservations occur along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> between <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> and <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>,
some of them supporting direct descendants of the people first encountered by
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>.</p>
