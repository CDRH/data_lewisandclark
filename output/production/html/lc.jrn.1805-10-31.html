A Cloudy rainey disagreeable morning    I proceeded down the river to view with more attention [<span class="italic">NB: the rapids</span>] we had to pass on the river below, the two men with me <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">Jo. Fields</a> &amp; <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Peter Crusat</a> proceeded down to examine the rapids    the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29">Great Shute</a> which commenced at the Island on which we encamped Continud with great rapidity and force thro a narrow chanel much compressd. and interspersed with large rocks for ½ a mile, at a mile lower is a verry Considerable rapid at which place the waves are remarkably high, and proceeded on in a old Indian parth 2½ miles by land thro a thick wood &amp; hill Side, to the river where the Indians make a portage, from this place I dispatched <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Peter Crusat</a> (our principal waterman) back to follow the river and examine the practibility of the Canoes passing, as the rapids appeared to continue down below as far as I could See, I with <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">Jo. Fields</a> proceeded on, at ½ a mile below the end of the portage passed a house where there had been an old town for ages past as this house was old Decayed and a plac of flees I did not enter it, about ½ a mile below this house in a verry thick part of the woods is 8 vaults which appeared Closely Covered and highly deckerated with orniments. Those vaults are all nearly the Same Sise and form 8 feet Square, 5 feet high, Slopes a little So as to convey off the rain made of Pine or Cedar boards Closely Connected &amp; Scurely Covered with wide boards, with a Dore left in The East Side which is partially Stoped with wide boards curiously engraved. In Several of those vaults the dead bodies wre raped up verry Securely in Skins tied around with cords of grass &amp; bark, laid on a mat, all east &amp; west and Some of those vaults had as maney as 4 bodies laying on he Side of each other.    the other Vaults Containing bones only, Some contained bones for the debth of 4 feet.    on the tops and on poles attached to those vaults hung Brass kittles &amp; frying pans pearced thro their bottoms, baskets, bowls of wood, Sea Shels, Skins, bits of Cloth, Hair, bags of Trinkets &amp; Small peices of bone &amp;c and independant of the [<span class="italic">NB: Hieroglyphics, figures of men &amp; animals</span>] curious ingraveing and Paintings    on the boards which formed the vaults I observed Several wooden Images, cut in the figure of men and Set up on the 〈South〉 Sides of the vaults all round. Some of those So old and worn by time, that they were nearly out of Shape, I also observed the remains of Vaults rotted entirely into the ground and covered with moss. This must bee the burrying place for maney ages for the inhabitants of those rapids, the vaults are of the most lasting timber Pine &amp; Cedar—    I cannot Say certainly that those nativs worship those wooden idols as I have every reason to believe they do not; as they are Set up in the most conspicious parts of their houses, and treated more like orniments than objects of aderation.    at 2 miles lower &amp; 5 below our Camp I passed a village of 4 large houses abandend by the nativs, with their dores bared up, I looked into those houses and observed as much property as is usial in the houses of those people which induced me to conclude that they wre at no great distance, either hunting or Colecting roots, to add to their winter Subsistance.    from a Short distance below the vaults the mountain which is but low on the Stard.

Side for a great Distance down, the mountains high and rugid on the Lard Side    this open bottom is about 2 miles    a Short distance below this village is a bad Stoney rapid and appears to be the last in view    I observed at this lower rapid the remains of a large and antient Village which I could plainly trace by the Sinks in which they had formed their houses, as also those in which they had buried their fish—    from this rapid to the lower end of the portage the river is Crouded with rocks of various Sizes between which the water passes with great velociety createing in many places large Waves, an Island which is Situated near the Lard.
