As the Indians who were on their way down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> had a number of spare hoses with them I thought it probable that I could obtain some of them and therefore desired the Cheif to speak to them and inform me whether they would trade.    they gave no positive answer but requested to see the goods which I was willing to give in exchange. I now produced some battle axes which I had made at <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> with which they were much pleased.    knives also seemed a great demand among them. I soon purchased three horses and a mule.    for each horse I gave an ax a knife handkercheif and a little paint; &amp; for the mule the addition of a knife a shirt handkercheif and a pair of legings; at this price which was quite double that given for the horses, the fellow who sold him made a merit of having bestoed me one of his mules. I consider this mule a great acquisition. These Indians soon told me that they had no more horses for sale and I directed the party to prepare to set out. I had now nine horses and a mule, and two which I had hired made twelve these I had loaded and the Indian women took the ballance of the baggage. I had given the Interpreter some articles with which to purchase a horse for the woman which he had obtained.    at twelve Oclock we set out and passed the river below the forks, directing our rout towards the cove along the track formerly mentioned. <a href="#n21082401" id="ln21082401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    most of the horses were heavily laden, and it appears to me that it will require at least 25 horses to convey our baggage along such roads as I expect we shall be obliged to pass in the mountains. I had now the inexpressible satisfaction to find myself once more under way with all my baggage and party.    an Indian had the politeness to offer me one of his horses to ride which I accepted with cheerfullness as it enabled me to attend better to the march of the party. I had reached the lower part of the cove when an Indian rode up and informed me that one of my men was very sick and unable to come on. I directed the party to halt at a small run which falls into the creek on Lard. at the lower part of the Cove and rode back about 2 Miles where I found <a class="regularization" title="Weiser, Peter" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Weiser%2C%20Peter">Wiser</a> very ill with a fit of the cholic.

The few guns which the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshones</a> have are reserved for war almost exclusively and the bow and arrows are used in hunting. I have seen a few skins among these people which have almost every appearance of the common sheep.    they inform me that they finde this animal <a href="#n21082405" id="ln21082405" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> on the high mountains to the West and S. W. of them.    it is about the size of the common sheep, the wool is reather shorter and more intermixed with long hairs particularly on the upper part of the neck.    these skins have been so much woarn that I could not form a just Idea of the animal or it's colour.    the Indians however inform me that it is white and that it's horns are lunated comprest twisted and bent backward as those of the common sheep.    the texture of the skin appears to be that of the sheep. I am now perfectly convinced that the sheep as well as the Bighorn exist in these mountains.

The usual caparison of the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshone</a> horse is a halter and sadle.    the 1st consists either of a round plated or twisted cord of six or seven strands of buffaloe's hair, or a throng of raw hide made pliant by pounding and rubing.    these cords of bufaloe's hair are about the size of a man's finger and remarkably strong.    this is the kind of halter which is prefered by them.    the halter of whatever it may be composed is always of great length and is never taken from the neck of the horse which they commonly use at any time.    it is first attatched at one end about the neck of the horse with a knot that will not slip, it is then brought down to his under jaw and being passed through the mouth imbaces the under jaw and tonge in a simple noose formed by crossing the rope inderneath the jaw of the horse.    this when mounted he draws up on the near side of the horse's neck and holds in the left hand, suffering it to trail at a great distance behind him sometimes the halter is attatched so far from the end that while the shorter end serves him to govern his horse, the other trails on the grond as before mentioned.    they put their horses to their full speed with those cords trailing on the ground.    when they turn out the horse to graze the noose is mearly loosed from his mouth.    the saddle is made of wood and covered with raw hide which holds the parts very firmly together.    it is made like the pack saddles in uce among the French and Spaniards.    it consists of two flat thin boards which fit the sides of the horses back, and are held frirm by two peices which are united to them behind and before on the outer side and which rise to a considerable hight terminating sometimes in flat horizontal points extending outwards, and alwas in an accute angle or short bend underneath the upper part of these peices.    a peice of buffaloe's skin with the hair on, is usually put underneath the saddle; and very seldom any covering on the saddle [<em class="hi">NB: but when they ride they throw on a piece of Skin</em>].    stirrups when used are made of wood and covered with leather.    these are generally used by the elderly men and women; the young men scarcely ever use anything more than a small pad of dressed leather stuffed with hair, which is confined with a leather thong passing arond the body of the horse in the manner of a girth.    they frequently paint their favorite horses, and cut their ears in various shapes.    they also decorate their mains and tails, which they never draw or trim, with the feathers of birds, and sometimes suspend at the breast of the horse the finest ornaments they possess.    the Spanish bridle is prefered by them when they can obtain them, but they never dispence with the cord about the neck of the horse, which serves them to take him with more ease when he is runing at large. They are excellent horsemen and extreemly expert in casting the cord about the neck of a horse. [<em class="hi">NB: Make a noose &amp; catch him running &amp;c</em>] the horses that have been habituated to be taken with the cord in this way, however wild they may appear at first, surrender the moment they feel the cord about their necks.—    There are no horses in this quarter which can with propriety be termed wild.    there are some few which have been left by the indians at large for so great a length of time that they have become shye, but they all shew marks of having been in possession of man.    such is that one which <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.
