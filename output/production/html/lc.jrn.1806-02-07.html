The Seven or nine bark as it is called in the U, States is also Common in this quarter.

               <p>
The <span class="italic">Small Pox</span> had distroyed a great number of the nativs in this quarter. it provailed about 4 or 5 yrs Sinc among the <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsops</a>, and distroy'd Several hundreds of them, four of their Chiefs fell a victym to it's ravages. these <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsops</a> are Deposited in their Canoes on the bay a fiew miles below us.
