                  <span class="italic">Monday 23rd.</span>    The morning was warm and pleasant. We stayed here some time to procure provisions from the natives, for which we gave them in exchange a number of small articles. The provisions which we got consisted of roots, bread and fish.— Their bread is made of roots which they call comas, and which resemble onions in shape, but are of a sweet taste. This bread is manufactured by steaming, pounding and baking the roots on a kiln they have for the purpose. About 4 o'clock we renewed our journey, and went 2 miles to another small village, through a beautiful rich plain, in which these roots grow in abundance. We halted at the second village all night <a href="#n22092303" id="ln22092303" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and got some more provisions. About dark a shower of rain fell.

               <p>
Monday Septemr 23rd    This morning we had clear pleasant weather.    Our officers purchased from the Natives a quantity of Salmon &amp; root or potatoe bread, for which they gave them some small articles of Merchandise.    The Natives informed us, that they were at present engaged in a Warr, with a Nation of Indians who lived to the West of them, and that most of their Warriors were gone out to fight that Nation; The Indian women at this Village, are mostly employed in laying in Provisions for the Winter, and they informed us, that they intend going across the Mountains in the next Spring, 
over to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Mesouri River</a>; in Order to hunt buffalo.    We found among the Natives which are with us, Copper kettles, Beads &amp; a few knives; which they informed us they got from the Traders, living to the Westwards of their Village, and which we suppose came from the Western Ocean.    They appeared to be very fond of our Merchandise, &amp; in particular of some large Blue beads, which our officers had.    They were likewise fond of Red Cloth.    They gave our Officers for a Small piece of that article as broad as ones hand, double the quantity of Salmon &amp; bread, that they would for any article of the same Value, (excepting the large blue beads) however as Merchandise of all sorts are scarce among them, they appeared to be fond of every article that we had of Merchandise among us.    Our officers gave the Chiefs of this Village a Flag; they also gave a Flag to a Chief who resided at a Village 2 Miles from this Village on our Road.—    They hoisted the flag at the Chiefs lodge, &amp; seemed very much pleased at the present their Chiefs had received.—    These Indians live very well.    They dress themselves with Mountain sheep, (Ibex) deer &amp; Elk skins, which they dress &amp; make very pliable.    They have Buffalo Robes among them, but don't wish to part with any of them.—</p>
               <p>
These Indians behaved very friendly to us, &amp; gave both our officers &amp; men many small presents.—    In the afternoon we hunted up our horses, &amp; found them all but two, &amp; loaded them.    We left one of our Men behind, in order to hunt for the horses which was lost.    We proceeded on to another Indian Village, which lay on the same Creek, &amp; about 2 Miles distant, and Encamped.    Our officers here purchased from the Indians belonging to this Village, Some Salmon &amp; skins of various kinds which were dressed.    In the Evening we had a Shower of Rain attended with thunder.    The Indians at this Village, live in the same manner as those at the other Village which we left this day, &amp; have Salmon &amp; root bread in great plenty.—    The Indians at this Village are far more numerous than those at the first Village that we came to, after crossing the Mountains.    They talk very loud, &amp; their language seems confused.    This Village is built more compact than the last Village that we left; several of their lodges join each other, the most of which, are made out of dressed leather.    they have also lodges made out of Flags &amp; are preparing to build several others of the same kind.
