            <p>
On June 10, 1806, the Corps of Discovery left <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a> on the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater River</a> and moved up to higher ground on <a class="regularization" title="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Weippe%20Prairie%20%28Camas%20Flats%2C%20Quawmash%20Flats%29">Weippe Prairie</a>. They had waited over a month for the snow to melt in the <a class="regularization" title="Bitterroot (Snow) Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Bitterroot%20%28Snow%29%20Mountains">Bitterroot Mountains</a> so that they could proceed eastward on the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a>. They set out on the trail on June 15, but soon realized that they could not find their way in the deep snow. On June 17, after caching many of their goods in trees, they turned back. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> lamented, "this is the first time since we have been on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or make a retrograde march." To add discomfort to discouragement he also reported, "it rained on us most of this evening."</p>
            <p>
They returned to <a class="regularization" title="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Weippe%20Prairie%20%28Camas%20Flats%2C%20Quawmash%20Flats%29">Weippe Prairie</a> and sent to the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> camps to hire guides. Three young men offered to serve for the price of two guns. On June 24 the party set out again. The Indians found the trail easily and the party made their way to their old camp at <a class="regularization" title="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20%28Travelers%27%20Rest%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29">Travelers' Rest</a>, near present <a class="regularization" title="Missoula, Mont." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missoula%2C%20Mont.">Missoula</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a>, taking only six days in contrast to the eleven days of the westbound trip. They spent a few days resting for the next stage of the journey. At <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a> the captains had decided to divide the party for an extended time to investigate previously unexplored territory. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> would head east across the mountains to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls of the Missouri</a>, then explore the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias River</a> before returning to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>. His purpose was to discover if the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias</a> drained northern reaches thus giving further territorial claims to the United States under the Louisiana Purchase. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> would go southeast to the site of <a class="regularization" title="Camp Fortunate (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Fortunate%20%28Mont.%29">Camp Fortunate</a>, then down the <a class="regularization" title="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River">Beaverhead</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Jefferson%20River%20%28North%2C%20Southwest%20Fork%29">Jefferson</a> rivers to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">Three Forks of the Missouri</a>. Part of his party would then take canoes down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a> to meet <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> party there, while <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> went east to the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> and down that river. His object was to inspect the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> and perhaps make contact with additional Indian tribes. The two captains and their men would meet at the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>.</p>
            <p>
On July 3 the two groups went their separate ways, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> admitting "I could not avoid feeling much concern on this occasion although I hoped this separation was only momentary." It was the first time during the expedition that they had separated for so great a distance and time. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> headed down the <a class="regularization" title="Bitterroot (Clark's, Flathead) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Bitterroot%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%29%20River">Bitterroot River</a>, then up the <a class="regularization" title="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clark%20Fork%20%28Clark%27s%2C%20East%20Fork%20Clark%27s%2C%20Flathead%29%20River">Clark Fork</a> and across the <a class="regularization" title="Continental Divide" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a> along a route suggested by the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Shoshones</a> and other Indians. By July 13 he and his nine men were at the <a class="regularization" title="Upper portage camp (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Upper%20portage%20camp%20%28Mont.%29">Upper Portage Camp</a> above the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a>, delighted after months of poor rations to be back in buffalo country. When <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> men dug up the cache at the camp they encountered problems with the host of grizzly bears in the vicinity. <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">Hugh McNeal</a> had a very close call with one beast in which he broke his musket over its head.</p>
            <p>
Several of their horses disappeared, probably stolen by Indians, so <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> decided to take only his three best menâ€”<a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">George Drouillard</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph and Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph%20and%20Reubin">Reubin and Joseph Field</a>â€”on his exploration of the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Sergeant Patrick Gass</a> and the others remained at the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a> to await the canoe party from the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">Three Forks</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and his companions set out on horseback on July 14, heading north to the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias</a> and then upriver to the stream's upper forks. On <a class="regularization" title="Cut Bank Creek (North Branch of Marias River)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Cut%20Bank%20Creek%20%28North%20Branch%20of%20Marias%20River%29">Cut Bank Creek</a>, near the mountains, they camped from July 20 to 26, waiting for the clouds to clear so <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> could take astronomical observations; <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was disappointed to discover the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias</a> did not extend so far north as he had hoped. On July 26 he gave up and set off for the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias</a>, leaving what he named <a class="regularization" title="Camp Disappointment (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Disappointment%20%28Mont.%29">Camp Disappointment</a>.</p>
            <p>
That afternoon they met eight Indians who proved to be <a class="regularization" title="Blackfeet Indians, Piegan" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Blackfeet%20Indians%2C%20Piegan">Piegan Blackfeet</a>, a tribe <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and his small party had wanted to avoid. They talked and all agreed to camp together that night on <a class="regularization" title="Two Medicine River (Main or South Branch Marias River)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Two%20Medicine%20River%20%28Main%20or%20South%20Branch%20Marias%20River%29">Two Medicine River</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was awakened the next morning by sounds of a struggle as the Indians tried to make off with the expedition's guns and horses. <a class="regularization" title="Field, Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Reubin">Reubin Field</a> stabbed one of the Indians to the heart, then the party pursued the others who were fleeing with the horses. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was forced to shoot one of the <a class="regularization" title="Blackfeet Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Blackfeet%20Indians">Blackfeet</a> in self-defense. It was the first and only instance of actual armed violence between the explorers and Indians in the whole expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drouillard</a>, and the <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph and Reubin" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph%20and%20Reubin">Fields</a> fled southeasterly as fast as they could. On July 28, near the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias River</a>, they met the six men from the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a>, along with <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Sergeant John Ordway</a> and nine others whom <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had sent down from the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">Three Forks</a>. They moved quickly on to the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Marias</a> and retrieved cached goods and the white pirogue there. Then <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and his united group were able to travel down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> with relative ease and speed.</p>
            <p>
At the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>, which they reached on August 7, the remains of a note indicated that <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had gone on down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> followed, taking time to hunt for food. On August 11 he was hunting on the banks of the river with <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</a> when the Frenchman, thinking the captain was an elk, accidentally shot him in the thigh. The journey continued with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> in considerable pain, and on August 12, below the <a class="regularization" title="Little Knife River (Goat Pen Creek)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Little%20Knife%20River%20%28Goat%20Pen%20Creek%29">Little Knife River</a> in <a class="regularization" title="North Dakota" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>, the two captains and their parties were reunited.</p>
            <p>
               <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> party had had their difficulties, but their trip had been idyllic compared with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a>. Like <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had left <a class="regularization" title="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20%28Travelers%27%20Rest%29%20Creek%20%28Mont.%29">Travelers' Rest</a> on July 3, moving southeast over some new terrain across the mountains to their old <a class="regularization" title="Camp Fortunate (Mont.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Fortunate%20%28Mont.%29">Camp Fortunate</a> at the forks of the <a class="regularization" title="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Beaverhead%20%28Jefferson%29%20River">Beaverhead River</a>. There the party recovered cached goods and canoes and traveled down to the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River, Three Forks of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River%2C%20Three%20Forks%20of%20the">Three Forks</a> by both canoe and horseback, arriving on July 13. From the forks <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> dispatched <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a> with the canoes down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> to the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">Great Falls</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> himself with twelve persons, including <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, and their child, headed for the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a>, which they reached on July 15.</p>
            <p>
They continued down the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> on horseback, but on July 18 <a class="regularization" title="Gibson, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gibson%2C%20George">George Gibson</a> was injured and could not ride after his horse threw him, so <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> decided to make canoes and continue by water. On the twenty-fourth he set out again, sending <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</a> with three men and the horses to travel overland to the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages. <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> was to make contact with trader <a class="regularization" title="Heney, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Heney%2C%20Hugh">Hugh Heney</a>, going north into <a class="regularization" title="Canada" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Canada">Canada</a> if necessary, to secure <a class="regularization" title="Heney, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Heney%2C%20Hugh">Heney's</a> services as an intermediary with the <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians">Sioux</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor's</a> mission ended prematurely on the second night out when Indians, probably <a class="regularization" title="Crow Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Crow%20Indians">Crows</a>, stole his party's horses. He and his men made <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a>-style "bull boats" of buffalo hides and floated down the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> and the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> pursuing <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, whom they overtook on August 8.</p>

He passed the landmark he named "<a class="regularization" title="Pompeys Pillar (Pompy's Tower)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pompeys%20Pillar%20%28Pompy%27s%20Tower%29">Pompy's Tower</a>"â€”after little <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</a>â€”on July 25, near present <a class="regularization" title="Billings, Mont." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Billings%2C%20Mont.">Billings</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Montana" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Montana">Montana</a>, and proceeded on, arriving at the mouth of the river on August 3. The original plan was for him to wait there for <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, but the mosquitoes were terrible and game was scarce so he left a note for <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and continued down the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>. On August 11 <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> party met two trappers, <a class="regularization" title="Dickson, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Dickson%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Dickson</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Hancock, Forrest" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hancock%2C%20Forrest">Forrest Hancock</a>, the first whites they had seen since April 1805. These men could provide little information from the East, since they had been absent since the summer of 1804. They did, however, inform <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> that the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> tribes were fighting one another again. The captain realized that his and <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> successes at peacemaking had been limited and of short duration. The next day the wounded <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and his contingent caught up with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>.</p>
            <p>
The discomfort of his wound now caused <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> to give up his journalizing, leaving <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> to continue the record to the end of the trip. Characteristically, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> last entry included the description of one last plant, the pin cherry. The Corps returned to the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages on August 14. They remained there only three days, trying to persuade <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Hidatsa Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Hidatsa%20Indians">Hidatsa</a> chiefs to go with them to see the president, but only <a class="regularization" title="Big White (Sheheke)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Big%20White%20%28Sheheke%29">Sheheke</a>, the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a>, and his family consented. <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Charbonneau</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Jean%20Baptiste">Jean Baptiste</a> remained behind, and <a class="regularization" title="Colter, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Colter%2C%20John">John Colter</a> received a discharge so he could return to the mountains on a trapping venture with <a class="regularization" title="Dickson, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Dickson%2C%20Joseph">Dickson</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Hancock, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hancock%2C%20George">Hancock</a>.</p>

As they headed downriver on August 17 their thoughts were all directed toward home. They stopped overnight on the twenty-first at the <a class="regularization" title="Arikara Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Arikara%20Indians">Arikara</a> villages, where they found the Indians unhappy because a chief sent to <a class="regularization" title="Washington D.C." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington%20D.C.">Washington</a> the previous year had not returned. No other chiefs would agree to go. On August 30 they gave some <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians, Teton" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians%2C%20Teton">Teton Sioux</a> the cold shoulder because of the troubles they had had with this tribe in 1804. They met with the <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians, Yankton" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians%2C%20Yankton">Yankton</a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Sioux Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Sioux%20Indians">Sioux</a> near the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Niobrara (Quicurre, Rapid) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Niobrara%20%28Quicurre%2C%20Rapid%29%20River">Niobrara</a> on September 1, and held a friendly council. On September 4 they revisited <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd's</a> grave near the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Big Sioux River (RiviÃ¨re des Sioux)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Big%20Sioux%20River%20%28Rivi%C3%A8re%20des%20Sioux%29">Big Sioux River</a>.</p>

They were now meeting trading parties bound upriver, who gave them the news of over two years, including the fact that most people in the United States had given them up for lost, although "the President of the U. States had yet hopes of us." <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was recovering from his wound as they daily passed camp-sites and other familiar scenes of the toilsome upriver trip. In the last days of the journey the men were troubled by sore eyes, but they pushed on, eager to reach <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>. On September 20, near <a class="regularization" title="La Charette, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=La%20Charette%2C%20Mo.">La Charette</a>, they saw cows for the first time since leaving the settlements. Soon the inhabitants of the little settlement greeted them enthusiastically. The next day they reached <a class="regularization" title="Saint Charles, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Charles%2C%20Mo.">St. Charles</a>, meeting old friends, and on the twenty-second they saw a significant omen of change, the first American fort west of the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> at <a class="regularization" title="Belle Fontaine, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Belle%20Fontaine%2C%20Mo.">Belle Fontaine</a> a few miles above the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>.</p>
            <p>
Emerging from the river's mouth on September 23, they briefly visited the camp at <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">Wood River</a> that they had left some twenty-eight months before, then sailed on and reached <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> at noon. The citizens, having received advance word, lined the riverfront and cheered. Two days later, at <a class="regularization" title="Christy's Tavern" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Christy%27s%20Tavern">Christy's Tavern</a>, they were treated to a lavish dinner, with eighteen toasts, ending with "Captains <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>â€”Their perilous services endear them to every American heart." The next day <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> brought his journals to an end with a brief, anticlimactic entry: "a fine morning Â Â  we commenced wrighting &amp;c."
