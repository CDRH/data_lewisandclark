Last evening <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> visited his traps and caught a beaver and an otter; the beaver was large and fat we have therefore fared sumptuously today; this we consider a great prize for another reason, it being a full grown beaver was well supplyed with the materials for making bate with which to catch others.    this bate when properly prepared will intice the beaver to visit it as far as he can smell it, and this I think may be safely stated at a mile, their sense of smelling being very accute. To prepare beaver bate, the castor <a href="#n27010701" id="ln27010701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> or bark stone is taken as the base, this is gently pressed out of the bladderlike bag which contains it, into aphiol of 4 ounces with a wide mouth; if you have them you will put from four to six stone in a phiol of that capacity, to this you will add half a nutmet, a douzen or 15 grains of cloves and thirty grains of cinimon finely pulverized, stir them well together and then add as much ardent sperits to the composition as will reduce it the consistency mustard prepared for the table; when thus prepared it resembles mustard precisely to all appearance. when you cannot procure a phiol a bottle made of horn or a tight earthen vessel will answer, in all cases it must be excluded from the air or it will soon loose it's virtue; it is fit for uce immediately it is prepared but becomes much stronger and better in about four or five days and will keep for months provided it be perfectly secluded from the air.    when cloves are not to be had use double the quantity of Allspice, and when no spice can be obtained use the bark of the root of sausafras; when sperits can not be had use oil stone of the beaver adding mearly a sufficient quantity to moisten the other materials, or reduce it to a stif past.    it appears to me that the principal uce of the spices is only to give a variety to the scent of the bark stone and if so the mace <a href="#n27010702" id="ln27010702" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> vineller <a href="#n27010703" id="ln27010703" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and other sweetsmelling spices might be employed with equal advantage. The male beaver has six stones, two which contain a substance much like finely pulvarized bark of a pale yellow colour and not unlike tanner's ooz in smell, these are called the <em class="hi">bark stones</em> or castors; two others, which like the bark stone resemble small bladders, contain a pure oil of a strong rank disagreeable smell, and not unlike <em class="hi">train oil,</em>
                   <a href="#n27010704" id="ln27010704" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> these are called the <em class="hi">oil stones;</em> and 2 others of generation.    the Barkstones are about two inc[h]es in length, the others somewhat smaller all are of a long oval form; and lye in a bunch together between the skin and the root of the tail, beneath or behind the fundament with which they are closely connected and seem to communicate. the pride <a href="#n27010705" id="ln27010705" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the female lyes on the inner side much like those of the hog. they have no further parts of generation that I can perceive and therefore beleive that like the birds they copulate with the extremity of the gut. The female have from two to four young ones at a birth and bring fourth once a year only, which usually happens about the latter end of may and begining of June.    at this stage she is said to drive the male from the lodge, who would otherwise destroy the young.—    dryed our lodge and had it put away under shelter; this is the first day during which we have had no rain since we arrived at this place.    nothing extraordinary happened today.—

Some frost this morning.    I[t] may appear Somewhat incrediable, but So it is that the Elk which was killed last evening was eaten except about 8 pounds, which I directed to be taken along with the Skin, I proceded up the <a class="regularization" title="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Gallatin%20%28South%2C%20Southeast%20Fork%29%20River">South fork</a> of the Creek about 2 miles and crossed on a pine tree which had been fallen by the Saltmakers on their first going out, on this tree we crossed the deepest of the water and waded on the opposit Side for 30 yards, from thence to the ocian ¾ of a mile through a Continuation of open ridgey Prarie, here the Coast is Sandy, we proceeded on the Sandy beech nearly South for 3 miles to the mouth of butifull river with bold and rapid Current of 85 yards wide and 3 feet deep in the Shallowest place, a Short distance up this river on the N E Side is the remains of an old village of <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsops</a>.
