            <p>The American people have always disliked the idea of a large regular army in peacetime. In the early days of the Republic, however, America began to discover that some kind of standing army was essential; militia was not always enough.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Revolution, the Congress began to divest itself of the army that had defeated Cornwallis at Yorktown. Despite some dissenting voices, soldiers who had enlisted to serve for the duration of the war were discharged. By January, 1784, <span class="tei_name">Major General Henry Knox</span>, the new commander, could report that only about 620 men were still in service—and the bottom figure was still to come. In June of that year, Congress discharged all but twenty-five men who were to be posted to Fort Pitt and West Point to protect materiel. No officer about the rank of captain was retained in service. <a href="#n01" id="ln01" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Almost at once, the thinking of Congress had to change. Indian hostilities in the old Northwest, and the refusal of <span class="tei_name">Great Britain</span> to vacate certain garrisons, necessitated new enlistments and the building of new forts on the frontier. When these threats were lessened somewhat by the signing of Jay's Treaty with <span class="tei_name">England</span> in 1794, and the Treaty of Greenville with the Indians in 1795, tensions were eased—and then another new threat appeared. Misunderstandings between the United States and <span class="tei_name">France</span>, eventually to result in the stand-off now called the Quasi-War, prompted Congress to authorize a provisional army of ten thousand men for a period not to exceed three years. <a href="#n02" id="ln02" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> When the excitement cooled without any land confrontation with <span class="tei_name">France</span>, that temporary quantum jump in the number of armed forces was reversed. In the final months of the <span class="tei_name">John Adams</span> administration, in 1800, the United States forces consisted mainly of four regiments of infantry, two of artillerists and engineers, and two of light dragons. <a href="#n03" id="ln03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> This was the army that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> took over as commander-in-chief, upon his assumption of office in 1801.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had run for the presidency on a platform calling for even greater reductions; the discharge of the provisional army was not enough to satisfy the Republican demand for a minimum standing army. When he took office, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> commanded an authorized force of 5,400 officers and men. By the end of his first year, he and the Congress were to eliminate the cavalry, cut back the number of artillerists and engineers, and thus pare the army enrollment to about one-half. <a href="#n04" id="ln04" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The new president did not know the military as well as he might have. He knew the army, but that was a different thing. The army was that great force in the government about which he could talk knowledgeably with generals and cabinet officers, discussing balance of power, regimental strength, deployment, and logistics. The military were the officers and men of that army, and <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had never been one of them; he had never worn a uniform.</p>
            <p>Reducing the number of enlisted men would be no problem, for actually the maintaining of regiments up to authorized strength had always been difficult. But reducing the officer corps requited a different approach. These career professionals must be dealt with as individuals, some to stay and some to go.</p>
            <p>By midsummer following his election, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had received from the War Department a roster or roll of all his commissioned officers, listed with their rank and the units they commanded or to which they were assigned. <a href="#n05" id="ln05" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>  Most certainly there were men on the roster who were longtime friends and associates of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>: <span class="tei_name">Brigadier General James Wilkinson</span>, the commanding general; <span class="tei_name">Major Thomas F. Cushing</span>, the adjutant and inspector; and such familiar names as <span class="tei_name">John F. Hamtramck</span>, commanding the First Infantry, and old <span class="tei_name">Major Zebulon Pike</span>, of the Third Infantry, the father of the famous explorer.</p>
            <p>But most of the officers on the roster were strangers to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, and he would need to rely upon someone else to tell him who the potential leaders were, as well as the incompetents, and to identify those officers as Republican or Federalist. That the Federalists would be in the majority he could have no doubt, for the party patronage had become an aspect of the military policy under the administration of <span class="tei_name">John Adams</span>.</p>
            <p>The measure that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> took to obtain a profile of the army is shown upon the roster, dated July 24, 1801. After each officer's name, one or more symbols appear. They are mysterious marks—circles, crosses, and combinations of dots—intended to be understood only by someone who possessed a key to the symbols. That key, written on a single sheet of paper, is present with the roster in the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> papers at the Library of Congress. On it the symbols are given such meanings as these: officers who are superior; those who are respectable but not superior; those unfit to serve; officers who are Republicans, or Federalists, and—the ultimate downgrading—those "most violently opposed to the Administration and still active in its vilification."</p>
            <p>These symbols, and the sheet explaining their meaning, have until recently been described as being "in an unknown hand." <a href="#n06" id="ln06" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>  They are, in fact, in the hand of a young man whose name is a familiar one today wherever American history is read. It is the hand of <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span>, of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition.</p>
            <p>While we cannot assume with certainty that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> made the evaluations, merely because the symbols are in his handwriting, a re-examination of his relationship with <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> renders this assumption quite tenable.</p>
            <p>Nothing in the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> story is more firmly believed than the tradition that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> hired <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> in 1801, not as a secretary or aide, but as a trainee for a transcontinental expedition. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was a hometown boy whom <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had known since childhood. He had received some conventional grammar-school education with classical overtones, and had absorbed a greater than average interest in natural history. Much of his knowledge was self-acquired. He seemed born to rise, in the agricultural-mercantile circles of <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>, and he chose one of the most routinely traveled routes: a career in the United States Army.</p>
            <p>Joining the militia during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> moved north and languished in various cantonments in western <span class="tei_name">Maryland</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span>, deciding the following year to try life in the regular army. He was appointed ensign in the second sub-legion in 1795, transferring the next year to the First Infantry Regiment. This was to be his outfit for the duration of his military career. His active duty was spent partly in the recruiting service and partly as a paymaster. As a special messenger for <span class="tei_name">General Anthony Wayne</span>, and as paymaster to his regiment, he traveled much. During a furlough he went to <span class="tei_name">Kentucky</span> on family business, and his duties took him from post to post in the <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span> Valley: <span class="tei_name">Fort Wayne</span>, <span class="tei_name">Detroit</span>, <span class="tei_name">Pittsburgh</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Cincinnati</span>.</p>
            <p>Soon after <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> learned the results of the election that made him president he wrote young <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and offered him a position as his secretary. Sending the request through channels, he told <span class="tei_name">General Wilkinson</span> that he thought it would be advantageous "to take one who possessing a knolege of Western country, of the army &amp; it's situation, might sometimes aid us with information of interest, which we may not otherwise possess." He used similar language in his letter to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> himself, saying "Your knolege of the Western country, of the army and of all it's interests &amp; relations has rendered it desirable for public as well as private purpose that you should be engaged in that office." <a href="#n07" id="ln07" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>At this point, historians go astray by stacking one conjecture upon another. They reason that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had long wished for an expedition to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>; that he was at last in a position to carry out such an operation; and that he placed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> on his staff so that he could personally guide the study and preparation necessary for such an expedition. Dozens of books and articles on the expedition contain these assumptions.</p>
            <p>To accept this easy train of events is to sidestep several matters about which we can never be entirely informed. It is true that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had since 1783 shown specific signs that he valued the idea of a transcontinental exploration. He had asked <span class="tei_name">George Rogers Clark</span> in that year how he would like to lead such an enterprise, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had declined. He had helped the American Philosophical Society to raise the money and draw the plans for botanist <span class="tei_name">André Michaux</span>, who proposed to visit the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> Coast but whose plans were canceled. In both these instances, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> apparently was acting as a private citizen. But during the seven years he served in the federal government, in the 1790s, he did nothing whatsoever to press for a government–sponsored expedition. His correspondence during the last half of the 1790s contains almost nothing about the American West.</p>
            <p>Perhaps what brought <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s thoughts back to hemispheric geography was the publication of a book in <span class="tei_name">London</span>. Late in 1801, <span class="tei_name">Alexander Mackenzie</span>'s <em class="hi">Voyages…Through the Continent of North American, to the Frozen and <span class="tei_name">Pacific Ocean</span>
               </em> was published; copies were available in <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="tei_name">New York</span> within a short time. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> already knew something of <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>'s travels, but his first knowledge of the book probably came in a letter from <span class="tei_name">Dr. Caspar Wistar</span>, of <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span>, who frequently sent the president bits of new information. In January, 1802, he wrote: "Have you seen <span class="tei_name">McKenzie</span>'s account of his journeys across the Continent &amp; to the Northern Ocean?" <a href="#n08" id="ln08" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>  He was referring, of course, to <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>'s expedition across <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>—during which he reached the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. At the end of the <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>'s narrative, he had urged the British government to lose no time in establishing a trading post in the Pacific Northwest, to gain control of the very profitable trade with the Orient in sea-otter skins. <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>'s suggestion with filled with implications for the control not only of the fur trade but of an enormously important part of the continent.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> ordered a copy of <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>'s book, probably receiving it in the summer of 1802. <a href="#n09" id="ln09" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> During August he had as a house guest his old <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> friend, and member of the American Philosophical Society, <span class="tei_name">Benjamin Smith Barton</span>. <span class="tei_name">Barton</span>'s travel diary for the period is missing or was not kept, so we have no record of his stay at <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span>. The two men might well have discussed the Far West, as <span class="tei_name">Barton</span> had been a participant in the earlier plan to send <span class="tei_name">Michaux</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. It is not likely, however, that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> mentioned a specific new western enterprise; we may suspect this because, when he finally informed <span class="tei_name">Barton</span> that he was sending <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>, some months later, he wrote in terms that suggest he was then advising his friend for the first time. <a href="#n10" id="ln10" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime within the weeks immediately following <span class="tei_name">Barton</span>'s visit, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> must have decided to act. By early December, 1802, he had approached the Spanish minister to United States, <span class="tei_name">Carlos Martinez de Irujo</span>, setting forth his plan to explore the course of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>, cross the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, and descend the western watercourses to the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span>. <a href="#n11" id="ln11" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>  It appears, then, that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s decision to set on foot what was to become the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Expedition was made about a year and a half after he had hired <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> as a member of his staff.</p>
            <p>In reviewing the wording of the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s first letter, offering <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> the post of secretary, perhaps we have been paying attention to the wrong phrase. The two key phrases in the message are: <em class="hi">Your knolege of the Western country</em> and <em class="hi">the army and of all it's interests &amp; relations</em>. By "western country" <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> meant the <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span> Valley. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had traveled there and knew what the westerners were thinking—a matter of deep concern to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, who must be alert to the separatist elements on the outer edge of his constituency. An intelligent young officer who had recently traveled as far as <span class="tei_name">Kentucky</span> could be useful especially if he were someone long known and trusted by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>.</p>
            <p>The phase mentioning "the army and all it's interests &amp; relations" may be the more important one. Here was a young military man who could be expected to escalate for <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, in complete candor, the officers of high and low rank whom he had come to know so well as he traveled his paymaster's route. If one can read into <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s knowledge of the "western country" the potential for a transcontinental expedition, it is equally logical to see in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s reference to "the army and all it's interests" an assignment to help him with the task of reshaping the military forces.</p>
            <p>Below is the list of qualifications which <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> set forth on his sheet of symbols, then transferred to the roster (see also fig. 1). For simplicity the symbols have been converted to letters of the alphabet, and the wording slightly altered. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> called the listing: "Explanation of the notes set opposite (in the column of remarks) to the names of the several officers composing the Army of the United States."</p>
            <p>[a] Denotes such officers as are of the 1st Class, so esteemed from a superiority of genius &amp; Military proficiency. 
[b] Officers of the second class, respectable as officers, but not altogether entitled to the 1st grade.
[c] The same. Republican.
[d] Officers whose political opinions are not positively ascertained.
[e] Political apathy.
[g] Opposed to the Administration more decisively.
[h] Most violently opposed to the administration and still active in the vilification.
[i] Professionally the soldier without any political creed. 
[j] Unworthy of the commissions they bear.
[k] Unknown to us. </p>

            </table></div>
            <p>Tables 1 and 2 present some data compiled from the roster of officers and the evaluations added by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. Table 1, showing distribution to officers by state, would have come as no surprise to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>; a large proportion of his officers came from the more heavily populated Federalist states in the Northeast. In Table 2, the data have been adapted and simplified; for example, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>'s three categories of Federalist, ranging from mild to unregenerate, have been combined under a single heading.</p>
            <p>It is clear that in the winnowing process, military qualifications were given greater consideration that party preference. There are however, two ways to state this conclusion. We can say that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and his advisers followed the practice of ignoring party preference, selecting the officers to be retained on the basis of military proficiency. It may be more realistic to phrase the conclusion in a different way: no matter how much <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> might have wished for an army heavily weighted with Republicans, there was no way that he could have it in the early years of his administration.</p>
            <p>In converting to a non-Federalist army, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had to pay attention first to his small general staff, all but one of whom had multiple crosses after their names to denote their category as "most violently opposed to the administration." Of the seven officers on the general staff, three were discharged within a year after their evaluation. Two old officers who had served honorably in the Revolution were retained, despite their Federalist leanings: <span class="tei_name">Thomas H. Cushing</span>, the adjutant and inspector, and <span class="tei_name">Caleb Swan</span>, the paymaster general. <span class="tei_name">Edward D. Turner</span>, brigade inspector, was retained as a captain but resigned three years later. In assigning political ranking to the men of the general staff, young <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> had a problem about the commanding general himself, <span class="tei_name">James Wilkinson</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> placed no symbols at all after <span class="tei_name">Wilkinson</span>'s name, perhaps because he felt it presumptuous to evaluate him, or because he felt that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> knew <span class="tei_name">Wilkinson</span>'s strengths and weaknesses all too well. <span class="tei_name">Wilkinson</span> son was retained as commanding general, and in later years, when he was implicated in the <span class="tei_name">Aaron Burr</span> conspiracy and other intrigues, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> defended him—though not without some equivocation.</p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> wanted Republicans in his top civilian posts, military and naval, as well as in the commissioned ranks. His appointment of <span class="tei_name">Henry Dearborn</span>, of <span class="tei_name">Maine</span>, to be secretary of war was a gesture to the strongly Federalist Northeast, as was his appointment of <span class="tei_name">Attorney General Levi Lincoln</span>, of <span class="tei_name">Massachusetts</span>. He offered the post of secretary of the navy to four Republicans before filling it with <span class="tei_name">Benjamin Stoddert</span>, who soon resigned to be replaced by <span class="tei_name">Robert Smith</span>. <a href="#n12" id="ln12" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The conversion of the army was no secret. In June, 1802, the attorney general warned <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> that much unrest was evident in the Northeast although he believed that federalism was losing ground. He wrote, "<span class="tei_name">General Dearborn</span> &amp; myself endeavored to prepare a list of names this morning, for commissions for <span class="tei_name">Massachusetts</span>, to submit to your consideration. As soon as we have done the best we can do, we will wait on you with it." <a href="#n13" id="ln13" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> When the secretary of the navy recommended that <span class="tei_name">Robert Gamble</span>, of <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span>, be appointed a midshipman, he was careful to remind the president that the young man was highly recommended by <span class="tei_name">John P. G. Muhlenberg</span>, and active Republican. And when <span class="tei_name">Alexander Dallas</span> came up for his midshipman's commission, his only character reference was his father, <span class="tei_name">Alexander J. Dallas</span>, another influential Republican who was secretary of the commonwealth of <span class="tei_name">Pennsylvania</span>. <a href="#n14" id="ln14" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>'s patronage policy was personally a moderate one, but he was subject to conflicting pressures. <span class="tei_name">Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin</span> favored a completely nonpartisan appointment policy in some areas of government. On the other hand, <span class="tei_name">Henry Dearborn</span> was unrelenting in his insistence on removing Federalists. He told <span class="tei_name">House speaker Joseph B. Varnum</span>: "We have been much more liberal towards them, that they would be towards us, and in future I think we ought to give them measure for measure." <a href="#n15" id="ln15" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>In remaking the regular army, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> was more successful in controlling its size than its political complexion. After Congress passed the act fixing the military peace establishment in 1802, there was no increase in the regular army for six years—until a conflict with England began to seem likely. <a href="#n16" id="ln16" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>To summarize, it seems probably that <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> hired <span class="tei_name">Captain Meriwether Lewis</span> for quite another purpose that to train him for a transcontinental expedition, and that he decided on that expedition much later than has been previously believed. And so when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> set out from <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> and <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span>, in the spring of 1803, to begin the nation's most enduring tale of exploration and adventure, he had the satisfaction of knowing that he already had served his president and his party in a rather unusual way.</p>
