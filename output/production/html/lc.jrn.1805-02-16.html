                  <em class="hi">Saturday 16th Feby. 1805</em>.    a clear cold morning    one of our men got
lame and turned back.    the Indians all returned also, we proceeded on about 6 mls. to where their was Some lodges where <a class="regularization" title="Gravelines, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gravelines%2C%20Joseph">Mr Gravelleens</a> men was Robed last fall by some of the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandanes</a>.    when we came in Site we Saw a Smoak which we expected that they were all their waiting for another oppertunity to Seel more horses or to attach us.    we then went up the bank of the river a considerable distance above the place in to the bushes.    left the horse, sled &amp; baggage even our blankets. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</a> Sent a Sergt. with a part of the men a little back from the River with orders to advance immediately after hearing the horn Sound which would be the Signal for us to fire in case of an attack. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</a> went with the rest of the party down the bank of the River untill we came to the lodges, where we found that they had left place 24 hours before that, &amp; had Set 2 of the largest lodges on fire which caused the Smoak. I then Sounded the horn the other party came up, we found they had tore down the meat pen which our men had built &amp; left 2 Elk in it.    they took the meat all away, except a fiew small peaces of buffaloe meat which they left in the small lodge which they broiled.    we found that they had left the River here and took up a Steep bluff in to the praries    we concluded not to follow them any further, but to turn in to hunting. Some proceeded on down the River.    4 men went down this bottom to hunt.    we marched about 10 miles and camped at the upper end of a bottom on S. S.    the hunters came up    one of them had killed a Deer which he brought in with him    2 or 3 men of the hunters went out towards evening.    one of them killed a deer &amp; a wolf.—

                  <em class="hi">Saturday 16th.</em> We renewed our pursuit early, and had a cold morning. Having proceeded twelve miles we discovered fresh smoke arising at some old camps, where we had hid some meat before <a href="#n09021601" id="ln09021601" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> when  <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clarke</a> was down; and therefore advanced with caution. Having arrived at the place we found the savages were gone; had destroyed our meat, burnt the huts and fled into the plains. This morning the Indians, who had come down with us and one of our men whose feet had been a little frozen, returned home. We hunted the 17th and 18th and got a good deal of meat which we brought to a place were some more had been secured. The 19th we loaded our sleds very heavy, and fifteen men drew one and the horse the other, which was a small one. On the next day we arrived at the fort much fatigued.
