I feel that I have a public responsibility to do this, as well as just someone who's interested in Lewis and Clark, I think that it's important for someone like myself to carry the torch for Lewis and Clark so that OK, this wasn't just an academic/scholarly endeavor and now it's done and I'm done. That I continue to have an active role and I respect the people who are working to have this Lewis and Clark commemoration and I want to be a participant in it.</p>
