The weather warm and cloudy therefore unfavourable for many operations; I keep small fires under the boat; the blowing flies are innumerable about it; the moisture retained by the bark prevents it from drying as fast as it otherwise would.    we dispatched two other hunters to kill Elk or buffaloe for their skins to cover our baggage.    we have no tents; the men are therefore obliged to have recourse to the sails for shelter from the weather and we have not more skins than are sufficient to cover our baggage when stoed away in bulk on land.    many of the men are engaged in dressing leather to cloath themselves.    their leather cloathes soon become rotton as they are much exposed to the water and frequently wet. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

I set one of the party at work to make me some sacks of the wolf skins, to transport my Instruments when occasion requirs their being carried any distance by land.—    we had a light shower of rain about 4 P. M. attended with some thunder and lightning.    one beaver caught this morning.    the musquetoes are excessively troublesome to us. I have prepared my composition which I should have put on this evening but the rain prevented me.</p>
