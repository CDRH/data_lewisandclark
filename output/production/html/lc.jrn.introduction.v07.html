         <div class="introduction  tei_div">
            <p>
On March 23, 1806, the Corps of Discovery left <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a>, their winter quarters on the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Coast" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Coast">Pacific Coast</a>, and started back up the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> on their long return journey to the United States. It was now nearly two years since they had left <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a> bound west; if they could get across the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> by the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a> early enough, they could descend the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> before it froze and reach their starting point in this same year. They were now largely retracing a route they had already followed and so did not bother with the detailed courses and distances of the outbound journey, but their journals were still filled with the incidents of the voyage and descriptions of the country and its people.</p>
            <p>
There was still room for new discoveries; on the way down the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> they had missed the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Willamette (Multnomah) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River">Willamette River</a>, concealed behind islands. They encamped for a week on the north side of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> to hunt and take astronomical observations, while <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> made a quick exploration a few miles up the new stream. The captains called it the <a class="regularization" title="Willamette (Multnomah) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River">Multnomah</a> after the Indian name and regarded it as coming from much deeper in the continent than was really the case. On April 6 the party was again on its way.</p>
            <p>
They were nearly two weeks getting upriver past the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29">Cascades</a> and the <a class="regularization" title="Celilo (Great) Falls" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Celilo%20%28Great%29%20Falls">Celilo Falls</a>. To the wearisome labor of portaging was added the aggravation of bad relations with many of the Indians in the vicinity. The natives demanded high prices for any food they sold, and some of them could not resist stealing. The captains' patience was at low ebb and they threatened violence if stolen goods were not returned. When some Indians made off with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> dog <a class="regularization" title="Seaman" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Seaman">Seaman</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> sent a party of men to recover his friend and companion, with orders to shoot if necessary. Fortunately, no one was killed and <a class="regularization" title="Seaman" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Seaman">Seaman</a> was returned to the Corps.</p>
            <p>
Once past the falls they traded canoes for horses to continue their journey by land and made their way up the north side of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> to the <a class="regularization" title="Walula Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Walula%20Indians">Walula</a> (or <a class="regularization" title="Walula Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Walula%20Indians">Walla Walla</a>) Indians, whom they found much more hospitable than those lower down the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>. On the westward journey the captains had promised <a class="regularization" title="Yelleppit" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Yelleppit">Chief Yelleppit</a> that they would remain with him for a few days on the way back. They kept their promise and camped with the <a class="regularization" title="Walula Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Walula%20Indians">Walulas</a> from April 27 to 29, at the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Walla Walla (Waller Waller) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Walla%20Walla%20%28Waller%20Waller%29%20River">Walla Walla River</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Yelleppit" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Yelleppit">Yelleppit</a> told them about an overland shortcut to the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a>, so on the thirtieth they continued eastward by land following a <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> guide they had met several days earlier. They were anxious to reach the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a>, with whom they had left their horses on the westbound trip.</p>
            <p>
This eastbound trip took the party over new ground; going west they had traveled by canoe down the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Snake</a> rivers to the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>. With the advice of their guide they now took the shortcut between the <a class="regularization" title="Walla Walla (Waller Waller) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Walla%20Walla%20%28Waller%20Waller%29%20River">Walla Walla</a> and the <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Snake</a>, passing the present towns of <a class="regularization" title="Waitsburg, Wash." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Waitsburg%2C%20Wash.">Waitsburg</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Dayton, Wash." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dayton%2C%20Wash.">Dayton</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Pomeroy, Wash." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pomeroy%2C%20Wash.">Pomeroy</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Washington" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Washington">Washington</a>. They reached the <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Snake</a> a little below the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater</a>. On the way they met <a class="regularization" title="Apash Wyakaikt" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Apash%20Wyakaikt">Wearkoomt</a>, a <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> chief who had been helpful to them on their way down the <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Snake</a> the previous fall. Having reached the <a class="regularization" title="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Snake%20%28Ki-moo-e-nim%2C%20Lewis%27s%2C%20Southeast%20Branch%20of%20Columbia%29%20River">Snake</a> and crossed it on May 4, the party continued up its north side to the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater</a> and up the north bank of that river.</p>
            <p>
Here in the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> country, in modern west-central <a class="regularization" title="Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Idaho">Idaho</a>, the captains assumed a new and demanding role as physicians to the local people. On the westward trip some medicines they had prescribed had eased the ailments of several patients, and had, said <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, "given those nativs and exolted oppinion of my skill as a phisician." During a period of nearly six weeks that they were forced to remain with the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> in May and June of 1806 they were visited by a host of the afflicted, suffering from a variety of ills, notably rheumatic complaints, sore eyes, and abscesses. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> was doubtful if any permanent cures could result, but the immediate benefit to relations with the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> was so great that he decided to continue treatment, wishing that they could indeed cure these "poor wretches."</p>
            <p>
The captains also had to mediate a dispute between the local <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> leaders. The previous fall they had left their horses with the hospital chief <a class="regularization" title="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29">Twisted Hair</a>; some more prominent chiefs who had then been absent were vexed with him on returning, thinking that he had presumed too much in taking on the responsibility. <a class="regularization" title="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29">Twisted Hair</a>, disgusted with their criticism, had let the horses wander over a considerable area. Now <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> did their best to reconcile the squabbling chiefs so that their animals could be recovered.</p>
            <p>
On May 14 the party settled in to a camp on the east side of the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater</a> at the modern town of <a class="regularization" title="Kamiah, Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kamiah%2C%20Idaho">Kamiah</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Idaho" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Idaho">Idaho</a>, where they would remain for nearly a month. The <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> told them that it would be at least that long before the snows in the <a class="regularization" title="Bitterroot (Snow) Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Bitterroot%20%28Snow%29%20Mountains">Bitterroot Mountains</a> melted sufficiently to allow passage east over the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a>. Their campsite has come to be called <a class="regularization" title="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Camp%20Chopunnish%20%28Idaho%29">Camp Chopunnish</a> after the explorers' name for the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a>. The party passed their time seeking food, counciling and socializing with the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a>, and obtaining more horses for the next stage of the trip.</p>
            <p>
Some further medical problems engaged their attention during this lengthy sojourn. <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">William Bratton</a> had been suffering ever since <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a> from a mysterious back ailment which had virtually incapacitated him. No other remedy having worked, the captains tried a sweat bath suggested by <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">John Shields</a>, the extreme heat being alternated with immersion in a cold mountain stream. In a short time <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton's</a> back loosened up and he was able to walk again. Another patient was a <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> chief who had suffered from paralysis for five years, with no apparent cause. For lack of a better remedy the captains subjected him to the sweat-bath treatment, and to their amazement he began recovering the use of his limbs.</p>
            <p>
Naturally, the two leaders continued their studies of natural history, native culture, and geography. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> gathered what information he could about country to the north and south of the party's trail, together with the locations of Indian tribes, obtaining maps from the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> continued his study of the grizzly bears, concluding that in spite of their many color variations they were all of the same species. He also discovered the cinnamon bear, a western color variant of the familiar black bear. A number of new animals and plants were described, including the pigmy horned lizard, western tanager, Columbian ground squirrel, beargrass, and ragged robin. It was probably here that they collected what seems to be the only zoological specimen of the expedition to have survived to the present day, the skin of a Lewis's woodpecker. In the land of the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> also made another discovery of a root much like the sweet potato. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> description of cous (his "cows") is unmistakable; it constituted one of the basic food sources for natives in the region.</p>
            <p>
In council <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> promised the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> that American traders would soon follow them to provide the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> with trade goods, especially guns with which to defend themselves against the <a class="regularization" title="Blackfeet Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Blackfeet%20Indians">Blackfeet</a> and other enemies. They also promised, if they should meet the <a class="regularization" title="Blackfeet Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Blackfeet%20Indians">Blackfeet</a> on their eastward trip, to try to persuade them to make peace with the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a>. Their hosts may have been a bit skeptical on this point, but the hope of obtaining weapons to match those of their enemies inspired even greater regard for their visitors. The men found much to admire about their hosts' customs, hospitality, and appearance. The traveling ethnographers recorded much about <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> material culture during the forced stay. Food, clothes, and housing, of course caught their attention and the horse culture of this equestrian people was also a matter of serious consideration. Finally, the captains tried to explain <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> attitudes, ceremonies, and rituals in their journals.</p>
            <p>
By June 9, 1806, the captains decided to begin their move eastward. According to the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perces</a> the snow would not be gone from the mountains along the <a class="regularization" title="Lolo Trail" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lolo%20Trail">Lolo Trail</a> until the beginning of July, but the whole party was anxious to start homeward, so they left the valley of the <a class="regularization" title="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Clearwater%20%28Flathead%2C%20Kooskooskee%29%20River">Clearwater</a> for the flats above the river, "exolted," <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> says, "with the idea of once more proceeding on towards their friends and Country."
