Set out at an early hour this morning.    about nine A. M. the wind arose, and shortly after became so violent that we were unabled to proceed, in short it was with much difficulty and some risk that I was enabled to get the canoes and perogues into a place of tolerable safety, there being no timber on either side of the river at this place.    some of the canoes shiped water, and wet several parsels of their lading, which I directed to be opened and aired    we remained untill five in the evening when the wind abating in some measure, we reloaded, and proceeded.    shortly after we were joined by <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> who had walked on shore this morning, and passing through the bottom lands had fallen on the river some miles above 〈us〉, and concluding that the wind had detained us, came down the river in surch of us.    he had killed three blacktaled, or mule deer, <a href="#n11042301" id="ln11042301" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and a buffaloe Calf, in the course of his ramble.    these hard winds, being so frequently repeated, become a serious source of detention to us.—    incamped on the Stard. side.— <a href="#n11042302" id="ln11042302" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
