This morning I dispatched <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Fields</a> up the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">yellowstone river</a> with orders to examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the same evening; two others were directed to bring in the meat we had killed last evening, while I proceeded down the river with one man <a href="#n11042601" id="ln11042601" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in order to take a view of the confluence of this great river with the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, which we found to be two miles distant on a direct line N. W. from our encampment.    the bottom land on the lower side of the <a class="regularization" title="Yellowstone River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Yellowstone%20River">yellowstone river</a> near it's mouth for about one mile in width appears to be subject to inundation; while that on the opposite side of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and the point formed by the junction of these rivers is of the common elivation, say from twelve to 18 feet above the level of the water, and of course not liable to be overflown except in extreem high water, which dose not appear to be very frequent    there is more timber in the neighbourhood of the junction of these rivers, and on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> as far below as the <a class="regularization" title="Little Muddy (White Earth) River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Little%20Muddy%20%28White%20Earth%29%20River">White earth river</a>, than there is on any part of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> above the entrance of the <a class="regularization" title="Cheyenne River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Cheyenne%20River">Chyenne river</a> to this place.    the timber consists principally of Cottonwood, with some small elm, ash and boxalder. <a href="#n11042602" id="ln11042602" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    the under growth on the sandbars and verge of the river is the small leafed willow; the low bottoms, rose bushes which rise to three or four fe[e]t high, the redburry, servicebury, and the redwood; the high bottoms are of two discriptions either timbered or open; the first lies next to the river and it's under brush is the same with that of the low timbered bottoms with the addition of the broaf leafed willow, Goosbury, choke cherry, purple currant; and honeysuckle bushis; the open bottoms border on the hills, and are covered in many parts by the wild hyssop which rises to the hight of two feet. I observe that the Antelope, Buffaloe Elk and deer feed on this herb; the willow of the sandbars also furnish a favorite winter food to these anamals as well as the growse, the porcupine, hare, and rabbit. <a href="#n11042603" id="ln11042603" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    about 12 Olock I heard the discharge of several guns at the junction of the rivers, which announced to me the arrival of the paty with <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a>; I afterwards learnt that they had fired on some buffaloe which they met with at that place, and of which they killed a cow and several Calves; the latter are now fine veal. I dispatched one of the men to <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> requesting him to send up a canoe to take down the meat we had killed and our baggage to his encampmt, which was accordingly complyed with.    after I had completed my observations in the evening I walked down and joined the party at their encampment on the point of land fromed by the junction of the rivers; <a href="#n11042604" id="ln11042604" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> found them all in good health, and much pleased at having arrived at this long wished for spot, and in order to add in some measure to the general pleasure which seemed to pervade our little community, we ordered a dram to be issued to each person; this soon produced the fiddle, and they spent the evening with much hilarity, singing &amp; dancing, and seemed as perfectly to forget their past toils, as they appeared regardless of those to come.    in the evening, the man I had sent up the river this morning returned, and reported that he had ascended it about eight miles on a streight line; that he found it crooked, meandering from side to side of the valley formed by it; which is from four to five miles wide.    the corrent of the river gentle, and it's bed much interrupted and broken by sandbars; at the distance of five miles he passed a large Island well covered with timber, and three miles higher a large creek falls in on the S.
