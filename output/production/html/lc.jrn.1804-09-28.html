                  <span class="italic">Friday, 28th.</span> This morning we dragged the river all around where the boat lay, but could not find the anchor. At 9 o'clock we made preparations to sail; some of the chiefs were on board, and concluded to go some distance with us. When we went to shove off, some of the Indians took hold of the rope and would not let it go. This conduct had like to be attended with bad consequences, as <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> was near giving orders to cut the rope and to fire on them. The chiefs, however, went out and talked with them: they said they wanted a carrot of tobacco, and that if we gave that we might go. The tobacco was given them, and we went off under a gentle breeze of wind. 
We passed high land on the north side and bottom on the south. We proceeded 4 miles, and then saw an Indian <a href="#n07092805" id="ln07092805" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> following us along the beach, when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> went in a periogue and brought him on board.

We passed a fine bottom covered with timber on the north side, and bare hills on the south. We made two large stones serve the purpose of an anchor, and at sunset anchored for the night, near a small sand-bar in the middle of the river.</p>

Friday 28th Sept. 1804.    we draged the river in hopes to find our anker but it was in vain.    about 9 oClock we went to Set off    Some of the chiefs was then on board and concluded to go a little ways with us.    when we were about to Shove off a nomber of warries on Shore caught hold of our cable 
and another whiped of[f] the children    the women went off also    only about 60 warries on the edge of the bank and we jest under the bank.    Some of them had fire arms and the rest had Good bows and arrows ready for war.    the consequence had like to have been bad as <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt.

the cable with his Sword and giving orders for the party to fire on them.    then the chiefs went out and Spoke to them.    they Said if we would Give them a carrit of tobacco they would loose the rope.    we gave them tobacco.    the chief after Some hesitation loosed the rope himself.    we then Set of[f]  under a fine breese of wind.    passed high land on N. S. &amp; bottom on S. S.    Saw an Indian comming up the Shore.    we hoisted a white flag, and a red flag for peace or war, and was determined to fight our way, if we could not Go without.    <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt.

               <p>
Friday September 28th    This morning the hands were all employed, (excepting the Guard) in dragging for our Anchor and Cable; but without any success, about 9 oClock A. M. we went to sett off.    some of the Indian Chiefs was then on board of the boat, and concluded to go a little way with us, We then proceeded to shove off the boat, a number of their Warriors who were on the shore caught fast hold of the Cable, one of their Warriors drove off their Women and Children from the Boat, Whilst about Sixty of their Warriors stood on the Edge of the bank of the River; and our boat lay just under the bank of it.    The Warriors were all Arm'd some of them had fire Arms, and the remainder Bows &amp; Arrows, they appeared all ready for Warr, which would have been attended with dangerous consequences to us, they having such a superiority to us in regard to Number.—    <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> was going to cut the Cable of the Boat with his sword; and to give Orders for our party, to fire on the Indians.    When their chiefs who were on board the Boat; went out and spoke to them, they told our Officers that if they would give the Warriors that held the Rope, a few Carrots of Tobacco; that they would loose the Rope.    The Officer then threw 〈a〉 some Carrotts of tobacco among them, and they left the Rope and ran to get it, One of the Chiefs which had been on board, the boat after some hesitation loosed the Cable.—</p>
               <p>
We then set out with a fair breeze of Wind, and passed some high land, lying on the North side of the River; and fine bottoms of land, lying on the South side of the River, We proceeded on, when we espied an Indian coming 
running up the Shore, the Officers order'd a White flag, and one of Red to be hoisted, as a sign to the Indians, that we were either for peace, or Warr; they being determined if we could not proceed on without fighting, that it 
should be the case; but if possible, to get on peacably;    <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> got on board one of the Pettyaugers, and proceeded to shore, to see what the Indian wanted, and to gain what information; he could from him, respecting the intention of the Indians toward us; <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captain Lewis</a> soon returned, and brought the Indian on board with him;—</p>
