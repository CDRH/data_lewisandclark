On a windy day in early April 1805, <span class="tei_name">Meriwether Lewis</span> surveyed the Corps of Discovery and its "little fleet" of canoes and pirogues, and declared that the expedition was ready "to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width, on which the foot of civilized man had never trodden." The long months at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> now over, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> enthusiastically wrote that he "could but esteem this moment of my departure as among the most happy of my life." <a href="#n0601" id="ln0601" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> But even before that long-anticipated move upriver, the explorers had formulated plans and goals that directly involved Indian peoples in the West and Pacific Northwest. Foremost was the need to locate the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   Indians and obtain horses from them. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> explained how important those horses were to the expedition's success when he wrote that "the circumstances of the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span> possessing large quantities of horses is much in our favour as by means of horses, the transport of our baggage will be rendered easy and expeditious over land, from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia river</span>." <a href="#n0602" id="ln0602" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Led to believe that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   would be encountered somewhere between the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made finding them a central goal in the second season of exploration.</p>
               <p>
The journey up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and on to <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> necessitated travel through territories frequented by Indians that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed were hostile to an American presence. As the expedition left <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, its second goal was to avoid the various 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   bands known to hunt along the banks of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> beyond the <span class="tei_name">Great Bend</span>. Branded by the explorers as people with a "turbulent and faithless disposition," the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   were viewed as a potential threat to the expedition's progress. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> explained later in the spring, "We do not wish to see those gentlemen just now." <a href="#n0603" id="ln0603" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

Searching for 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   horses and avoiding 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   warriors were tactical goals—ones that needed to be achieved in order to guarantee a successful voyage. But <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> always understood that they were more than mere travelers making a grand western tour at government expense. They went west as diplomats and agents of an American empire. Proclaiming United States sovereignty, establishing intertribal peace, and promoting trade with American merchants were unchanging objectives of the expedition. Symbolizing those goals was an unnamed <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> man who went along with the expedition when it left on April 7. He was on board, explained <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "with a view to restore peace between the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span> and those in this neighbourhood." <a href="#n0604" id="ln0604" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Although the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> peace emissary decided two days later not to hazard the journey, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were still committed to the policies toward the Indians they had promoted from the outset.</p>
               <p>
In the weeks that followed the departure from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, the expedition made good progress against the spring current of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Busy navigating the twists and turns of the river channel, they had little time to notice how few Indians were to be seen. An occasional <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> hunting party or abandoned camp was the only reminder of a native presence. Yet the concern over potential trouble with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   haunted the expedition. In mid-April the Americans began to see traces of recent 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   activity; horse tracks and empty hunting camps were worrisome signs, but they did not put the explorers on any special alert. <a href="#n0605" id="ln0605" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> They were far more intent on reaching the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> confluence. But on April 17, as the expedition was on the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend of the Missouri</span>, its fears about the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   seemed justified. At sunset, fresh 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   tracks and four timber rafts were spotted along the river bank. Both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that an 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   war party on its way to raid the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crows</span>
                   was nearby. If the expedition overtook the warriors, there could be serious trouble. <a href="#n0606" id="ln0606" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Despite fears of an untimely collision with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  , the rest of April proved peaceful. As the explorers passed the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> confluence and entered present-day <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, signs of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   and other Indian tribes continued to appear. Stick lodges, hunting camps, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   prayer cloth offerings, and sweat lodges all told that the expedition was not alone on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. <a href="#n0607" id="ln0607" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Early in May, when the Americans were in northeastern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, increased evidence of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   movement once again put <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on guard. On May 8, at the <span class="tei_name">Milk River</span>, the explorers came upon a place "where an Indian had recently grained, or taken the hair off of a goatskin." <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> belief that the Indians were 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> report of possible smoke and tepees some distance up <span class="tei_name">Milk River</span> convinced the captains that real danger was near. <a href="#n0608" id="ln0608" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Two days later there was another alarm. During the morning, as the explorers made a brief stop just past <span class="tei_name">Stick Lodge Creek</span> upriver from present-day <span class="tei_name">Fort Peck dam</span>, a dog wandered into the expedition's camp. Taking this to be a sure sign that Indians were close at hand and certain they were 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sent out hunters "to scower the country." Fearing an attack by Indians <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> characterized as "a vicious illy disposed nation." the captains set the whole party to checking weapons and ammunition. When the scouts returned and reported no warriors about, the alert ended as quickly as it had come. <a href="#n0609" id="ln0609" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
For the rest of May and well into June, the expedition's energies were taken up in navigating the river through the <span class="tei_name">Missouri Breaks</span>. Although the <span class="tei_name">Breaks</span> and the <span class="tei_name">White Rocks</span> region offered what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> poetically described as "seens of visionary inchantment," there was little time to appreciate such natural wonders. Sandbars, rapids, and falling banks made the task of pulling boats against the current ever more demanding. Struggling toward the <span class="tei_name">Judith River</span>, the explorers continued to note "strong evidences of Indians being on the river above us, and probably at no great distance." <a href="#n0610" id="ln0610" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> More deserted stick lodges, a tepee pole that bore signs of use as part of a travois, and other native goods were steady reminders of the crowded wilderness. On May 29, at the <span class="tei_name">Judith River</span>, there were two vivid marks of Indian life. Walking along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> at a point just above the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Judith</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> counted the fires of 126 recently occupied tepees. Close by, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> observed the rings of an older tepee encampment numbering some 100 lodges. Once again anxiety about the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   surfaced as the captains brought <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> some worn-out moccasins from the sites for her identification. After careful examination, she declared that they were not of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   origin but were probably made by <span class="tei_name">Atsinas</span>. Relieved that they were not the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                  ', the explorers may have been equally disappointed that the camps were not 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  . If the moccasins were visual signs of Indian life along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the powerful stench of rotting buffalo carcasses was an equally potent reminder of the native presence. Although recent archaeological studies by W. Raymond Wood have indicated that the route of travel for May 29 did not pass a buffalo jump, the mass of buffalo remains did prompt <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to write a detailed description of a <em class="hi">pishkun</em> or jump and the dangerous techniques used by Indians to lure animals over the edge. <a href="#n0611" id="ln0611" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>

               <p>
By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his advance party reached the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri</span> on June 13, 1805, the expedition had been traveling for over two months, and once past the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> there had been no encounters with Indians. The goal of avoiding 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   or other potentially hostile natives was achieved more by good fortune than skill. But as the explorers labored over the grueling <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> portage, the captains thought increasingly about finding 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   horses. Their growing concern can be measured by an important decision made during the portage. Earlier in the journey, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had given some thought to sending one canoe and a few men back to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> from the falls carrying news of the party. That plan was now quietly abandoned, partly because it might have discouraged the whole group and, perhaps more important, because "not haveing seen the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span> or knowing in fact whither to calculate on their friendship or hostillity, we have conceived our party sufficiently small." Although it is not clear from the expedition's record whether <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> led the explorers to expect to find the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   near the falls, there certainly were indications that those Indians had been in the area recently. <a href="#n0612" id="ln0612" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> On July 16, one day after the explorers finished the portage, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was taking one of his usual walks along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> when he came upon a large and recent 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   camp. Spotting what would later be familiar to him as the cone-shaped 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   brush wickiup and also noting much horse sign, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> concluded that he had "much hope of meeting with these people shortly." <a href="#n0613" id="ln0613" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Convinced that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were just days away and could provide both horses and "information relative to the geography of the country," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made an important decision. On July 18, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took an advance party consisting of <span class="tei_name">York</span>, <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span>, and <span class="tei_name">John Potts</span> on ahead. Moving quickly, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped to find the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   before they were frightened by hunters' guns from the larger group. <a href="#n0614" id="ln0614" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> In the days that followed, both <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> forward team and <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> main contingent strained for any hint that their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   search was over. Saturday, July 20, brought more 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   signs but no Indians. Early in the morning <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> saw smoke up <span class="tei_name">Potts' Creek</span>. Unsure of the smoke's significance, the explorer thought it was either accidental or a deliberate Indian signal. According to his journal entry for the day, he learned later that some 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   had seen either his or <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> men, feared they were <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> warriors, and fled from the river. Later the same day <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> force, painfully working its way up a path filled with sharp rocks and prickly pear along <span class="tei_name">Pryor's Valley Creek</span>, saw a second smoke signal. Eager to let Indians know they were friends, not enemy raiders, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men took to scattering pieces of clothing, paper, and linen tape along their route. <a href="#n0615" id="ln0615" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Despite these efforts, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   seemed as tantalizingly out of reach as their smoke signals.</p>
               <p>
Frustrated by their failure to contact the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and increasingly tired by the rigors of a difficult river passage, the expedition pressed on toward the Three Forks. Although the explorers never expected Sacagawea to guide them in the usual sense of the word, they did hope she would recognize some of the country once the expedition entered 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   hunting grounds. But it was not until July 22 that the Indian woman began to see country remembered from those days before her kidnaping by <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. As the main body of the expedition neared <span class="tei_name">Pryor's Valley Creek</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> pointed out familiar landmarks and assured <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that this was "the river on which her relations live[d], and that the <span class="tei_name">three forks</span> [were] at no great distance." Tacitly admitting just how worried the whole Corps of Discovery was at not yet finding the Indians, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> news "cheered the sperits of the party who now begin to console themselves with the anticipation of shortly seeing the head of the <span class="tei_name">missouri</span> yet unknown to the civilized world." Later that evening, with both the advance party and the main body reunited, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> planned strategy for what they felt was an imminent meeting with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Believing that the Indians would be found at <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, the captains decided to send <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> again with a small group to reconnoiter the route and make initial contact. <a href="#n0616" id="ln0616" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Excited by the prospect that their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   quest might soon be ended and that Indian horses would carry them over an easy portage to <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> waters, the two groups set out the next morning. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took with him <span class="tei_name">Robert Frazer</span>, <span class="tei_name">Joseph</span> and <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>. To reassure Indians that they were friends, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered that small American flags fly from every canoe. While <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> followed Indian paths toward <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the boats pressed upriver. Each group found the going difficult and exhausting. Hiking over broken terrain filled with sharp rocks and prickly pear, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> men suffered twisted ankles and lacerated feet. The boat crews had it no less easy. The <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> was now a narrow channel choked with willow islands, rocky shallows, and unexpected rapids. Towing their craft from the shore exposed the men's moccasined feet to the needle spines of the prickly pear. Working boats in the water became a back-breaking, bone-chilling enterprise. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> understated the obvious when he wrote, "The party in general are much fatigued." But swollen feet and aching bones would have been gladly accepted had the effort produced a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   encounter. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reached <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> on July 25, he found a fire-blackened prairie and horse tracks but no Indians. Two days later <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the main body came to <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, found <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> note detailing what he had discovered thus far, and saw for themselves that the valley held only silence. <a href="#n0617" id="ln0617" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>

The <span class="tei_name">Three Forks of the Missouri</span> was what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> described it to be, "an essential point in the geography of this western part of the Continent." But one of the essentials was missing. Without Indian horses the expedition would be stranded on the wrong side of the <span class="tei_name">Great Divide</span>. Facing a second winter east of the mountains, on short rations and unsure of the route ahead, the expedition was at a desperate point. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> put it bluntly: "We begin to feel considerable anxiety with rispect to the <span class="tei_name">Snake Indians</span>. If we do not find them or some other nation who have horses I fear the successful issue of our voyage will be very doubtful or at all events much more difficult in it's accomplishment." <a href="#n0618" id="ln0618" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The explorers did not understand that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   bands did not come across the mountains and into the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> region until September. At the very moment when the worried captains were holding talks plotting what to do next, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   were still busy fishing along the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span> and <span class="tei_name">Salmon</span> rivers.</p>
               <p> 
The expedition camped at <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, where <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> had been kidnaped from a

                   band some five years earlier. It was a time to treat blistered and infected feet, repair clothing and moccasins, and dry dampened papers and trade goods. But the most important task at <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> was formulation of a plan to locate the elusive 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Perhaps guided by information supplied by <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, the explorers now believed the Indians were either further up the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson River</span> or across the mountains still fishing. <a href="#n0619" id="ln0619" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Wherever they were, they had to be found. Using a tactic employed before, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> decided to send a scouting party ahead while the main group continued up the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>. Since <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was still recovering from an infection caused by prickly pear punctures, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> led the scouts. <a href="#n0620" id="ln0620" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The first week of August 1805 must have seemed an eternity to the frustrated and exhausted men of the expedition. Everything that could go awry did. Laboring up the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> in a channel that was barely navigable, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> boat crews slipped in the mud, tripped over hidden rocks, and spent hours waist-deep in cold water. Men who usually did not complain in the face of hardship were now "so much fortiegued that they wished much that navigation was at an end that they might go by land." <a href="#n0621" id="ln0621" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Canoes overturned, tow ropes broke, and the air was blue with tough talk. As a last straw, a beaver had gnawed through the green willow branch holding a message from <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, causing the boats to make a needless and painful detour up the <span class="tei_name">Big Hole (Wisdom) River</span>. And <span class="tei_name">George Shannon</span> got lost on a hunting trek up the <span class="tei_name">Big Hole</span>. The efforts of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> scouting party to locate the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were no more successful than previous ones. There were signs of Indian activity, but as before they yielded neither people nor horses. When the two captains again joined forces on August 6 and proceeded up the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, they had to face some harsh realities. Several men, including <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, were injured and in pain, while many others were near exhaustion. Valuable trade goods, medicine, and powder were wet and damaged. Food supplies were uncertain. And above all, there was the inescapable fact that unless the expedition found horses very soon it would have to pack only a fraction of its supplies across the divide and look for a place to winter in mountains known for their scarcity of game. The men's spirits and prospects would not be as low again until the bitter days in the snows of the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span>.</p>
               <p>
These bleak prospects began to change on August 8. With the explorers just below the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Ruby (Philanthropy) River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> recognized "the point of a high plain to our right which she informed us was not very distant from the summer retreat of her nation on a river beyond the mountains which runs to the west." Known to Indians as the <span class="tei_name">Beaver's Head</span> because it reminded them of a swimming beaver, the rock brought both hope and a sense of urgency to the expedition. "As it is now all important with us to meet those people as soon as possible," the captains decided to once again send <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> on ahead with <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span>, and <span class="tei_name">John Shields</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> vowed to find horses if it took a month of hard travel. <a href="#n0622" id="ln0622" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> On the next morning, August 9, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men swung on their packs and began to follow the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson River</span> toward the mountains. The whole future of the expedition depended on <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> success in finding the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and trading for horses in something less than a month.</p>
               <p>
All day on August 9, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men tracked along the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>. Seeing the river "very crooked much divided by islands, shallow, rocky in many places and very rapid," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> worried that <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> boats might not be able to make the passage. On the following day the explorers "fel in with a plain Indian road" which took them past <span class="tei_name">Rattlesnake Cliffs</span> to a fork in the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead River</span>. Because the path also forked and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> did not want to waste time on the wrong trail, he dispatched <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> up one way while <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> took the other. Sensing that this fork also marked the end of navigable waters, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> left a note for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> telling him to go no further until the advance party returned. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men now set out along <span class="tei_name">Horse Prairie Creek</span>, a small stream that flowed from the West. <span class="tei_name">Horse Prairie Creek</span> led the explorers into <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span>, described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> as one of the "handsomest" coves he had ever seen. Camping that night in the cove, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men ate venison roasted over a willow brush fire and wondered what lay beyond the dividing ridge. <a href="#n0623" id="ln0623" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Sunday, August 11, proved to be one of the most important days for the expedition. It was a day equally important for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   of <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> band camped over the divide along the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>. Soon after <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men set out from their camp in <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span> the Indian trail vanished in dense sagebrush. Anxious not to miss what proved to be <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span> over the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead Mountains</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> to walk on the captain's right flank while <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> would cover the left. <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> was to remain with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> as the whole formation moved slowly through the cove and toward the pass. Five miles of this maneuver got <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> closer to <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span>, but it still seemed no nearer to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Then suddenly, some two miles off, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spotted an Indian horse and rider cantering toward him. With the aid of his small telescope, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> identified the Indian as a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  . The armed warrior was riding an "eligant" horse and had not yet seen the Americans. Overjoyed at the prospect of finally meeting the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> walked slowly toward the Indian. The explorer was certain that once the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   saw his white skin any fears would disappear. With about a mile now separating the two the Indian stopped and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> is likewise halted. Determined to make some friendly gesture, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> took his blanket and waved it three times in the air. Perhaps <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> had told him that this was the accepted sign for peaceful conversation between strangers. But the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   apparently discounted <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> signal and watched with mounting suspicion as <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> drew closer. Unable to catch the attention of either man, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> feared that their continued march would frighten the Indian and dash any hopes of a friendly meeting. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> took a few strands of beads, a mirror, and some other trade items and began to walk alone toward the still-mounted Indian. When the men were no more than two hundred paces apart, the Indian slowly turned his horse and began to ride away. In desperation <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> shouted out the word "tab-ba-bone," which he believed was 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   for whiteman. The explorer knew that <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> had to be stopped or all would be lost. Risking a shout and some vigorous waving, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> commanded both men to halt. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> obeyed but <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> evidently did not see the signal. The Indian moved off a bit more and then stopped a second time. With steady determination <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> resumed walking toward the man, again saying "tab-ba-bone," holding up the trade goods, and even stripping up his shirt sleeves to show white skin. But none of this worked and when the two were no more than one hundred paces apart, the Indian whipped up his horse and vanished into the willow brush.</p>
               <p>
"With him," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "vanished all my hopes of obtaining horses for the present." Depressed and angry, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> rounded up his men and "could not forbare abraiding them a little for their want of attention and imprudence on this occasion." Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> blamed <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> for the failure at <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span>, other factors were also at work. The <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   had just suffered a punishing raid at the hands of Atsina warriors and were bound to view any stranger with considerable suspicion. More important, there was the matter of the word "tab-ba-bone." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had probably asked either <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> or <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> for a word meaning "whiteman." Since that word did not exist in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   vocabulary, the explorer was given the term for stranger or foreigner. The Indian kinship world was divided between relatives who were friends and strangers who were potential enemies. Shouting "tab-ba-bone" to an already fearful 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   was hardly the way to begin a successful talk.</p>
               <p>
Knowing that the day's opportunity was lost, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> decided to pause in the cove for breakfast. While the rest of the men cooked, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> prepared a small parcel of beads, moccasin awls, paint, and a mirror. Tying the goods to a pole stuck in the ground near the campfire, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> hoped the gifts would attract 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   attention and convince them that the strangers were interested in trading, not raiding. A sudden rain shower made following the <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni's</span> tracks impossible. Wet grass hampered walking and a maze of horse prints made deciding which track to follow difficult and frustrating. Camping that night at the head of <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> may well have wondered whether the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   would forever remain just beyond his grasp. <a href="#n0624" id="ln0624" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>

               <p>
For the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   of <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> band, August 11, 1805, had seemed like any other day in late summer. Groups of women and children were out on the prairies digging roots. Others were busy at fish weirs or gigging for salmon with sharp, barbed sticks. Most men were occupied with hunting or tending to the needs of horses and weapons. One man who had been out riding near a creek on the other side of the mountains saw strangers whose faces he had described as "pale as ashes." But the report seemed preposterous and after some talk it was dismissed as an idle boast. What counted that day was that the band would soon join 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   friends in journeying toward the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> for the buffalo season. They would no longer be <em class="hi">ágaideka'a</em>, or salmon eaters, but <em class="hi">kutsendeka'a</em>, those who ate the buffalo. There would be danger from enemies like the <span class="tei_name">Atsinas</span> and <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, but there would also be fresh meat to end days of near starvation. That anything might alter the familiar seasonal rhythm was almost unthinkable. <a href="#n0625" id="ln0625" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> expected the next day to bring the long-hoped-for 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   encounter. Early that morning <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> sent <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span> out to track. Continuing on the trail as it led toward <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> saw places where Indian women had been digging roots. Brush lodges were also signs that the <span class="tei_name">Shoshinis</span> were near. Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party did not find the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   on August 12, it was a memorable day. Near the crest of the pass the explorers found "the most distant fountain of the waters of the Mighty <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>." Later recalling <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> standing astride the headwaters creek, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> exalted that "thus far I had accomplished one of those great objects on which my mind has been unalterably fixed for many years." After drinking from the stream and resting for a moment, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men crossed the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span>—the first Americans to make the passage—and stood looking at the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Mountains</span>. Not even those "immence ranges of high mountains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow" could dampen <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> enthusiasm as he drank at the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span> and for the first time tasted western waters. <a href="#n0626" id="ln0626" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> For all the glory and excitement of the day, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> must have known that the expedition's essential problem remained unsolved. Seeing one 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , observing many Indian signs, and crossing the divide did not bring horses into the explorers' corral.</p>
               <p>
Breaking camp on August 13 somewhere down a mountain slope toward the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men followed the Indian trail as it led into the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span> Valley. After covering about four miles, the explorers' attention was drawn to a ridge directly in front of them. Up on the ridge, watching them intently, were two 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   women, a man, and several dogs. Frightened by the sudden appearance of strangers, two of the Indians sat on the ground as if preparing for the arrival of enemy raiders. When the Americans were no more than half a mile from the Indians, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> ordered his men to halt. Leaving his rifle and pack, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> picked up a large American flag, unfurled it, and walked slowly toward the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . Despite <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> cautious approach, the Indian fled. Perhaps once again the word "tab-ba-bone" was more damaging than he understood. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were gone but their dogs were more inquisitive, sniffing and barking at the strangers. Seizing on any tactic that might convince the Indians of his peaceful intentions, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> tried to tie trade goods to the dogs' necks. But the animals were too skittish and the plan failed.</p>
               <p>
Intent on finding the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men began to backtrack along a dusty trail that "appeared to have been much traveled lately both by men and horses." After about a mile of moving through the steep ravines of the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span> Valley, the explorers suddenly stumbled on three 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   women. One immediately fled in terror, but an elderly woman and a young girl calmly sat on the ground with their heads down, waiting for what they must have thought was certain death at the hand of hostile strangers. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> walked up to the two frightened Indians, took the older woman by the hand, and repeated the now-familiar "tab-ba-bone." At the same time, he pushed up one shirt sleeve to reveal white skin. Seeing that the women were somewhat more calm, he handed out some gifts. Worried that the one woman who ran away might alarm nearby 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   warriors, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> made signs for the older woman to call back her companion. The explorer knew from <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> that vermilion symbolized peace for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , and he promptly daubed the women's faces with paint as one more way to communicate his intentions. Once again using signs, he asked them to guide the Americans to the main Indian encampment.</p>
               <p>
Led by the Indian women along a trail beside the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men were suddenly confronted by a band of some sixty mounted warriors riding at full speed. Warned by one of the Indians who had seen <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> earlier in the day, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> had marshaled his warriors and was now prepared to do battle. Acting quickly <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> dropped his gun, held up a flag, and walked toward the advancing Indians. Out ahead of the main warrior party rode the band chief <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> and two lesser chiefs. Seeing <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the women, the chief reined up his horse, had a hurried talk with the women who excitedly showed them their gifts, and then rode on toward <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. In that moment when <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> and his fellow chiefs were coming toward him, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> must have wondered just what sort of reception to expect. Any fears he had quickly evaporated as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   chiefs warmly embraced him and repeated the word "ah-hi-e," "I am much pleased." What followed was a great festival of embracing and shouting as the Americans were "all carresed and besmeared with their grease and paint" until <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted he was "heartily tired of the national hug." Following proper plains diplomatic protocol, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> sat on the ground with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and smoked a pipe. To show their good faith and genuine welcome, the Indians removed their moccasins during the ritual smoke. Once the smoking was finished, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> moved to cement good relations with his new-found friends. While he distributed trade goods—including a generous amount of blue beads and vermilion—<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> used signs to explain briefly that he and his friends were in 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   country for peace and trade. Hot and thirsty from what had already seemed a very long day, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was anxious to get on toward the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   camp. But <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> was in no particular hurry and preferred to savor the moment by giving two long speeches to his warriors. It was not until late in the afternoon that the explorers and their native escort came to the Indian camp along the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>.</p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> thought that he and his men could rest for the remainder of the day, he had not taken the measure of just how much the Americans were a curiosity and a social happening. Ushered into a skin tepee, the only one still owned by the band after the recent <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> raid, the explorers were ceremoniously seated on green boughs and antelope skins. Once again there was ritual smoking, as explorers and Indians sat facing each other across what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> characterized as a "little magic circle." The ceremony complete, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spoke through <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> signs to explain who they were, what their mission was, and what they hoped to obtain from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> talked, the crowd around the tepee swelled with women and children intent on seeing the outlandish pale beings. Now late in the evening, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> recalled that he had eaten nothing since the previous night. His request for food brought some serviceberry and chokecherry cakes, plain food but for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men a welcome meal. The berry cakes satisfied <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> stomach, but a small bit of salmon did more to gratify his mind. That salmon convinced him that "we were on the waters of the <span class="tei_name">Pacific Ocean</span>."</p>
               <p>
But any hope <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had of an easy passage to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> was shattered when <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> told him about the treacherous course of the <span class="tei_name">Salmon River</span>. For now, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> consoled himself with the belief that "this account had been exagerated with a view to detain us among them." Exhausted by one of the most momentous days in the life of the expedition, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> left <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shields</span>, and <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> to dance with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   while he sought "a tolerable sound night's repose." <a href="#n0627" id="ln0627" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>

               <p>
The day had been every bit as momentous for <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> people. Their familiar patterns of hunting, fishing, gathering, and preparing for the annual buffalo hunt had been interrupted by the arrival of strangers whose appearance was disturbing and whose intentions were unknown. Although northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   had long been exposed to European goods from Spanish sources, there is little evidence to suggest that anyone in the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span> bands had ever seen a white man. It is difficult to know just what the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   thought of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the others. Certainly they were fascinated and delighted with the gifts, including mirrors that were described in one oral tradition as "things like solid water, which were sometimes brilliant as the sun, and which sometimes showed us our faces." Dazzled by those mirrors and the sudden arrival of pale strangers, many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   imagined <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men were "the children of the Great Spirit."</p>
               <p>
But not every 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   in camp that night was filled with wonder and delight. There was a great deal of suspicion. A number of warriors believed that <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> party were really agents for the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> or some other hostile people. That fear was increased by the weapons carried by the explorers as well as by <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> request that the band go to <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span> to aid <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party. Despite all the dancing and good cheer in camp that night, the Indians' fears were growing. Those fears would have to be confronted and resolved if the expedition was to gain the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  ' cooperation. <a href="#n0628" id="ln0628" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Knowing he had to give <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> weary boat crews time to navigate the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead River</span> as far as the forks, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> decided to spend a day at the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   camp. That extra day would serve <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> needs as well as give <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> an opportunity to gain additional geographical information from <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. The explorer spent most of the morning working on his journal and talking through <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> signs with the chief. At midday <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> decided to organize a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   move toward the rendezvous with <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wanted <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> to provide porters and at least thirty horses to carry the expedition's baggage over <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span> and on to the Indian village. The chief seemingly agreed and, after a long speech to his warriors, told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that everyone would be ready to move the next morning. That news, and a report from <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   had some four hundred fine horses and mules, gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> reason to believe that his effort to gain Indian support was succeeding. <a href="#n0629" id="ln0629" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had hoped that on the following morning, August 15, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> band and their horses would be ready to make the journey back across the divide. But despite his efforts at gentle persuasion, it became increasingly clear throughout the morning that the Indians were reluctant to leave camp. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> repeatedly encouraged his people to leave their river village and follow <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, but the chief's efforts failed and an exasperated <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> finally demanded to know what was wrong. As <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> explained it, "Some foolish persons among them had suggested the idea that we were in league with the <span class="tei_name">Pahkees [Siksika Blackfeet]</span> and had come on in order to decoy them into an ambuscade where their enimies were waiting to receive them." While <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> claimed that he did not share his warriors' apprehensions, the chief's behavior both that day and the next suggests that he was quite worried. For these 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   there was ground for fear even if it infuriated <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. The band had suffered severe economic and personal losses at the hands of everyone from the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>. Outgunned and perhaps outmanned by an unknown force, the Indians had every reason to be wary.</p>
               <p>
At the same time, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> realized the necessity of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   cooperation in ferrying men and equipment over the pass and their overall support in providing horses if no water route to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> could be found. Seeking both to reassure and prod the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> told them he was disappointed in their lack of confidence in his good character. Aware of how much the Indians wanted manufactured goods, he threatened to block any future trade in guns and ammunition. As a final shot, the explorer raised doubts about the valor of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   men, saying that those who refused to help him were cowards. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> believed he had "touched the right string" when he questioned native courage. Whatever caused the turnabout, several warriors now joined <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> and declared their readiness to make the trip. Theirs was not a popular decision, and as the joint 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  -American party left camp "several of the old women were crying and imploring the great spirit to protect their warriors as if they were going to inevitable destruction." <a href="#n0630" id="ln0630" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> As explorers and Indians camped that night at the upper end of <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> might well have pondered his fate and that of the expedition if <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party did not appear the next day.</p>
               <p>
What should have been a pleasant reunion between <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on August 16 proved instead to be a day filled with tension, fear, and deception. Early in the morning, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> sent out <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shields</span> to do some hunting. Without meaning to, the explorer promptly increased the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  ' suspicions when he asked the Indians to be quiet lest they frighten the game. Thinking that they were now the hunted quarry, two groups of Indians rode off down the cove to shadow <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and <span class="tei_name">Shields</span>. It was not a good way to begin the day, and things soon became even more tense. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> made their way down through the cove, one of the Indian scouts came riding up the plain at full whip. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> first thought was that by "some unfortunate accident" a hostile war party was in the neighborhood and had been confused with the main expedition group. All fears were quickly allayed when the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   announced his news, explaining that <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> had killed a deer and all were invited to feast on it. As hungry Indians ate the uncooked meat, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> took note that the fear of possible ambush had reduced the caravan to no more than twenty-eight men and three women. Since the women were expected to play the porter role, his count was not reassuring.</p>
               <p>
With the bloody meal over, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> carefully explained to <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> just where the main body of the expedition would be encountered. The chief replied by placing skin tippets or mantles around the necks of the Americans. Although impressed with the tippets, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> believed that they were an attempt to disguise the explorers as one more move to prepare for a possible ambush. Not wanting to arouse any suspicions, he accepted the tippet and gave <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> his army cocked hat. Wearing a buckskin shirt and sporting a dark summer tan, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> looked "a complete Indian." By now his central concern was that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would not be at the appointed place and that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   would turn either violent or uncooperative. When the explorers and their Indian escort came to within two miles of the forks of the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> could see that <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> boats were not there. Genuinely worried, he watched as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   cautiously slowed their pace. Writing later in his journal, the explorer admitted that he simply did not know what to do. With a determination bred of desperation, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> handed <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> his gun, telling him that "if his enemies were in those bushes before him that he could defend himself with that gun." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> claimed that for his part he did not fear death and challenged <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> to shoot him if the Americans were guilty of deception. Following <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> bold move, the other explorers gave their guns to the warriors. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> quick thinking temporarily quieted the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  ' fears. It also gave the captain time to seize on a second strategem to retain the Indians' confidence. Recalling the notes he had tied to a stake as a means of communication with <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> now claimed that the letters were actually written by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> boldly told <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> that the expedition was having difficulty navigating the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and "was coming up slowly." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> later admitted that lying to the chief, although justified by the occasion, "set a little awkward."</p>
               <p>
Neither <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> nor the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   slept well that night. Most of the Indians camped away from the fire light, hiding in the brush to avoid being caught in an enemy raid. Many of them continued to doubt the wisdom of trusting the strangers. Bitterness mounted against <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> as several warriors charged the chief with exposing them to unnecessary danger. Perhaps seeing through some of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> tales, some 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   insisted that the Americans were telling different and contradictory stories. Still smarting from the recent <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> raid, these wary warriors found only a fitful sleep. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> night was no less troubled. Filled with gloomy thoughts, he turned over in his mind all the possible causes for <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> delay. His greatest fear was that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had found the river so difficult that the main body had halted well below the forks. If <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> group did not appear the next day, the Indians would abandon <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men. "I knew," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> later, "that if these people left me that they would immediately disperse and secrete themselves in the mountains where it would be impossible to find them or at least in vain to pursue them and that they would spread the allarm to all other bands within our reach &amp; of course we should be disappointed in obtaining horses, which would vastly retard and increase the labour of our voyage and I feared might so discourage the men as to defeat the expedition altogether." Feigning unconcern but in reality as worried as "the most affrighted Indian," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> tried to maintain the Indians' confidence with stories, told around a willow brush fire, of <span class="tei_name">York</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, and the great store of goods the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   would get in trade for their horses. <a href="#n0631" id="ln0631" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Among the many remarkable days and nights of the expedition, this day and its tension-filled night must have long remained in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> memory. For the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , it was their last night before entering the world of white men.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> guess that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the boat crews were having great difficulty navigating the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead River</span> proved correct. Its swift current and shallow channel had tested the expedition's strength almost to the limit of endurance. Early on the morning of August 17, 1805, the boat crews set out for another day's battle with the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead</span>. At the same time, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> nervously sent out <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> and an Indian companion with a note urging <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to come on with all possible speed. By midmorning <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was at the forks of the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead</span>. Anxious not to miss any trace of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> or the Indians, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> walked out ahead. About a mile from the forks, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw several mounted Indians riding toward him. <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, who had evidently gotten ahead of <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, "began to dance and show every sign of joy" as they recognized the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> sucked her fingers as a sign that these men belonged to her own people. As the explorer and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   party neared each other, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recognized <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>. The meeting took place with "great signs of joy." Some time later, as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> moved up toward what would soon become <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span>, one of the Indians reported to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> that whites had been seen and were coming upriver. The stage was now set for a grand reunion and serious 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   negotiations.</p>
               <p>
The arrival at <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span> had all the elements of pageantry and fictional romance. In his understated way, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was "much gratifyed" by <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> appearance. But there was nothing understated about the Indians' reception. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> hair was festooned with shells and he was subjected to the usual round of "national hugs." While <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> was busy welcoming <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as something akin to a visiting god, other 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   watched in astonishment at the parade of men, boats, and equipment. Not only fascinated with clothing, guns, and canoes, the Indians gaped at <span class="tei_name">York's</span> blackness and "the segassity of <span class="tei_name">Capt. Lewis's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">dog</span>." In the midst of all this excitement there was another reunion yet more dramatic and improbable. As the baggage was being taken from the canoes, one of the three 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   women in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> group recognized <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>. The two women had been captured in the same <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> raid. No sooner had these two sat down than <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> began to stare at <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. Suddenly recognizing him as her brother, "she jumped up, ran &amp; embraced him, &amp; threw her blanket over him and cried profusely." In a week that had seen tension, fear, deception, and determination, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> homecoming was not out of place. Once again the stars had danced for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>.</p>
               <p>
Toward late afternoon, with baggage and people sorted out, the captains prepared for some serious talk with <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> and the other 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   chiefs. Sitting under an enclosure of willow brush and sail cloth, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> began their usual diplomatic litany. Not trusting to <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> signs, the captains employed a cumbersome translation chain consisting of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, and <span class="tei_name">François Labiche</span>. By this means, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> was told "the objects which had brought us into this distant part of the country." But even more important than explaining the expedition's goals or fitting the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   into the American trade system was the need for Indian horses. Hoping to interest the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   in horse trading, the captains declared that their principal purpose for making so hazardous a journey was to discover a practical trade route for American merchandise. Because the trade could not begin until the explorers had fulfilled their mission, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> pointedly reminded <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> it would be "mutually advantageous to them as well as to ourselves that they should render us such aids as they had it in their power to furnish to hasten our voyage and of course our return home."</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> certainly got the message. Faced with well-armed enemies and an uncertain supply of manufactured goods from Spanish sources, he could hardly reject the opportunity to have a place in the new American trade system. Guns and ammunition, especially, were on the chief's mind. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> counted only two or three guns and no ammunition among the warriors at <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span>. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> personal war name, <span class="tei_name">Too-et-te-con'l or Black Gun</span>, was just one more indication of the special emphasis northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   placed on firearms. Without thinking much about the consequences of arming the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  —consequences that would be felt by <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   warriors—<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made any promise in order to obtain the necessary horses. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> apparent agreement to provide whatever was required was followed by the usual program of handing out medals to chiefs, distributing gifts to onlookers, and showing off the always impressive airgun.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finished the eventful day plotting strategy for crossing the Continental Divide and finding western waters. Their plan called for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, and eleven men to cross the divide and follow the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>. <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> were to remain at the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   village, organizing the Indians' efforts to carry expedition baggage over the pass. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men were to reconnoiter possible water routes to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. While these efforts were taking place west of the divide, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> proposed to remain at <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span> to supervise the transportation over <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span>. Both expedition parties would eventually join forces at the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>

The six days <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> spent at <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span> were his first extended opportunity to study and record major features of northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   culture. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> descriptions of the objects that made up the daily life of the Indians revealed just how much he had learned during the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> apprenticeship.

                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   informant and a reliable translator. Nor could he depend on well-informed white traders like those at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Rather, he had to rely on careful observation; an occasional detail would be added later by <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> or <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. Despite such problems, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> discovered and recorded a vast store of information about 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   life. <a href="#n0633" id="ln0633" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>

               <p>
Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had begun to note important aspects of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   life as early as August 13, it was not until August 19 that the explorer undertook a systematic description of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   material culture. Using the now-familiar categories first employed to analyze Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villager ways, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote about 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   physical appearance, population, disease, clothing, and weapons. Hunting techniques, fishing methods, cooking pots, spoons, and tobacco pipes all were noted in the explorer's record. So long as there were objects for him to look at, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was able to provide masterful descriptions. But when dealing with social values and personal relations, he tended to rely on traditional European stereotypes of Indians.</p>
               <p>
Because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> could handle clothing and observe it with his keen naturalist's eye, he filled his journal with words about moccasins, leggings, shirts, robes, and ornaments. Every piece of clothing, and often its method of construction, was described with his typical attention to detail. But no article in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   wardrobe so captivated the explorer as the ermine tippet given to him by <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> described it as "the most eligant peice of Indian dress I ever saw." <a href="#n0634" id="ln0634" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Always interested in weapons, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> took special note of the various kinds of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   bows and arrows. Recognizing that sacred forces were often attached to certain weapons, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> took time to record the construction of and special ceremonies surrounding 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   hide shields. As he explained it, the preparation of a buffalo-hide shield required several days of feasting and ritual during which band elders and shamans carefully worked the skin. If both the sacred and secular processes were properly done, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   believed that the shield would repel arrows and bullets. <a href="#n0635" id="ln0635" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Skilled at describing the shapes and uses of native objects, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> found it more difficult to discuss the Indian band's social behavior without falling back on the clichés used by Europeans for centuries. He depicted 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   men as lazy husbands who mistreated their wives while lavishing attention on a favorite horse. He saw Indian women as squaw drudges who did all the heavy work and hardly paused during a supposedly painless childbirth. Indian parents spoiled their sons and sold their daughters to the highest bidder. The explorer insisted that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   men and women engaged in easy sex, and although he noted that virtue among women was more valued than in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villages, he asserted that it was not above price. The expedition's commitment to ethnographic externals suited <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> skills and some of his cultural biases. He could bring to life a weapon or a skin shirt, but the people who created those objects always seemed just beyond his reach.</p>
               <p>
No place was that more plain than in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> attempt to describe the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   character. By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reached the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , the explorers had a well-developed set of ideas about plains natives. The <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers were potential customers and allies to be courted and protected. They were, in <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> memorable phrase, "durtey, kind, pore, and extravigent." But buffalo and horse plains people like the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboins</span>
                   held a very different place in the explorers' mind. Those tribes were viewed as hostile, unreliable, and innately violent. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> attempted to evaluate the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   temperament, he was caught between those negative judgments and the fact that he and others in the expedition found much to admire about <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> people. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were honest, well-behaved, and considerate. They would share food with strangers without question even if there was little to go around. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admired their personal bravery and recognized the rough equality that made "every man a chief." But at heart he saw 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   men and women not as adults but as mercurial and ignorant children. Angry at the necessity for Indian support to cross <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> lamented the fate of the expedition "which appeared at this moment to depend in a great measure upon the caprice of a few savages who are ever as fickle as the wind." When he watched some starving 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   eagerly eat raw venison, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> loftily wrote, "I really did not untill now think that human nature ever presented itself in a shape so nearly allyed to the brute creation." <a href="#n0636" id="ln0636" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a> Some of the American party might have reminded the captain how tasty white pudding or <em class="hi">boudin blanc</em>, made from buffalo intestines, was when prepared by the skillful hands of <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> whole evaluation of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   personality can be seen in one vivid journal entry. Writing on August 19, he declared that "from what has been said of the <span class="tei_name">Shoshones</span> it will be readily perceived that they live in a wretched stait of poverty. Yet notwithstanding their extreem poverty they are not only cheerful but even gay, fond of gaudy dress and amusements; like most other Indians they are great egotists and frequently boast of heroic acts which they never performed. They are also fond of games of wrisk. They are frank, communicative, fair in dealing, generous with the little they possess, extreemly honest, and by no means beggarly." <a href="#n0637" id="ln0637" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were guileless children, fond of dressing up, telling tall tales, and too poor to know they ought to be unhappy without the blessings of civilization.</p>
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> made his catalog of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   culture, there was much he missed or misunderstood. During the long <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> winter, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had heard a good deal about the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , especially from <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> informants. Although the captains understood that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   bands ranged over a wide territory, they did not know the considerable variety and diversity among <span class="tei_name">Shoshonean</span> peoples. Using <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> and other northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   captives as models, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first imagined the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   to be a plains people something like the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands but with a less warlike disposition. In fact, there were two very distinct traditions, two ways that joined to make <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   life.</p>
               <p>
Throughout the long days of searching for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   beyond <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> thought only of horses. But the mounted warrior and hunter was a quite recent development among <span class="tei_name">Shoshoneans</span>. By far the older tradition in northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   life came out of the southern <span class="tei_name">Great Basin</span>, especially <span class="tei_name">Nevada</span> and <span class="tei_name">Utah</span>. Indians of the southern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   lifeway lived in small family groups, were hunter-gatherers, and built wickiup dwellings in a conical shape from brush and grass. Southern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   did not have horses, nor did they focus their lives on a warrior ideal. When <span class="tei_name">Shoshoneans</span> moved into <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> and <span class="tei_name">Idaho</span> some time in the sixteenth century, they carried that <span class="tei_name">Great Basin</span> culture with them. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> people eating fish and living in bruch wickiups, the explorers were witnessing the persistence of old ways.</p>
               <p>
But the northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were more than <em class="hi">ágaideka'a</em>, salmon eaters. In the years after 1700, with the introduction of the horse and contact with plains cultures, there was a revolution in northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   life. That social and cultural upheaval turned pedestrian small-game hunters and fishermen into equestrian hunters of the buffalo and antelope. Changes in social values and organization paralleled the economic ones. After 1700 the northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   developed a culture more like their plains neighbors than their <span class="tei_name">Great Basin</span> relatives. By regional standards, most northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were not the poverty-striken people portrayed by the captains but rather well-to-do, possessing material goods and horses beyond the imagination of most <span class="tei_name">Great Basin</span> peoples. But the acceptance of the horse and some plains nomad traits did not mean that the old ways disappeared. The two traditions were not mutually exclusive. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw a people who scheduled their lives and habits to suit salmon runs west of the divide and buffalo herds east of it. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> provided in his journal entries a survey of the material culture of people whose lives were poised between a <span class="tei_name">Great Basin</span> past and a plains present. Skin tepees and brush lodges, salmon weirs and buffalo hunts all pointed to Indians who had achieved a balance in a difficult land.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
Sandwiched between <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> ethnographic work at <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> difficult reconnaissance of the <span class="tei_name">Salmon River</span> country were two important conferences with <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. Described by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as "a man of Influence Sence &amp; easey &amp; reserved manners, [who] appears to possess a great deal of Cincerity," <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> had proved to be a cooperative and friendly host. <a href="#n0638" id="ln0638" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a> The chief was willing to continue in that role, but he wanted specific things from the expedition in return for his help. And he had no intention of allowing the expedition's desires to thwart the needs of his people. All of this became plain as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> entered <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span> village on August 20. Ushered into the only skin tepee the band still had, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was fed berry cakes and salmon before beginning his talk with the chief. First, the explorer needed geographical information. The future of the expedition now depended on finding a practical route to western waters, whether that path required horses or canoes. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> listened intently to <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> request for directions and then constructed a detailed relief map depicting the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>, <span class="tei_name">Salmon</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot</span> rivers as well as the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Mountains</span>. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> report was both accurate and discouraging. Pressed further by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the chief mentioned for the first time "persed nose Indians" who lived on a river "below the <span class="tei_name">rocky mountains</span> [which] ran a great way toward the setting sun and finally lost itself in a great lake of water which was illy tasted, and where the white men lived."</p>
               <p>
That was just the sort of news <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was looking for, but he was not yet prepared to decide that this northwestern route was the most acceptable. Turning his attention to an old man said by <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> to know much about the lands to the southwest, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> asked him about possible trails to the sea in that direction. What <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> got was an image of barren terrain filled with hostile <span class="tei_name">Bannock Indians</span> and a route that eventually led to the Spanish domain. Promptly rejecting such a path, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> returned to the suggestions offered by <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. The chief indicated that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   hunters made annual treks over the mountains to the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Although <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> insisted that "the road was a very bad one" and lacked game, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> quickly decided that if Indian hunters could make the crossing on short rations his men could do the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> was certainly willing to provide <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with vital geographical information and a guide named <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span>, but in the chief's mind the meeting had a very different purpose. Faced with a food supply that was precarious and enemies who were well armed, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> wanted a serious talk about 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   power, American trade, and plentiful supplies of manufactured goods. Although the <span class="tei_name">Atsinas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> had a ready access to firearms from Canadian traders, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were forced to rely on capturing an occasional gun. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   trade, which centered on Spanish goods obtained either through direct contact or Ute middlemen, did not provide the needed weapons. Spanish borderlands policy sought to keep weapons out of native hands. What Spanish policymakers saw as an effort to protect their borders and restrain Indians from killing each other was perceived by <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> as "leaving them defenceless and an easy prey to their bloodthirsty neighbors to the east." Hunched over the council fire, "his ferce eyes and lank jaws grown meager for want of food," <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> imagined how different 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   destinies would be if he and his warriors had American guns. "We could then live in the country of the buffalo and eat as our enemies do and not be compelled to hide ourselves in these mountains and live on roots and berries as the bear do." Perhaps caught up in the intensity of that vision, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made promises impossible to keep and destined to anger other plains people. The explorer told <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> that the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers had promised to stop raiding the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew that <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war parties had left their villages that very spring, but it was news he was not about to share. Restraining the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> were not possible, nor was it realistic for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to promise that <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> and <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> warriors might accept peace on the plains. Falling back on what was now firm expedition policy, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> promised that "whitemen would come to them with an abundance of guns and every other article necessary to their defence and comfort." All the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   needed to do was provide American traders with fur, and the bounty of Western technology would be theirs. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not realize that by arming the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and making them fur-trade allies, he ensured bitter responses from the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Atsinas</span>. <a href="#n0639" id="ln0639" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Two days later, as <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> reconnaissance of the <span class="tei_name">Salmon River</span> country continued, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, and some fifty 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   men, along with unnumbered women and children, appeared at <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span>. Now it was <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> turn to trade words with the chief. Although the expedition's record for this meeting is not as full as for <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span>, it is plain that <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> once again emphasized his insecure position and its consequences for the band's food supply. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> reply was once again to stress the value of American trade and the possiblities it offered 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   for a better life. Like <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> made <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> a promise of guns. To satisfy more immediate needs, the explorer provided corn, beans, and fish for the hungry band. <a href="#n0640" id="ln0640" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Had he been more observant, the captain might have realized that the demands for food were running counter to the needs of the expedition. At some point <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> would be forced to decide between feeding his people or continuing to provide support for the explorers.</p>
               <p>
On August 24, after some delays, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> finally moved out of <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span>. What seemed to him an essential move must have worried <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. Just how long, he may have wondered, would his band have to wait before leaving for the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> buffalo hunt? That worry grew into a full-scale confrontation with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> the following day. Early in the morning of the 25th, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> quietly sent some of his young warriors across the pass to the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span> camp. These men were to round up the rest of the band, and all would then travel to their eastern hunting grounds. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> was not abandoning the expedition. He was simply responding to a food crisis among his own people. But <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew none of this until late in the afternoon when <span class="tei_name">Toussaint Charbonneau</span> casually mentioned that he soon expected to see all the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   on their way east. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was furious with <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> for withholding vital information, but his real concern was to stop the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   move until the expedition was across the mountains and had the horses it needed. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew he needed to act quickly. Calling <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> and two lesser chiefs to meet with him, the explorer bluntly asked whether they were honorable men whose word could be trusted. He forcefully reminded the chiefs of all their promises to aid the expedition across the divide and on to western waters. Not content to challenge their honor, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> resorted to a direct threat. "If they wished the whitemen to be their friends," he declared, "and to assist them against their enemies by furnishing them with arms and keeping their enemies from attacking them . . . they must never promise us anything which they did not mean to perform." After an awkward silence, the two lesser chiefs claimed that the decision was made by <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span>. Waiting a long time before replying, <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> admitted that his decision had been wrong. The chief explained that he "had been induced to that measure from seeing all his people hungry." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had seen the hunger too and had commented on it repeatedly. <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait's</span> choice had not deserved <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> harsh blast. That the chief finally chose honor over starvation deserved more credit than <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was willing to grant. <a href="#n0641" id="ln0641" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>

The last act in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   encounter was played out at the end of August when the captains were reunited at the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   village on the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi River</span>. Once the explorers decided to follow the advice of <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> and take their chances on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   path over the mountains, there was a flurry of horse trading. Those days of bargaining reveal how quickly the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   learned to deal with the expedition as a captive market. In the earliest days of the encounter, the Indians were so fascinated with the explorers and their manufactured goods that they were willing to exchange a horse for an old checked shirt, a pair of worn leggings, and a knife. "The Indians," wrote <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "seemed quite as well pleased with their bargain as I was." <a href="#n0642" id="ln0642" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> But 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   traders soon learned that they could get much more if they bargained more sharply. On the day <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> moved out of <span class="tei_name">Camp Fortunate</span> he noticed some spare horses. Offering to trade for them, the explorer was bluntly told to display his wares before business could begin. Ragged clothing and mirrors were plainly not sufficient to attract the attention of the Indians. Digging deep into his store of trade goods, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> came up with objects that had been the staple of exchange at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Those iron war axes that had so pleased village warriors had a similar effect on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . With the rate of exchange for horses now changing, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was compelled to offer a battle-axe, a knife, a handkerchief, and some paint for one horse. For a Spanish mule, valued for its surefootedness, the American had to add another knife and some clothing. <a href="#n0643" id="ln0643" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Once over <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span> and at the Indian village, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> began serious trading. On August 23, the first day of bargaining, it was plain that the free and easy days of cheap horses were long gone. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was forced to pay increasingly larger amounts of merchandise for each horse. He had no choice but to accept the Indians' demands. On the second trading lay, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> bought five or six more mounts and paid a considerable price for each one. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> joined <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> on August 29, he had to offer his pistol, a knife, and one hundred rounds of ammunition for one horse. Offering guns for horses was a sure indication of both the expedition's need and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  ' trading skill. Despite their best efforts, the captains did not prove to be especially astute traders. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> carefully examined the twenty-nine horses in the expedition's corral, he found them to be "nearly all sore backs, and several pore, and young." <a href="#n0644" id="ln0644" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had paid dearly for castoffs of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   herd. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   had proven to be better Yankee traders than the Americans.</p>

            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
Led now by <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span>, the expedition struggled along the north fork of the <span class="tei_name">Salmon River</span> through country made difficult by heavy timber, steep hills, and dense thickets. Progress was slowed as horses slipped and fell. A snow and sleet storm made the going even more treacherous. The explorers had heard about the Flathead Indians during the winter with the Mandans. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   had indicated that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   might be met as the expedition moved north, but since the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   regularly joined 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   bands for hunting across the mountains at this season, a meeting this late in the year seemed unlikely. Nevertheless, on September 4, as the expedition crossed <span class="tei_name">Lost Trail Pass</span> and entered the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Valley</span>, the Americans encountered a large 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   Indian camp in a place known later as <span class="tei_name">Ross's Hole</span>.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> progress toward the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   camp had not gone unnoticed. Early that morning and old chief named <span class="tei_name">Three Eagles</span> had grown concerned about possible raiding parties who might steal the band's horses. Out scouting during the day, <span class="tei_name">Three Eagles</span> was the first to see the expedition. Hiding in the brush, he was both bewildered and concerned by the sight. Here were men and horses moving along without any effort to conceal their presence. Seeing that they had no blankets, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   assumed they were a group of travelers who had been robbed by hostile Indians. Uncertain of the strangers' intention, he hurried back to camp to warn his people.</p>
               <p>
Still apprehensive about the strangers, <span class="tei_name">Three Eagles</span> returned to a stand of timber where he could watch without being seen. As the Americans drew closer, <span class="tei_name">Three Eagles</span> caught sight of <span class="tei_name">York</span>, whose face, he supposed, was painted black in preparation for war. The Indian assumed that the expedition must have recently emerged from a battle in which they had lost only their blankets. Now convinced that the strangers would soon come upon the Indian camp, <span class="tei_name">Three Eagles</span> once again returned to spread the warning. Because the expedition did not act like a war party, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   chiefs decided to remain quiet and wait for the strangers to arrive in the valley. <a href="#n0645" id="ln0645" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Throughout the day the expedition had seen fresh signs indicating that Indians were nearby. Toward evening the party entered <span class="tei_name">Ross's Hole</span> and saw thirty-three lodges dotting the valley floor. Already convinced that the Americans were not a war party, the Indians greeted <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> with a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   version of the "national hug" employed by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  . While the captains were ceremoniously conducted to 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   tepees, the rest of the expedition was offered what little food could be found. Because it was late, serious talk had to be postponed until the following day.</p>
               <p>
Those Indians whom <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and their men insisted on calling the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   were, in fact, Salish-speaking people. They later told the captains that they were <span class="tei_name">Ootlashoots of the Tushepaw</span> nation. "Ootlashoot" was probably from the Salish word for red willow, the native name for the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot River</span>. The name 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   proved to be a source of endless confusion from its first appearance in the expedition's records. The <span class="tei_name">Salish</span> seen by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not practice head flattening, a fact quickly pointed out by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> in conversation with <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span>. The captains first heard about the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   while at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> 1805 map places them approximately where they were found in September 1805. The name 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   appears to have been the result of interpreting the visual sign language gesture for the <span class="tei_name">Salish</span>. They were signed by pressing both sides of the head with the hands in a flattening motion.</p>
               <p>
Much of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   life was like the cycle of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   year. The <span class="tei_name">Ootlashoots</span> maintained close ties with the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   and joined them each year for the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> buffalo hunt. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   culture was an adoptive way of life. By the time the captains came to <span class="tei_name">Ross's Hole</span>, these <span class="tei_name">Salish</span> speakers had created a lifeway that blended their plateau past with many plains traits. After 1700, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   life became increasingly dominated by horse and buffalo patterns. Perhaps the most significant difference between the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   and their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   neighbors was language. Both <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> noted the difference on the first night in the valley. For <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Salish</span> speakers sounded as if they were lisping or had "a bur on their tongue." The sergeant speculated that this odd way of speaking meant the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   were really the long lost Welsh Indians! Without knowing it, the expedition had passed from the Uto-Aztecan language family, to which 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   belonged, to the <span class="tei_name">Salish</span> family. What <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> graphically described as "a gugling kind of language spoken much thro the throat" was in fact Salish. <a href="#n0646" id="ln0646" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not intend to spend much time among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                  . The Indians were in a hurry to join their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   hunting partners and the expedition was anxious to make their mountain passage. Thursday, September 5, was a busy day filled with talk and trade, both of which were made difficult by translation problems. Neither <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> nor <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> spoke Salish. As luck would have it, among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   was a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   boy who had been taken captive by some northern raiding party, was later freed by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                  , and now lived with them. Using the boy's language skills, the captains constructed a translation chain that required each word to pass through the captains' English, <span class="tei_name">Labiche's</span> French, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , and on to the boy's Salish. By this cumbersom means, the explorers briefly explained their mission, awarded several medals and flags, and generally made friends. But the real business of the day was horse swapping. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   generously took a number of worn-out horses in exchange for some of their healthy and "ellegant" ones. Twelve good mounts were added to the expedition's herd. During the day <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took time to note 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   hair and clothing styles, observing that they were quite similar to 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   fashions. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> probably spoke for many when he found the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   to be "the likelyest and honestst Savages we have ever yet Seen." <a href="#n0647" id="ln0647" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The following day the expedition did some more horse dealing, adding two fine animals to the herd. Meanwhile, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> struggled to draft a Salish vocabulary. According to <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span>, many believed such a vocabulary would prove once and for all time whether these Indians were descendants of Prince Madoc and the Welsh Indians. Here so many miles from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> were echoes still of that persistent myth which had the power to capture the imaginations of men as different as <span class="tei_name">John Evans</span> and <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>. Working in a steady drizzle, the expedition's horse handlers hurried to lighten loads and tighten packsaddle cinches. At mid-afternoon, as the rain let up, a memorable cavalcade marched out of <span class="tei_name">Ross's Hole</span>. The expedition pressed on north while the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   galloped out for <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> and the buffalo hunt. <a href="#n0648" id="ln0648" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a>

The next three weeks held some of the most demanding and dangerous days in the history of the Corps of Discovery. After spending a brief time at <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span>, the explorers turned west to hazard the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> across the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Mountains</span>. Talks with <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> had prepared <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> for a difficult crossing. But information from two Flatheads met near <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span> had taken the sting out of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  ' warnings. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   insisted that the trail took only five days and would bring the expedition directly to Indians who were 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   relatives. Heartened by those words, the explorers marched out to cross what <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> called "the most terrible mountains I ever beheld." <a href="#n0649" id="ln0649" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
From the beginning, the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> proved a cruel and unforgiving passage. A clearly marked, well-traveled trail at the outset, it soon became a faint trace often lost in a tangle of fallen timber and dense thickets. Serious trouble struck on September 14 when <span class="tei_name">Old Toby's</span> memory failed and he led the party off the main track, down a fishing path, and to the <span class="tei_name">Lochsa River</span>. On short rations already, the expedition killed one of their horses and remembered how lost and hungry they were by naming a nearby stream <span class="tei_name">Killed Colt Creek</span>. In order to rejoin the trail, the explorers had to make a painful climb up the side of <span class="tei_name">Wendover Ridge</span>. Horses slipped and fell, rolling down in tangles of brush and broken equipment. For hungry and bone-tired explorers, the <span class="tei_name">Lolo</span> was already coming to symbolize the kind of physical challenge they had not experienced since the days at the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> portage and on the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead River</span>.</p>
               <p>
Monday, September 16, was perhaps the grimmest day in the expedition's memory. Sleeping on any level places they could find, the explorers awoke to find themselves covered with a heavy blanket of snow. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> caught the general mood that morning as he watched men without stockings fumble in the cold to wrap rags around already numb feet. Gasping for breath in the thin air, the expedition marched thirteen painful miles "with grat dificulty." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, never one to complain in the face of adversity, admitted, "I have [never] been [as] wet and as cold in every part . . . in my life." With no end in sight, there would be another night sleeping in the snow and struggling to survive on meager rations.</p>
               <p>
By the night of September 17, it was plain that drastic measures had to be taken. The expedition was nearing the limits of its physical endurance. Believing that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   territories were just ahead, the captains decided that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would press ahead with a small band of hunters while <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> worked to bring along the main group. On the morning of September 18, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men set out toward a broad valley they could see in the distance. Ahead lay two more days of difficult going. Rescue from the bitter snows was now at hand, but few would forget what <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> called "this horrible mountainous desert." <a href="#n0650" id="ln0650" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Sometime on September 20, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his hunters at last escaped the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> and broke out on a small upland plain known afterward as <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span>. Long a gathering place for 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   families to dig and cook camas roots and fish in the nearby <span class="tei_name">Clearwater River</span>, the prairie was filled with signs of Indian activity. Riding some three miles through the plain, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men could see many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   lodges in the distance. When the Americans were within a mile of the first cluster of lodges, they suddenly came upon three young Indians. Seeing the strangers and fearing a raid, the boys scattered and hid in the high prairie grass. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> worried lest they alarm the village and make the first expedition-
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   meeting a troubled one. He quickly dismounted, handed his gun to one of the hunters, and began to search the tall grass. That hasty search turned up two very frightened boys. To quiet their fears, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gave each one several small pieces of ribbon and then urged them with gestures to announce the arrival of friendly visitors in their village.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party waited nervously as the boys hurried away. A short time later, one man emerged from the village and walked cautiously toward the explorers. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   used signs to invite the Americans into a large tepee. He explained that the lodge belonged to the band's chief <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span>, now absent on a raid. Most of the men in the band were with the chief and would not return for two weeks. By now <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his men were surrounded by a few elderly men and many women, all eager to see the bearded strangers. Although the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   had heard about white men, only a handful had ever seen them. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sensed that curious 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   eyes betrayed both fear and genuine pleasure. Why they might have been pleased to greet the Corps of Discovery did not become clear until later. But now food was the order of the day and pieces of buffalo, dried salmon, and camas bread were passed around. Not knowing the consequences of that diet, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the others ate the camas with unthinking abandon. After handing out a few small gifts, the captain moved on to the second 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   camp.</p>
               <p>
At the second camp, a cluster of fifteen lodges, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finally had time to take note of the Indians around him. Although 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   dress and ways seemed similar to what he had seen at <span class="tei_name">Ross's Hole</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ears told him that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   language was quite different from the Salish spoken by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                  . Without knowing it, the explorers had crossed an important linguistic boundary and were now in the territory of Sahaptian speakers. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded that these Indians called themselves "<span class="tei_name">Chopunnish or Pierced noses</span>." <span class="tei_name">Chopunnish</span> may have been <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> fractured effort to spell "Sahaptian," the Salish word used by 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                   and their neighbors to describe the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   as "those who lived to the south." <a href="#n0651" id="ln0651" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Looking at 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   men, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found them large and "portly" while the women appeared small and "handsome featured." With an eye toward future trade, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   bead-color preferences (blue and white) and the ornamental uses for brass and copper. Perhaps remembering how good camas bread tasted, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took time to record the method Indian women used to steam the roots and prepare the bread. Later in the evening the explorer began to regret his healthy appetite. As it would for days, the root bread produced diarrhea and painful intestinal gas. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have made a mental note to warn <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> not to eat the bread! <a href="#n0652" id="ln0652" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the following day, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dispatched hunters to find something to vary the camas and fish diet while he stayed with his 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   host. The captain hoped to settle any Indian fears about the expedition's intentions and obtain much needed information about the route ahead. Anxious to help, a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   chief drew a hasty chart of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> and <span class="tei_name">Snake</span> rivers. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was told about the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Columbia</span> and also led to believe that whites lived at the falls, where the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   obtained beads and metal goods. Although the Indians did trade for beads, copper, and brass at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> and <span class="tei_name">Celilo Falls</span>, there were, in fact, no white traders in the territory so jealously guarded by <span class="tei_name">Wishram and Wasco Indian</span> middlemen. Probably a misinterpretation of sign language was to blame here. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> asked for additional information, he was told that a more important chief named <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> was at a fishing camp farther up the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span>. After purchasing some extra provisions and sending <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span> back toward the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> to locate <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, he made his way to <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair's</span> camp.</p>
               <p>
Traveling over unfamiliar ground without an Indian guide, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> became lost in the darkness. Fortunately, he stumbled on a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   man who was willing for the price of one handkerchief to direct the explorer toward <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair's</span> camp. It was close to midnight when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finally reached the fishing camp. <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span>, properly known as <span class="tei_name">Walammottinin</span>, meaning "hair or forelock bunched and tied," was about sixty-five years old, "a Cheerful man with apparant siencerity." <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> first meeting with <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> was cordial, and both men smoked together well into the night.</p>
               <p>
Among the women and children at <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair's</span> camp was an elderly woman named <span class="tei_name">Watkuweis</span>. In the first draft of his journal for that day, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took note of her presence, explaining that she "had formerly been taken by the Minitarries of the North &amp; seen white men." Her name did not appear in his revised journal entry. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not know how important the old woman had been in insuring a friendly reception for the expedition. <span class="tei_name">Watkuweis</span>, whose name meant "returned from a far country," had been captured by <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> or <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> raiders sometime late in the eighteenth century. Taken into <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>, she had been purchased by a trader and had lived for several years among whites before finding her way home. <span class="tei_name">Watkuweis</span> had been treated well and had never lost her favorable impression of whites. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came to <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair's</span> camp, <span class="tei_name">Watkuweis</span> urged her people to treat the expedition with all hospitality. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   oral tradition records that when <span class="tei_name">Watkuweis</span> heard of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> arrival, she said, "These are the people who helped me. Do them no hurt." <a href="#n0653" id="ln0653" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   welcome was based on more than the word of a former captive. Like their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   neighbors, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   bands were desperate to obtain guns and ammunition. As weapons from Canadian traders fell into <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> and <span class="tei_name">Atsina</span> hands, Indians without firearms found their situation increasingly precarious. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   buffalo hunters were threatened, and undefended villages were at risk. Faced with an urgent need to find guns, three warriors from <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm's</span> band had joined 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                   traders in a journey to the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns. That trip, made in the spring of 1805, brought the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   their first six guns as well as news of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. More than anything else, it was the need for guns that conditioned the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  ' behavior toward the expedition. The desire for trade and the words of <span class="tei_name">Watkuweis</span> made the expedition's first encounter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   a friendly one. <a href="#n0654" id="ln0654" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
September 22 was the day of grand reunion for the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> parties. While <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> spent most of the morning with <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and his son, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his contingent traveled the last few painful miles along the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span>. Early in the afternoon, the main party came off the trail and was met by <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span>. At about five o'clock, <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> group reached the first <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span> village. When all the Indian women hurried to gather their children and flee on horseback into the woods, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was plainly worried since <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was supposed to have prepared the Indians for his arrival. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> feared that moving the women and children out of range now was the first step in a hostile action. But his fears were stemmed when several unarmed men emerged from the village carrying gifts of camas bread for the expedition.</p>
               <p>
Just at sunset, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> walked up to the first 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   village to find the main party "much fatigued and hungry." Recalling his own unpleasant experience with the camas bread and fish diet, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "cautioned them of the consequences of eating too much." In the twilight, <span class="tei_name">Weippe Prairie</span> was covered with inquisitive 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , all anxious to catch a glimpse of the strangers and their fascinating equipment. That fascination was evidently too much for some 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   because later <span class="tei_name">Reuben Field</span> discovered his knife, compass, fire steel, and gun wiping rod were missing. Ready to overlook minor pilfering, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were intent on obtaining accurate geographical information from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . But communication was difficult since neither <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> nor <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> could speak 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                  . Although forced to rely on sign language, the captains managed to obtain valuable data about the way ahead. <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> took a whitened elk skin and drew an accurate map of the rivers that would take the expedition to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. The chief claimed a bit optimistically that five days of travel would take the Americans to the <span class="tei_name">Falls of the Columbia</span> and places where white traders lived. Always the cautious cartographer, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> finished the evening gathering "maps of the Country &amp; river with the Situation of Indians, Towns from Several men of note Seperately which varied verry little." <a href="#n0655" id="ln0655" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not intend to remain long among the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  , no matter how friendly they were. With the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> waters so close, the explorers were anxious to find winter quarters somewhere along the coast. The expedition's most immediate needs were to replenish food supplies and exchange horses for canoes. There might be time for some ritual diplomacy, but linguistic and ethnographic studies would have to wait until the return trip. On September 23, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called a council at the first 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   village. Although <span class="tei_name">Broken Arm</span> was still absent on a raid, other chiefs joined <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> in listening to the captains recite the usual formulas of United States Indian policy. But efforts to inform the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   chiefs of American intentions were hampered by translation problems and once again all relied on <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> signs. With serious diplomacy cut to a minimum, gifts of tobacco, clothing, flags, and medals had to convey the expedition's message. Just what <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and his fellow chiefs gathered from the conference remains unclear, but <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> claimed that the gifts and American policies "appeared to satisfy them much." Determined to cultivate friendship with the Americans, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   diplomats might have been more satisfied with direct talk about guns.</p>
               <p>
While the diplomats were occupied in exchanging gestures and gifts, most of the expedition was busy trading for food and getting to know their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   neighbors. <span class="tei_name">John Ordway's</span> usual eye for telling details did not fail him as he caught sight of copper kettles and other metal goods obtained from middle <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> traders. The sergeant also noticed something that indicated the adoptive nature of so many plateau peoples: among the plains-style skin tepees were reed or "flag" lodges reminiscent of those seen in 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   country. But ethnography was not the order of the day. Trade for camas, dried fish, and berries was far more important, and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   were eager to barter for precious cloth and metal. Blue beads were the most sought-after commodity, but <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> saw real Indian interest in "a small piece of red cloth, as wide as a mans hand." Although <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> later complained that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   were "very selfish and stingey," both peoples appeared pleased with their trade bargains. <a href="#n0656" id="ln0656" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> planned to brand their horses, leave them with the Indians, and begin canoe building as quickly as possible. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   were no hindrance to that plan, but their food was. In the evening after the conference, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and two men began to suffer from severe gastrointestinal distress. Whether it was the change in diet or bacteria in the food is not clear, but the consequences were serious. Constant debilitating diarrhea and gas pains sometimes so pressing as to make breathing difficult afflicted others in the expedition. On September 24, when the captains wanted to get closer to the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater River</span>, many men were sick and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> himself was "scarcely able to ride on a jentle horse." Explorers who had weathered the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> portage and the <span class="tei_name">Lolo Trail</span> were now lying along the path doubled over with pain and too weak to walk. <a href="#n0657" id="ln0657" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a> Despite the fact that he was still unwell, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> joined <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and two of his sons in searching for good canoe timber and a boat-building site close to the river. The place they found was a narrow pine bottom on the south side of the river, opposite the junction of the north fork of the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater</span> and the main stem.</p>
               <p>
Despite widespread illness, the expedition made their canoe-building camp on September 26 and began to work. It quickly became apparent that the small axes <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> distributed were simply inadequate for the task. Not enough able workers and the wrong tools made progress slow. Looking to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   for help, the expedition followed Indian practice in making dugout canoes by burning the centers of the logs. Even with that labor-saving technique, it took the Americans ten days to construct five canoes. If 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   technology made the construction possible, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   skill of another sort was to be available for the journey on to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and a younger chief named <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span> had promised to accompany the expedition and serve as intermediaries between the explorers and the Sahaptian-speaking peoples. <a href="#n0658" id="ln0658" class="ref_link"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Toward midafternoon on October 7, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition was at last prepared to begin the final leg of its journey to the western sea. With canoes loaded, balanced, and in the water, all seemed ready to seek the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and a saltwater tide. Disappointed that the two 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   chiefs had not yet appeared, the captains decided that they could wait no longer. It was not until the next day that <span class="tei_name">Twisted Hair</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tetoharsky</span> joined the expedition. No sooner had the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   guides appeared than Old Toby and his son left. Deciding that their term of enlistment was complete, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   were last seen running along the river bank, having neither announced their departure nor waited to be paid. Just why <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> fled is not clear, although <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> believed that a canoe accident in dangerous rapids earlier in the day frightened the Indian. <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> may have been equally concerned about traveling farther among unknown and potentially hostile tribes. <a href="#n0659" id="ln0659" class="ref_link"><sup>[59]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the night that <span class="tei_name">Old Toby</span> slipped away, the expedition and its Indian contingent stopped to make camp along the <span class="tei_name">Clearwater River</span>. Feeling stronger now and filled with the expectation that their canoes would soon ride in saltwater, the explorers were ready to celebrate. Gathered around blazing fires, they joined hands with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                   and "were very merry." The whine of <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte's</span> fiddle and the shouts of dancing men cut the chilly air. Frenchmen like <span class="tei_name">Labiche</span> and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> enjoyed roasted dog while others picked at salmon and camas staples. But the night suddenly became stranger when a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   woman was seized by an apparent fit. Shouting and singing, she attempted to give gifts of camas roots and brass bracelets to one of the startled Americans. When the gifts were refused, the woman angrily cut her arms with sharp flint. What <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> recorded as a seizure was perhaps the woman's <em class="hi">Wyakin</em> or guardian spirit at work.

The information was given to Farnham by a <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span> who claimed to have been the man seen by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> on August 11.
