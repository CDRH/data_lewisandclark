Not any occurrence today worthy of notice.    we live sumptuously on our wappetoe and Sturgeon.    the Anchovey is so delicate that they soon become tainted unless pickled or smoked.    the natives run a small stick through their gills and hang them in the smoke of their lodges, or kindle a small fire under them for the purpose of drying them.    they need no previous preperation of guting &amp;c and will cure in 24 hours.    the natives do not appear to be very scrupelous about eating them when a little feated.— <a href="#n28030401" id="ln28030401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    the fresh sturgeon they keep for many days by immersing it in water.    they coock their sturgeon by means of vapor or steam.    the process is as follows.    a brisk fire is kindled on which a parcel of stones are lad.    when the fire birns down and the stones are sufficiently heated, the stones are so arranged as to form a tolerable level surface, the sturgeon which had been previously cut into large fletches is now laid on the hot stones; a parsel of small boughs of bushes is next laid on and a second course of the sturgeon thus repating alternate layers of sturgeon and boughs untill the whole is put on which they design to cook.    it is next covered closely with matts and water is poared in such manner as to run in among the hot stones and the vapor arrising being confined by the mats, cooks the fish.    the whole process is performed in an hour, and the sturgeon thus cooked is much better than either boiled or roasted.</p>

the fresh sturgeon they Keep maney days by immersing it in water. they Cook their Sturgeon by means of vapor or Steam.    the process is as follows.    a brisk fire is kindled on which a parcel of Stones are Sufficiently heated, the Stones are So arranged as to form a tolerable leavel Surface, the Sturgeon which had been previously cut into large flaetches is now laid on the hot Stones; a parcel of Small boughs of bushes is next laid on, and a Second course of the Sturgeon thus repeating alternate layers of Sturgeon &amp; boughs untill the whole is put on which they design to Cook.    it is next covered closely with mats and water is poared in Such manner as to run in among the hot Stones, and the vapor arriseing being confind by the mats, cooks the fish.    the whole process is performd in an hour and the Sturgeon thus Cooked is much better than either boiled or roasted.    in their usial way of boiting of other fish in baskets with hot Stones is not so good.</p>
