Set out early this morning as usual current strong with frequent riffles; employ the cord and seting poles.    the oars scarcely ever being used except to pass the river in order to take advantage of the shore and current.      at the distance of 3¾ m. passed the entrance of a large Creek 15 yds. wide which discharges itself on Lard. near the center of a Lard. bend it is a bold runing stream    this we called <a class="regularization" title="Sixteenmile (Howard's) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Sixteenmile%20%28Howard%27s%29%20Creek">Howard's Creek</a> after <a class="regularization" title="Howard, Thomas P." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Howard%2C%20Thomas%20P.">Thomas P.
