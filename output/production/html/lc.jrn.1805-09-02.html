and stones that injured our horses feet, they being without shoes. In the forenoon we killed some pheasants <a href="#n22090206" id="ln22090206" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and ducks, and a small squirrel. In the afternoon we had a good deal of rain, and the worst road (if road it can be called) that was ever travelled. The creek is become small and the hills come close in upon the banks of it, covered thick with standing timber and fallen trees; so that in some places we were obliged to go up the sides of the hills, which are very steep, and then down again in order to get along at all. In going up these ascents the horses would sometimes fall backwards, which injured them very much; and one was so badly hurt that the driver was obliged to leave his load on the side of one of the hills. In the low ground there are most beautiful tall straight pine trees of different kinds, except of white pine. <a href="#n22090207" id="ln22090207" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Game is scarce; and a small quantity of dried salmon, which we got from the natives is almost our whole stock of provisions.

Monday September 2nd    A cloudy wet morning, We set out with our horses &amp; proceeded on our Journey, and about 7 o'Clock A. M. we passed some very bad Roads, some being plains with very thick bushes, and low slashes to cross, other places, very rockey, we went a North east course up the Creek above mention'd.    We recrossed the same Creek near a large spring run,—    where we saw a number of high beaver dams.    We saw also Pitch pine &amp; Balsam fir Trees in great abundance, on the Tops of the Mountains, We passed through a bad thicket of tall strait Pitch pine, balsam fir, &amp; Cotton wood Timber 〈so〉 which grew so close to each other that we were obliged to cut a road for our horses to pass through.—</p>
               <p>
Some of those places were very steep &amp; Rockey.—    We continued our course up the side of the Creek already mentioned this day, and crossed a number of fine Spring branches, and waided in the Creek a number of times.    The Mountains that lies on both sides of this Creek are very steep &amp; high; the bottoms on this Creek narrow &amp; swampey, And had a vast number of beaver dams, on them    We named this place <a class="regularization" title="Dismal Swamp" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dismal%20Swamp">Dismal swamp</a>, &amp; it was certainly a lonesome rough looking part of the Country.—    We were obliged to Climb several hills with our horses, where the hills was so steep &amp; rockey, 〈which〉 some of the horses that was weak &amp; had sore feet fell backward with their loads; and rolled down to the foot of those hills, we were obliged to carry the loads of our horses, on our backs up many of the hills, &amp; then load them again.    One of our horses gave out, so that we were obliged to leave his load.—    We came about 13 Miles this day, &amp; encamped in a thicket of pine trees, and balsam fir timber; near the Creek.—    Two of our Men came up with their horses &amp; loads after it was dark.—    We came about 
6 Miles through this bad road, all of which way was very bad travelling, and we are informed by our guide, that we have still further to go, before we get to the plains, which he says will be tomorrow, Our Hunters killed several Pheasants this day, but saw no other kind of Game.—
