Collected the 4 horses purchased yesterday and Sent <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazier</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Charbonneau, Toussaint" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Charbonneau%2C%20Toussaint">Shabono</a> with them to the bason where I expected they would meet <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Cap L—s</a> and Commence the portage of the baggage on those horses.    about 10 A.

M. I payed but little attention to this bargain however Suffered the bundles to lye. I dressed the Sores of the principal Chief gave Some Small things to his children and promised the Chief Some Medicine for to Cure his Sores.    his wife who I found to be a Sulky Bitch and was Somewhat efflicted with pains in her back.    this I thought a good oppertunity to get her on my Side giveing here Something for her back.
