Wednesday October 16th    A pleasant morning &amp; we set out early; and proceeded on; we passed over several bad Rapids, which lay quite across the River, which were 〈was〉 full of rocks.    One of our Canoes struck on a rock, which was in a rapid, &amp; swung round and remained fast, where she staid, till the Canoe that I was in came to their assistance &amp; a small Canoe belonging to our party.    The Men from the two Canoes got the load out of the Canoe, 
&amp; got her off the rock &amp; to the shore.    We got the Canoes loaded again &amp; continued on our Voyage.    we passed over several more bad Rapids; and came to a place in the River, where we found a very bad Rapid by far the 
worst that we had yet seen on this River; &amp; we halted our Canoes above the Rapid.    We carried a considerable quantity of our baggage about a Mile by land below this rapid.—    We got all our canoes safe over this 〈rapid〉 difficult place &amp; loaded them and proceeded on down the River; &amp; passed several more Rapids.—    Towards evening we arrived at a large fork that came into this River from a Northerly direction &amp; was much large than the fork which we descended which we supposed to be the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>.—    The country round where the forks of these two Rivers lay 〈is〉 was level &amp; 〈is〉 smooth barren plains, with not a Tree to be seen as far as our Eyes could extend.    Along the Shores 〈are〉 grew a few Willows.    We found upwards of 200 Indians, that were encamped on a point of land, that lay between these two Rivers, in a very pleasant situated place.    We Encamped near those Indians on the same point of land.    These natives came to our encampment &amp; sold us 8 dogs &amp; some fresh Salmon.    This whole Band of Indians came in a body, Singing in their manner to our fires, Smoaked with us, &amp; appeared friendly.—    These Indians had beads, and small pieces of brass &amp; Copper hanging about them, which they made signs to us, that they got them from White people, who live on a River; lying to the North of this place, &amp; that they also got some of them at the Mouth of this River.    We passed several Islands this day &amp; came 26 Miles, the Course with us is the same as Yesterday.—

The information he obtained from the Indians respecting this river before he left the <a class="regularization" title="Peace River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Peace%20River">Unjigah</a> was, 'that it was a large river and ran towards the mid-day sun; but did not empty itself into the sea.' This opinion of these natives at a distance, with respect to its not emptying itself into the sea, must have arisen chiefly from what they had heard of its course, which is east of south and nearly parallel to the coast of <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">the Pacific</a>, and of the great distance it continued to run in that direction.

He represented the carrying places as of great length, and passing over hills and mountains. He depicted the lands of three other tribes in succession who spoke different languages. Beyond them he knew nothing of the river or country, only that it was still a long way to the sea; and that, as he had heard, there was a lake before they reached the water, which the natives did not drink. 'The more I heard of the river,' says <a class="regularization" title="McKenzie, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKenzie%2C%20Charles">Mr. McKenzie</a>, 'the more I was convinced it could not empty itself into the ocean to the north of what is called the river of the West, so that with its windings the distance must be very great.' It is not improbable that the distance by water, from the place <a class="regularization" title="McKenzie, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKenzie%2C%20Charles">Mr. McKenzie</a> struck this river, to its mouth (supposing it to be the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>, Oregan or Great river of the West) is upwards of 1000 miles, and its whole course from its source 1500. By the lake mentioned by the Indian chief is no doubt meant the bay at the mouth of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a>, and wide part of the river where the tide water ascends and renders the whole unfit to drink."
<p>The notion of a Great River of the West as a necessary part of a water route across the continent developed well before the actual discovery of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> in 1792.
