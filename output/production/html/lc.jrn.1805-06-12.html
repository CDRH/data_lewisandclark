This morning I felt myself quite revived, took another portion of my decoction and set out at sunrise. I now boar out from the river in order to avoid the steep ravines of the river which usually make out in the plain to the distance of one or two miles; after gaining the leavel plain my couse was a litte to the West of S. W.—    having traveled about 12 miles by 9 in the morning, the sun became warm, and I boar a little to the south in order to gain the river as well to obtain water to allay my thirst as to kill something for breakfast; for the plain through which we had been passing possesses no water and is so level that we cannot approach the buffaloe within shot before they discover us and take to flight.    we arrived at the river about 10 A. M. having traveled about 15 m.    at this place there is a handsom open bottom with some cottonwood timber, here we met
with two large bear, and killed them boath at the first fire, a circumstance which I beleive has never happend with the party in killing the brown bear before.    we dressed the bear, breakfasted on a part of one of them and hung the meat and skins on the trees out of the reach of the wolves. I left a note on a stick near the river for <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a>, informing him of my progress &amp;c.—    after refreshing ourselves abut 2 hours we again ascended the bluffs and gained the high plain; saw a great number of burrowing squirrels in the plains today.    also wolves Antelopes mule deer and immence herds of buffaloe.    we passed a ridge of land considerably higher than the adjacent plain on either side, from this hight we had a most beatifull and picturesk view of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky mountains</a> which wer perfectly covered with Snow and reaching from S. E. to the N. of N. W.—    they appear to be formed of several ranges each succeeding range rising higher than the preceding one untill the most distant appear to loose their snowey tops in the clouds; <a href="#n15061201" id="ln15061201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> this was an august spectacle and still rendered more formidable by the recollection that we had them to pass.    we traveled about twelve miles when we agin struck the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missoury</a> at a handsome little bottom of Cottonwood timber and altho' the sun had not yet set I felt myself somewhat w[e]ary being weakened I presume by late disorder; and therfore determined to remain here during the ballance of the day and night, having marched about 27 miles today. <a href="#n15061202" id="ln15061202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    on our way in the evening we had killed a buffaloe, an Antelope and three mule deer, and taken a sufficient quantity of the best of the flesh of these anamals for three meals, which we had brought with us. This evening I ate very heartily and after pening the transactions of the day amused myself catching those white fish mentioned yesterday; they are here in great abundance    I
caught upwards of a douzen in a few minutes; they bit most freely at the melt of a deer <a href="#n15061203" id="ln15061203" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> which <a class="regularization" title="Goodrich, Silas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Goodrich%2C%20Silas">goodrich</a> had brought with him for the purpose of fishing.</p>
               <p>
The narrow leafed cottonwood grows here in common with the other species of the same tree with a broad leaf or that which has constituted the major part of the timber of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> from it's junction with the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> to this place. The narrow leafed cottonwood differs only from the other in the shape of it's leaf and greater thickness of it's bark.    the leaf is a long oval acutely pointed, about 2½ or 3 Inches long and from ¾ to an inch in width; it is thick, sometimes slightly grooved or channeled; margin slightly serrate; the upper disk of a common green while the under disk is of a whiteish green; the leaf is smoth. <a href="#n15061204" id="ln15061204" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the beaver appear to be extremely fond of this tree and even seem to scelect it from among the other species of Cottonwood, probably from it's affording a deeper and softer bark than the other species.—    saw some sign of the Otter as well as beaver near our camp, also a great number of tracks of the brown bear; these fellows leave a formidable impression in the mud or sand    I measured one this evening which was eleven inches long exclusive of the tallons and seven and ¼ in width.—</p>
