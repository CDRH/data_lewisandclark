The <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> encounter had no quick ending and escaping its tangles proved no easy task. When the expedition resumed its progress up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> on September 29, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> was on board the keelboat while the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> was waiting in the wings. Standing on a sandbar, the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> and two of his warriors demanded transportation as far as the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages. When the captains refused, <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> suggested that a carrot or two of tobacco and a ferry ride from one bank to the other might placate the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wearily complied, hoping this would be the last <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> request.</p>
               <p>
The expedition's attention was now turned to the first signs of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. At the mouth of <span class="tei_name">No Timber Creek</span>, known today as <span class="tei_name">Chantier Creek</span>, the Americans found an abandoned <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> settlement. Described by <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> in the mid-1790s the village had been occupied until the end of the century. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote that nothing remained of the village "but the mound which surrounds the town." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, who always had an eye for simple but revealing detail, noted remains of cornfields in rich bottomland around the empty village. <a href="#n0301" id="ln0301" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In subsequent days the expedition would see more abandoned towns, all mute testimony to the many years of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> migration along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>.</p>
               <p>
On the following day, September 30, some of the last scenes in the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> drama were played out. With <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> still on board, the explorers brought their flotilla to a sandbar opposite a 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   encampment. As the men ate breakfast, the captains talked with several warriors. The Indians were told about the "bad treatment" the expedition had suffered at the hands of the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands lower down the river and were warned not to try the same. Those brave words were carefully matched by a generous amount of tobacco, and the American party moved on without incident. In the afternoon the wind picked up and the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> suddenly became a choppy lake. Rocking dangerously, the keelboat seemed ready to founder. <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span>, fearing for his life, pleaded to be put ashore. Perhaps relieved to be free of their Indian passenger, the captains gave the chief some gifts and "advised him to keep his men away." <a href="#n0302" id="ln0302" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In early October, as the weather turned cold and windy, the expedition encountered even more traces of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. On the first of the month, they found another abandoned townsite, a fortified island settlement of substantial size. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described the ruins as "only a mound circular walls 3 or 4 feet high." <a href="#n0303" id="ln0303" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found more than <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> remains around the <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span>; they also found <span class="tei_name">Jean Vallé</span>, an independent trader. The Frenchman was engaged in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   trade and had a small supply of goods for that purpose. <span class="tei_name">Vallé</span> gave the captains an important bit of information about Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> trade patterns when he reported that many of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were currently at the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages. <a href="#n0304" id="ln0304" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would soon learn much more about that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   connection, and disrupting it became one of the captains' leading diplomatic objectives.</p>
               <p>
Knowing that they would soon be with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> did not allay the ever present dread of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> ambush. October 2 proved to be a day filled with alarms and fear of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . Suspecting a surprise attack, "We prepared our selves for action which we expected every moment." Action seemed at hand early in the afternoon when a large <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> band appeared on a hill overlooking the north bank of the river. One of the warriors came down to the bank and fired his gun into the air. Certain that the attack was upon them, the expedition prepared to defend itself. <span class="tei_name">Whitehouse</span> later wrote, "we were determined to fight or dye." But that firm resolve was unnecessary as the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> party, whose intentions were never clear, left as quickly as it had appeared. <a href="#n0305" id="ln0305" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   warriors would not again menace the explorers until they wintered with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  .</p>
               <p>
As the expedition continued up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, there were more signs of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. On October 4, the captains saw the island village of <span class="tei_name">Lahoocatt</span>, a fortified town of some seventeen earth lodges. <span class="tei_name">Lahoocatt</span> had been occupied by an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> tribe that <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> called the <span class="tei_name">Laocatas</span>. About 1797 they had abandoned <span class="tei_name">Lahoocatt</span> and moved north to join the larger body of <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> at the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages. <a href="#n0306" id="ln0306" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> At the end of the first week of October, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw even more abandoned villages around the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Moreau River</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted a substantial settlement of "about 80 neet lodges covered with earth and picketed around." A brief examination of the site turned up bullboats, mats, and baskets. Three different kinds of squash were still growing in the untended village fields. <a href="#n0307" id="ln0307" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The following day, October 7, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> walked up the <span class="tei_name">Moreau River</span> bank about a mile to yet another vacant <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> town, this one consisting of some sixty lodges. Occupied as late as the previous winter, the village was strewn with mats, baskets, and bullboats. <a href="#n0308" id="ln0308" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

Earth lodges, fortifications, and extensive fields of corn, beans, and squash were all signs of the culture of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley villagers. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, or Star-rah-he as they called themselves, were the first of the northern plains villagers encountered by the expedition. <a href="#n0309" id="ln0309" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Virtually all European visitors to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> noted the linguistic affinity between the <span class="tei_name">Platte River</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> observed, "The <span class="tei_name">Loups</span> and all the different <span class="tei_name">Panis</span> now on the <span class="tei_name">River Platte</span>, made, undoubtedly with the <span class="tei_name">Ricaras</span> but one nation which time and circumstance have, without doubt insensibly divided." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> agreed. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, they wrote, "are the remains of ten large tribes of <span class="tei_name">Panias</span>." <a href="#n0310" id="ln0310" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> met by the expedition were descendants of people who came out of what later anthropologists called the Central Plains Tradition. These people built nearly square lodges with rounded corners in what is now western <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span> north of the <span class="tei_name">Arkansas River</span> drainage, and east and south-central <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>. Since the tradition is associated with the Caddoan language family, they were probably the predecessors of the historic 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnees</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>.</p>
               <p>
Sometime after A.D. 1400 these proto-<span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> began moving north out of the central plains into the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend</span> region of the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. This migration may have been occasioned by severe droughts on the central plains. As the proto-<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> entered the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, they settled in territory claimed by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . Early relations between the two peoples were generally peaceful. Indeed, housing styles of the Central Plains Tradition influenced <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> earth lodge construction. But by the middle-1400s, as the northern 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   began to reoccupy the <span class="tei_name">Bad</span>-<span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span> region, conflict erupted. One sign of conflict was the rise of fortified <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages. <a href="#n0311" id="ln0311" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Meeting stiff resistance, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   gradually withdrew during the 1450–1650 period, leaving the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> south of the <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> border open for <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> occupation. After the mid-sixteenth century and until the historic era, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> sites in the <span class="tei_name">Big Bend</span> and <span class="tei_name">Bad</span>-<span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span> regions were unfortified, a fact suggesting that fear of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> attack had considerably diminished. But that fairly peaceful interlude was shattered in the eighteenth century when the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   migration to the northern plains and increased tension with the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villagers once again caused <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages to be protected with enclosing ditches and palisades. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were to learn, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were entering a time of trouble—trouble not to be made any less by the presence of outsiders with unpredictable behavior and uncertain motives. <a href="#n0312" id="ln0312" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Characteristic of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> village life-style was the compact settlement with dome-shaped earth lodges, gardens, and nearby fields. <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns were all located around the mouths of major western tributaries of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Bad</span>, <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>, <span class="tei_name">Moreau</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Grand Rivers</span> were the foci of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> occupation in the historic period. Several related ecological factors determined the location of Indian villages. The rivers provided fresh water while the valleys offered a source of firewood. In addition, the east-west position of the valleys acted as natural highways guiding western tribes such as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , and Kiowas to the agricultural towns. <a href="#n0313" id="ln0313" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reached the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> in 1804, the villages were again fortified with ditches and palisades. The first extensive description of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> defenses of the kind seen by the captains comes from <span class="tei_name">Truteau's</span> 1795 journal. He noted that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages were ringed by palisdes five feet high and reinforced with earth. The palisades were made of stout willow or cottonwood poles "as thick as one's leg, resting on the crosspieces and very close together." Against the palisades was an earth embankment at least two feet thick. "In this way," he wrote, "the height of the poles would prevent the scaling of the fort by the enemy, while the well-packed earth protects those within from their balls and arrows." <a href="#n0314" id="ln0314" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Before the outbreak of smallpox in the 1780s, there were numerous <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages, each containing upwards of thirty-five earth lodges. By the advent of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> settlements clustered around the <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>, <span class="tei_name">Moreau</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Grand</span> rivers had grown to accommodate refugees from war and disease. The captains noticed recently abandoned towns of sixty loges; each of three villages visited during their interlude with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> had at least that number. The lodges were scattered in no apparent pattern, a deviation from the arrangement of them in rough lanes that recent anthropologists have identified as part of the Middle Missouri Tradition. When <span class="tei_name">Henry Brackenridge</span> visited the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns in 1811, he found the lodges built so close to each other that it was easy for a newcomer to become lost quickly. There was no central plaza, as in <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> towns, although the large medicine lodge did provide some spatial focus. <a href="#n0315" id="ln0315" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> earth lodges were the first of that distinctive housing described by the expedition. The circular design of the domestic earth lodge can be traced back to what is known as the Central Plains Tradition. The essential features of the historic earth lodge included a fire pit at the center of the floor, four primary posts to hold up the superstructure, a smoke hole in the roof, and a tunnel-like entrance. The average <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> lodge was about fifteen feet high and thirty feet in diameter. Replacing dirt washed away from the frame was an important task for women after every rain. <a href="#n0316" id="ln0316" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although many European visitors to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns attempted to describe the construction of earth lodges, few could bring the practiced eye of a carpenter to the subject as did <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span>. <a href="#n0317" id="ln0317" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> On October 10, 1804, <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and several other members of the expedition went to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> village at <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span>. While there, the sergeant took time to study earth lodges and their construction. <span class="tei_name">Gass's</span> description remains the best firsthand account of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> housing.</p>
               <p>
                  <blockquote><p>
In a circle of a size suited to the dimensions of the intended lodge, they set up 16 forked posts five or six feet high, and lay poles from one fork to another. Against these poles they lean other poles, slanting from the ground, and extending about four inches above the cross poles: these are to recieve the ends of the upper poles, that support the roof. They next set up four large forks, fifteen feet high, and about ten feet apart, in the middle of the area; and poles or beams between these. The roof poles are then laid on extending from the lower poles across the beams which rest on the middle forks, of such a length as to leave a hole at the top for a chimney. The whole is then covered with willow branches, except the chimney and hole below to pass through. On the willow branches they lay grass and lastly clay. At the hole below they build a pen about four feet wide and projecting ten feet from the hut; and hang a buffalo skin at the entrance of the hut for a door. <a href="#n0318" id="ln0318" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>

               </p>
               <p>
The earth lodge towns and their sedentary populations were possible because the villagers developed a complex strategy to wrest a living from the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> valley. Outsiders who visited the region in the summer months did not experience the demands placed on Indians for survival in the northern plains environment. Those demands included a climate of extremes from winters of—44°F to summer of +116°F and an average yearly rainfall of no more than sixteen inches. This rigorous climate yielded a frost-free growing season of no more than one hundred days a year. <a href="#n0319" id="ln0319" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Temperature, rainfall, and seasonal flooding meant agricultural uncertainties for Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> farmers. Despite these problems, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farming was productive enough to sustain village life and produce a substantial surplus for trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> agriculture centered on the production of several food crops and at least one ceremonial plant. <span class="italic">Zea mays,</span> the wild cereal grass, was the foundation crop for all Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> farmers. Edwin Denig, an American Fur Company official at <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span> in the mid-nineteenth century, reported the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn "seldom exceeds two and a half or three feet in height." Denig noted that each cornstalk contained only a few ears with kernels "small, hard, and covered with a thicker shell than that raised in warmer climates." <a href="#n0320" id="ln0320" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Although corn was the essential staple for diet and trade, other crops were cultivated by <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farmers. Beans were planted in the corn hills so that their vines could climb the stalks. Some of those bean seeds were collected by the captains and sent to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, who in April 1807 planted them. He reported them "very forward" in progress by April 18. On the first of May of the same year, <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> planted some <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn at <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span> and observed later that the plants produced ears suitable for roasting about a week after those coming from more familiar maize varieties. <a href="#n0321" id="ln0321" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Corn and beans, the two sister crops, were joined by a third, squash. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded in his journal that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> raised three kinds of squash. <a href="#n0322" id="ln0322" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Like <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> farmers, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women boiled some of the squash for immediate use while slicing and drying most of the crop for winter consumption. <a href="#n0323" id="ln0323" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> also grew pumpkins, watermelons, and tobacco. The tobacco attracted much of the expedition's attention. Both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span> quickly recognized that the Indian tobacco (<span class="italic">Nicotiana quadrivalis</span>) was something quite different from the Chesapeake varieties. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, always interested in precise botanical descriptions, observed that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> tobacco grew about three feet high, was planted in hills, and was harvested in late summer. The captain found smoking this tobacco "very pleasant." Gass agreed about the pipe qualities of the blend but added that it was less suited for chewing. <a href="#n0324" id="ln0324" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The land used by <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farmers was held by family groups as corporate property. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported, "They claim no land except that on which their villages stand and the fields which they cultivate." The fields were generally plots of about one or one-and-a-half acres. Each family's land was carefully marked with brush and pole fences. Apparently, there were two kinds of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farm lands seen by the expedition and by later visitors. Very close to the villages were fenced garden plots. As trade demands for increased production mounted, fields up to a mile away from the village center were cleared. Planting began in April or May, depending on weather and ground conditions, and harvest of the major corn crop was in early August. <a href="#n0325" id="ln0325" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
               </p>

As in many other American Indian tribes, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women did the farming. Europeans, accustomed to seeing men in the fields, consistently misunderstood the native division of labor and labeled Indian women "squaw drudges." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was not immune to that cultural blindness and insisted that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women "do the drugery as Common amongst Savages." <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> went further and charged that village women were virtual slaves to tyrannical husbands. <a href="#n0326" id="ln0326" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> What <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>, and other Europeans did not understand was the seasonal nature of woman's work, their companionship in the shared labor, the elevated ritual status of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women because of their role as earth mothers, and the substantial demands made on men in trade, war, and hunting. <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women farmed, using two simple but effective tools. Hoes or digging sticks were made from the shoulder blades of buffalo or deer. These scapular hoes were used to break ground and keep weeds from overgrowing the plots. A second implement was a rake fashioned by binding reeds to a long handle. Despite the uncertainties of climate and flooding, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> agriculture was very productive. As late as 1853, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farmers grew five thousand bushels of corn for sale outside the villages. <a href="#n0327" id="ln0327" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Agriculture was the foundation of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> economy, but hunting buffalo and other game animals was also important. When the corn crop failed, as it did in the summer of 1803 because of severe flooding, many <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> left the <span class="tei_name">Moreau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages to hunt on the plains. Hunting was far more than an expedient in hard times. The extended winter buffalo hunt was a necessary part of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> food supply. In October or November, hunting parties would leave the river villages in search of the herds. The mounted hunters carried skin tepees with them as they traveled far from the villages. Because of the close relationship between the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , village hunters sometimes spent the winter alongside the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . The <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> buffalo hunt was, at least until the mid-nineteenth century, strictly regulated by warriors especially selected for the occasion. Those warriors would arrange the placement of hunters and give signals for the rush to kill the animals. Their buffalo hunting was sometimes limited by interference from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . Anxious to remain the prime suppliers of hides and meat to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands blockaded the villages and kept hunters away from the herds. This happened in October 1803 and was further evidence of <span class="tei_name">Tabeau's</span> observation that the buffalo was "a very uncertain resource" for the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. <a href="#n0328" id="ln0328" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>

               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> neared the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages, they slowly learned about two aspects of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life that would shape their relations with the Indians. <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> politics might be best characterized as chaotic factionalism—a maze of interlocking lineage, village, and band loyalties complicated by the consequences of devastating epidemics. Just as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had to thread their way through <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> politics, so would they have to cope with men like <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Kakawita</span>, <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>. But with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   encounter still fresh in their minds, it was a second dimension of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life that commanded more of the captains' attention. During the troubled days at the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had heard about the complex web of trade that bound Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villagers and many western nomads together in an intricate system of cooperation, exchange, and intimidation. The importance of that system would be brought home to the explorers with considerable force during their interlude with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farmers were part of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Trade System. Their towns were the locale's focal points for the system while the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages on the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> served as the upper exchange centers. The villagers were engaged in supplying the agricultural needs of the nomads. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> aptly described the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> farmers as the "gardners for the Soues." <a href="#n0329" id="ln0329" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a> They grew corn, raised horses, and processed hides in return for a wide variety of merchandise and foodstuffs brought by their western and southwestern customers. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> listed among those customers the <span class="tei_name">Arapahos</span>, <span class="tei_name">Comanches</span>, <span class="tei_name">Kiowas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Osages</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Tawehashs</span>. But the most important customers of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . <a href="#n0330" id="ln0330" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> dealings with these two tribes were quite different, and those differences played a central role in expedition-Indian relations.</p>
               <p>
The often-troubled relationship between the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages and <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands was an uneasy symbiosis. From a <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> perspective, some sort of control had to be maintained over the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. As <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> population expanded west of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, reliable sources of food had to be found. Both <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> made plain to the captains the long-term 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   interest in controlling the flow of manufactured goods upriver to the village farmers. The overriding 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   need was for the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> food products and horses. Just how strong that need was can be seen in a preexpedition incident involving <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and his family. Sometime around 1800, one of <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> brothers paid a visit to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> town at <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span>. <span class="tei_name">Kakawita</span>, <span class="tei_name">Tabeau's</span> host, evidently had a grudge against the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> man. When he killed <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> brother, the <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> chief took revenge on five or six <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and a larger conflict seemed imminent. But as the August trading time approached and <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn ripened, all thoughts of warfare disappeared. <a href="#n0331" id="ln0331" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a> For the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , corn was more important than blood. That August, as in every other late summer and early fall, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands flocked to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns, bringing meat, fat, and hides from the plains and European-manufactured goods from the Dakota Rendezvous.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, like other non-Indian observers, consistently misunderstood the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   connection. Already disposed to cast the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> as "that lawless, savage, and rapacious race," the captains viewed the relationship as one of colonial exploitation. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that this economic link meant 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   political domination of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. As he explained, the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> maintained "great influence over the <span class="tei_name">Rickeres</span>, poison[ed] their minds and [kept] them in perpetial dread." To the captains, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villagers seemed helpless victims of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   aggression. In both their written records and in their diplomacy, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> argued that a disruption of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   alliance would free the village farmers from tyranny and might force <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands to accept American trade terms. The explorers, who had only limited experience with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, were not alone in believing that the villagers were an oppressed people. The trader <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> insisted that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> functioned as "a certain kind of serf" for the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . He declared that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were so fully dominated by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   that they were even compelled to buy their bows and arrows from the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>. <a href="#n0332" id="ln0332" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But this harsh view of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   relations was not shared by the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> themselves. They saw many advantages in the connection not quickly evident to outsiders. The economic advantages included a source of manufactured goods, especially guns, and a reliable market for corn and horses. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and the captains tended to overstate the violence and intimidation present in <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   dealings. There was, in fact, far more cooperation in times of war and friendship in times of peace. Much of the tension <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were to encounter between the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   was based on raids carried out by joint <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   war parties against the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. Among the objects sent back from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> was a buffalo robe painting of one such raid in 1797. <a href="#n0333" id="ln0333" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a> The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> knew well the military power of the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>, but they also knew how important their corn was to 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   survival. <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> was close to the mark when he wrote in 1795 that "the <span class="tei_name">Ricaras</span> and this 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   nation live together peacefully. The former recieve them in order to obtain guns, clothes, hats, kettles, clothes, etc., which are given them in exchange for their horses. They humor them through fear and to inevitably overpower them." <a href="#n0334" id="ln0334" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The captains themselves ran into the determination of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> to continue their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   connection. When the expedition stopped at the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages on the return journey, the explorer-diplomats tried in vain to convince the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs to sever 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   ties. Several chiefs, who grasped the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> balance of trade and power better than the neophyte Americans, replied that they "must trade with the <span class="tei_name">Sieoux</span> one more time to get guns and powder; that they had no guns or powder and more horses than they had use for, [and] after they got guns and powder . . . they would never again have any thing to do with them." <a href="#n0335" id="ln0335" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a> The captains had been put off in the best traditions of international diplomacy; once again their desire to rearrange traditional patterns of Indian behavior was thwarted.</p>
               <p>
If the captains and the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> had very different perceptions of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , both parties agreed that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   were far more acceptable and less troublesome customers. The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , who had abandoned farming in the eastern prairie valleys to become a plains people, depended heavily on the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> for foodstuffs and tobacco. Each summer many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   journeyed to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages to trade and renew old friendships. Some advance groups came in mid-June while larger parties arrived in mid-July. Some remained with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> well into the fall months, as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> discovered. <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span> traders brought to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> a wide variety of perishable meat products as well as exquisite skin clothing made by their women. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> especially valued "shirts of antelope skin, ornamented and worked with different colored quills of the porcupine." In addition to meat and fancy clothing, the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   also brought flour made from pounded prairie apples. Much of what they offered might be classed as luxury goods, but there was one 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   commodity that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> middlemen were very anxious to possess. 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   horses were essential to fill out herds in preparation for trading with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> wanted 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                   horses so badly that they were willing to trade precious guns, powder, and shot for them. During the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> period, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were prepared to trade one gun, one hundred rounds of ammunition, and a knife for one horse. The result of this trade, however, was that 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, arriving at the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages in October, did not see the festive trading days of August and September. Some fifteen to sixteen hundred people had thronged the trade fair, described by <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> as "this great gathering of different nations." Although there was always the threat of violence, especially between the competitive 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                  , the trading days were better occasions to make bargains and visit old friends. "Times are lively," noted Edwin Denig, "feasting and dancing goes on constantly, both in the village and camp—horse racing, gambling in many ways. Bucks and belles dressed in their best and tricked out in all the gaudy colors of cloth, paints, and porcupine quills may be seen mingled in the dance or exchanging their professions of love in more solitary places. The old men smoke and eat without intermission. The middle aged exchange horses and other property. The soldiers gamble. And the young warriors spend both day and night in attempts at seduction of the young women in both camps. Strange scenes are witnessed here, much that would be interesting, much more that would be indescribable." <a href="#n0337" id="ln0337" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Although the captains had not experienced those scenes, they surely had to face the consequences of those trading days. The alliances and friendships forged during the trade fairs would shape the responses of the Indians to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomacy in the days to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw little of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> ritual life during their brief October stay. Had they come earlier, they might have witnessed the impressive blessing-of-the-corn ceremony done to ensure an abundant harvest. Tabeau, who saw the three-day celebration, wrote that "everything breathes gaiety at this festival." An elaborate altar was set up in the lodge of the principal village chief. That altar was festooned with large gourds, arrows decorated to look like corn stalks, green branches, and dried meat. Empty baskets and scapular hoes were placed before the altar to symbolize the hope for a bountiful harvest. Crowns of plaited straw were to ward off insects and green branches were offerings to the moon and stars to gain good weather. To honor their role in agriculture, women arrayed in their best clothing sat near the center posts of the lodge. Having missed this ritual, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could not comment on it, nor on the many beliefs and rites surrounding the buffalo. Although the captains and their men spent considerable time visiting the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, no journalist in the expedition took note of the private altars and painted buffalo skulls present in every earth lodge. Nor did the explorers set down <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> ideas about the many spirits in their universe and the central force, "the Master of Life." <a href="#n0338" id="ln0338" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Because the expedition's members usually seemed aware of Indian architecture and village design, it is even more surprising that no journal contains any reference to the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> medicine lodge. This ritual lodge was often the largest earth structure in the village. Located near the center of the village, it shared some construction features with domestic lodges: four primary interior posts, a central fire pit, and a walled entrance passage. The lodge measured some fifty or sixty feet in diameter and, unlike the circular domestic lodges, was octagonal in shape. Inside the medicine lodge and opposite the entrance was a low platform or altar for ritual offerings. <a href="#n0339" id="ln0339" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were oblivious to the ritual ties that bound <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life together, they were very aware of the powerful force that threatened to unravel it. Beginning in the 1780s, smallpox epidemics swept through the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> trench, wreaking terrible havoc on all Indians. In the period before the epidemics, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> numbered perhaps twenty thousand to thirty thousand persons. <a href="#n0340" id="ln0340" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a> They belonged to many bands and lived in dozens of villages along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. The general western pandemic of 1780–81 killed perhaps seventy-five percent of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> population, causing the abandonment of many villages and the amalgamation of numerous political groups. When <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> visited the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> in 1795, he was told that there had already been three epidemics, reducing thirty-two villages to a mere handful. <a href="#n0341" id="ln0341" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a> That wave of disease was followed in 1801–1802 by another one. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>, writing about the 1803–1804 period, reported that "of the eighteen fairly large villages, situated upon the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> at some distance from each other, the <span class="tei_name">Ricaras</span> are reduced to three very mediocre ones." Although <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> recognized the role of war in this dramatic population decline, he was emphatic in arguing that smallpox "unexpectedly made this terrible ravage among them." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were only recording the obvious when they blandly noted that the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> were "much reduced" from previous numbers. <a href="#n0342" id="ln0342" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
For the history of expedition-Indian relations, the impact of the epidemics was most clearly seen in <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> politics. Although there is little evidence that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> developed political integration beyond the village level before the 1780–81 pandemic, the waves of disease so shattered the ranks of chiefs, elders, bundle holders, and important women as to make future intervillage leadership highly unlikely. As their numbers dropped and survivors from many different villages and lineages clustered into what amounted to refugee towns, intense factionalism flared between dozens of once powerful chiefs and warriors. Just as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> have to confront <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   internal politics, now they would have to deal with the domestic rivalries present in the three <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> settlements.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> was the first non-Indian to analyze <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> factional politics. The French trader recognized that the villages he knew around the <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne River</span> in 1795 were filled with the survivors of earlier epidemics. The chiefs were constantly engaged in "differences of opinion and wrangles for authority." <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> bealived that this factionalism, or "jealousy" as he termed it, was "the sole cause of their discord and their divisions." He reported that these factional controversies were sufficiently intense to cause some <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> to move north to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> region while others drifted south to live with the Pawnees. <a href="#n0343" id="ln0343" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>, who spent much more time with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> than either <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span> or the captains, added much valuable detail to <span class="tei_name">Truteau's</span> concept of factionalism bred by disease. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> had firsthand experience with the rivalries between Indian leaders. When he arrived among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, he became the object of much bickering between the <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span> village's civil chief <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> and a war chief named <span class="tei_name">Kakawita</span>. Both men wanted the honor and prestige of having <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> as a house guest. But the argument went well beyond hospitality. Whoever played host to the trader would reap considerable influence in village life. For <span class="tei_name">Kakawita</span>, leader of a small village recently come to <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span>, snaring <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> meant economic advantage and increased power. The Frenchman had another lesson in <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> factionalism when in August 1803 he attempted to convene a grand council to discuss trade arrangements. Knowing how many <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> males were designated as chiefs, the trader carefully invited forty-two of the leading men. To his surprise, he was berated for neglecting so many others. As <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> aptly put it, the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns were filled with "captains without companies." <a href="#n0344" id="ln0344" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a> Dialect differences, old rivalries, important families weakened by disease, and leaders without followers all made <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> politics treacherous ground for any outsider.</p>

At the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> visited them, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were living in three large villages on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>. These villages were founded sometime in the late 1790s after the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> abandoned their <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> settlements. <a href="#n0345" id="ln0345" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a> The first <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> village encountered by the expedition was <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span>, which consisted of about sixty earth lodges on <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span> in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span>. The island was fully cultivated, with corn and tobacco especially evident. Both <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and the captains reported that <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa, or the Crow at Rest</span>, was the leading civil chief in <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span>. However, during the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> period his authority was challenged by <span class="tei_name">Kakawita, or Man Crow</span>, war chief of the small village of <span class="tei_name">Narhkarica</span> recently come to <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span>. When the captains returned in 1806, <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> told them he had given his chief's medal to yet another <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span> chief, a man named <span class="tei_name">Grey Eyes</span>. People living on the island, along with those at the second village, were known to the captains as <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>-proper in order to distinguish them from the ethnically diverse <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> of the third town. That second village was upriver a short distance from <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span>. Part of what archaeologists call the <span class="tei_name">Leavenworth Site</span> (39C09), <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> was the lower of the two villages to share this location. <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> had about sixty to seventy lodges. <span class="tei_name">Pocasse or Hay</span> was the leading civil chief. <span class="tei_name">Cottonwood Creek</span> separated the earth lodges of <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> from those of <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span>. European visitors to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> recognized that <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> was different from the other villages in both language and ethnic mix. Answering a query from <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> in 1810, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported that <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> was composed of nine different tribes who had not been involved in recent (1790s) troubles with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   as had the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>-proper. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted, "A difference in pronounciation and some difference of language may be discovered between them and the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> proper." <a href="#n0346" id="ln0346" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>, who had more experience with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, agreed with <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> observation. The French trader characterized the differing <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> accents and inflections as "the tower of Babel." The leading civil chief in <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> was <span class="tei_name">Piahito, or Hawk's Feather</span>. Unlike the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>, who developed an intervillage council in the 1780s, factionalism and old suspicions kept the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> bands divided.

On October 8, 1804, as the Corps of Discovery passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span>, two of the explorers cam upon the <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span> village of <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described the three-mile-long island as "covered with fields, where those people raise their corn, tobacco, beans etc." As the flotilla passed the island, many <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> lined the banks to gawk at the strangers. The men were dressed in buffalo robes, leggings, and moccasins while the women wore fringed antelope dresses. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted that most of the warriors were well armed with northwest trade guns. <a href="#n0348" id="ln0348" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a> On a sandbar opposite the village were more <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> sightseers and a French trader. While <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> led most of the party to a campsite beyond the island, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and several crewmen in a pirogue went to talk with the trader. The captains had been told in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> that they might meet one "<span class="tei_name">Mr. Tebeaux</span>," who could give the explorers "much information in relation to that country." <a href="#n0349" id="ln0349" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a> The Frenchman on shore was <span class="tei_name">Tabeau's</span> fellow trader, <span class="tei_name">Joseph Gravelines</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described him as "a man well versed in the language of this nation [who] gave us some information relitive to the Country, nation etc." <a href="#n0350" id="ln0350" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Both <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> spoke the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> and

                   languages, skills much in demand for the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> talks. Later in the evening <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>, and some of the party went to <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span> carrying tobacco for a get-acquainted smoke. Heartened by that event and reassured by <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were "all friendly and glad to see us," the captains prepared for serious diplomacy the next day. <a href="#n0351" id="ln0351" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
               </p>

At camp during that first evening among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may well have discussed American diplomatic goals as applied to the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villagers. The captains surely did not accept <span class="tei_name">Truteau's</span> claim that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were "the key to the passages which we must traverse to reach all the nations higher up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>." <a href="#n0352" id="ln0352" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a> That distinction was reserved for the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . Nonetheless, the explorer-diplomats did not underestimate the importance of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> both as military allies of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and as potential American trading partners. They knew from their <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> contacts that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> had harrassed traders and often blocked their access upriver to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was honestly concerned about the reception the expedition would receive when he wrote that the Americans were prepared for war or peace with the villagers. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had not given the explorers the kind of precise instructions for the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> negotiations as he had for dealings with the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . However, the general observations in the president's instructions to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and the recent experiences with the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> served to clarify what the expedition hoped to achieve while at the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages. On one level these objectives were the same as pursued since the beginning of the voyage. The captains were to assert United States sovereignty over Louisiana Purchase lands. Military parades and airgun displays were put on to make Indians stand in awe of American power. As they had done with other tribes, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> planned to distribute medals and uniforms to chiefs ready to support American authority. Old rivalries were to be forgotten and peace was to obtain among all the tribes. Such a peace was a prerequisite for another cornerstone of American policy: the promotion of trade with American merchants. Although the captains knew from <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> informants and from conversations with <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> could not supply beaver pelts, the market for goods to replace those of English manufacture was great. <a href="#n0353" id="ln0353" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Sovereignty, client chiefs, and trade were all important subjects for discussion with the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs. But if the events of the interlude with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> proved any test, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had other things on their minds as well. Those other concerns focused on the complex relations between the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. The explorers only gradually sensed how intricate those relations were. As they began talks with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, the captains perceived the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span> as ferocious enemies to undercut, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> as unwilling dupes of the rapacius 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , and the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> as a force of unknown dimensions. With a naive optimism typical of so much Euro-American frontier diplomacy, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed they could easily reshape Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> realities to fit their expectations. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were to be weaned away from dependence on the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>. An American-inspired alliance of all Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villagers might further weaken the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  . On the night before the negotiations began, those goals seemed within reach. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew from <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> moves had been underway in the past six months to lessen tensions with the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> peoples. But the captains also knew that the Laocata band of <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> had done all it could to sabotage an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-<span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> peace. The Laocata action was a reminder that the violent events of the 1790s were not forgotten. Weakening the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   connection and promoting peace among all the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villagers seemed a rational and beneficial policy to both the captains and their trader allies. <a href="#n0354" id="ln0354" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a> To the surprise of the explorer-diplomats, virtually all Indian parties proved resistant to change and suspicious of American motives.</p>
               <p>
During the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> face-off it had been evident that <span class="tei_name">Brulé</span> politicians like <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Partisan</span> had a clear concept of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> interests and the personal stature to make decisions promoting those interests. In the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> political world of "captains without companies," it proved more difficult to articulate a policy toward non-Indian outsiders. Civil chiefs, leading warriors, elders, and important families found their authority fragmented and open to challenge in the troubled times after the epidemics. Having the remnants of several bands living in one village made for political tensions unknown in <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life before disease forced such amalgamation. This state of affairs would remain unchanged for years. When the Astorians were among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> in 1811, some village chiefs attempted to block the progress of that expedition unless substantial gifts were offered. This decision was openly opposed by several elders who urged the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> to "behave well towards white people," arguing that "the advantages they derived by intercourse with them" far outweighed any danger. <a href="#n0355" id="ln0355" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a> In the fall of 1804, village chiefs like <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> had considerable influence, but their power to determine and enforce policies was limited by cultural attitudes toward leadership as well as by the presence of refugee bands who did not accept decisions made by others. Chiefs, leading families, and ordinary <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> saw little reason to exchange valuable and reliable dealings with the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   for the uncertainties of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade and <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> friendship. Village chiefs would be polite to the white strangers and might even make some promises, but the real <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> interest was to have the Americans move on with the least disruption to the old ways of war and trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> hoped to begin talks with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> on October 9. Invitations had been sent by way of <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> and <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> to <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span>, <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>. A flag pole had been raised at the expedition's camp and some preparations were underway to begin the now-familiar display of military pomp and hardware. Sometime before noon the three chiefs appeared and the obligatory smoking began. The visual impact of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomacy required good weather for marching, shooting, and distributing gifts. When it became plain that this Tuesday would be windy, rainy, and cold, all agreed to postpone discussions until the following day. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and Americans spent the rest of the day visiting each other. During those visits, <span class="tei_name">York</span> proved to be the greatest attraction, as he would be on subsequent days. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote that the villagers were "much astonished at my black Servent, who did not lose the opportunity of displaying his powers, strength etc." <a href="#n0356" id="ln0356" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Clear weather the next day seemed promising for a council session. After breakfast with <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>, the captains made all the necessary preparations for the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> arrival. After the flag was raised and many of the men donned dress uniforms, the camp was ready to greet its Indian visitors. By midmorning <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> and several leading men from <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span> had arrived. But to the captains' dismay, delegations from the two other villages were conspicuously absent. That absence was a clear indication of the tension between the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns. <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span>, <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>, and their respective village councils were fearful that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might make <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> the "grand chief." Such an action would upset the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> balance of power and possibly had no precedent in <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> history. The captains, having learned something about internal Indian politics while among the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>, recognized the source of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> concern. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> observed, "We have every reason to believe that a gellousy exists between the Villages for fear of our making the first chief from the lower village." But recognizing the problem did not mean that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were willing to alter their decision to make <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> the first or grand chief. At noon, increasingly concerned over the delay and worried that the talks might crumble, the captains asked <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> to go over to the villages and again invite <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> to the council. <a href="#n0357" id="ln0357" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Early in the afternoon the two reluctant chiefs and several principal men arrived at the expedition's camp. After smoking the required pipe, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> stood and "read a speech to them giving them good counsel." This prepared talk, interpreted to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> by <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span>, was probably the same one delivered to other tribes from the beginning of the voyage. As the captains told the Otos, "the great chief of the Seventeen great nations of America, impelled by his parental regard for his newly adopted children on the troubled waters, has sent us out to clear the road, remove every obstruction, and make it the road of peace between himself and his red children residing there." <a href="#n0358" id="ln0358" class="ref_link"><sup>[58]</sup></a> The speech stressed the now-familiar themes of federal Indian policy in the early Trans-<span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> West. The acceptance of United States sovereignty, peace between the tribes, and trade with American merchants would be rewarded by the protection and favor of the great chief of the seventeen fires.</p>
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was slowly reading his speech, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> attention was seized by something in the audience that put a new urgency to the negotiations: the presence of two <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>

                  , one of whom <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recognized from the troubled days at the <span class="tei_name">Bad River</span>. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was certain that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   were there to thwart the progress of the expedition and retain some measure of control over <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> affairs. If the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> ambassadors succeeded in playing on the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> fears, especially those of <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might have to face a second Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian confrontation. <a href="#n0359" id="ln0359" class="ref_link"><sup>[59]</sup></a>

With <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> talk finished, the display of military firepower and the all-important distribution of gifts began. As if to put an exclamation point to <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> presentation, three shots were fired from the bow swivel gun on the keelboat. The captains may have hoped the two 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   would be reminded of how close those guns had come to firing on their warriors just a few days before. When the smoke cleared, out came gift bale number fifteen, marked and prepared for the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> use months before in <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. The bale contained a bewildering array of goods, all representing what the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> might obtain by trading directly with <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> merchants. There was a pound of vermilion paint for the warriors, three pewter looking glasses for young girls, and over four hundred needles for <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> laid out their country store of merchandise, ranging from cloth, beads, combs, razors, and rolls of wire to nine pairs of scissors, knives, tomahawks, and even six Jew's harps. For the chiefs there were military coats, cocked hats, medals, and American flags. Notably absent from the gifts was any alcohol. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> made it plain to all European visitors that the drink was unwelcome. As they explained to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, those whites who gave Indians alcohol were not friends but were simply interested in seeing natives act the fool. <a href="#n0360" id="ln0360" class="ref_link"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Knowing that there was "gellousy" among the three <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages over whose chief was to be afforded highest honors, the captains might have exercised some caution in handing out uniforms and medals and in naming chiefs to certain ranks. But Euro-American practice had always been to designate one Indian as the principal chief, whether that particular group sanctioned such a position or not. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not about to break with tradition, even if it caused more tension within <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> politics and made 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   efforts at sowing discord easier. <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> of <span class="tei_name">Saw-haini</span> was named "grand chief" with the appropriate medal, while <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> were offered medals of lesser grades. At the same time, perhaps to soothe bruised pride, other goods were given to each chief in equal measure. To signal the end of the conference, the airgun was brought out and fired. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> observed that the chiefs "appeared to be astonished at the sight of it and the execution it would do." As was their custom, the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that an answer, or rather three answers, to the American speech would come the next day. This was neither an attempt to deceive the explorers nor a ploy to draw out the negotiations. Rather, it was an acceptance of the fact that all decisions were the result of a consensus reached by elders in a village council. Since there was no <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> tribal council, each village would present a separate reply. The presence of <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> representatives and the naming of <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> as leading chief only complicated the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> task of responding to the American views. <a href="#n0361" id="ln0361" class="ref_link"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
With the talks over, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and one other expedition member went to visit <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> while <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> took a party to sample food and hospitality at <span class="tei_name">Sawa-haini</span>. That afternoon of sightseeing and friendly talk produced some valuable information about <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life as well as scenes of comic proportion. <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> congenial stay in <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> gave the sergeant and his companion a chance to sample the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> diet. Welcomed into <span class="tei_name">Pocasse's</span> lodge, the Americans sat on woven mats and were served by the chief's wife. They were brought a bowl of beans and corn, the staple of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> fare. Following that dish, three different but unnamed Indian foods were offered to the Americans. "We ate some of each," wrote <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, "and found very good." If he was fascinated with Indian menus, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were equally intrigued by the looks and manners of the explorers. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> wrote later that those Indians "were very friendly to us and seemed to be desirous to talk with us and scarcely kept their eyes off us." <a href="#n0362" id="ln0362" class="ref_link"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Usually a keen observer of the common things in native life, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> strangely neglected to record anything about the interior furnishings of the earth lodge. In fact, no journalist in the expedition took note of lodge interiors.</p>
               <p>
While <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> was tasting <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> cooking, <span class="tei_name">Gass's</span> party made its way to <span class="tei_name">Ashley Island</span>. If <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> failed to examine lodge furnishings, <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> did not neglect details of exterior construction. His careful description, quoted earlier, is the best surviving account of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> housing. He offered an earth lodge portrait that squares with archaeological studies done at the two upper villages. <a href="#n0363" id="ln0363" class="ref_link"><sup>[63]</sup></a> But it was <span class="tei_name">York</span> who proved the center of attraction that afternoon. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were both attracted to and terrified by his blackness. Having never seen a black man, they were quite unsure if <span class="tei_name">York</span> was a man, a beast, or a strange and powerful spirit being. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> later explained that <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> who had seen whites but not blacks thought <span class="tei_name">York</span> "something strange &amp; from his very large size more vicious than whites." On the other hand, those <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> who had seen neither whites nor blacks were convinced that all members of the expedition, regardless of color, were possessed with extraordinary powers. <span class="tei_name">York</span> thoroughly enjoyed his newfound celebrity status and had already "made himself more turribal" than the captains wished. <a href="#n0364" id="ln0364" class="ref_link"><sup>[64]</sup></a> That afternoon <span class="tei_name">York</span> and hordes of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> children had chased each other, the black man bellowing at them that he was a wild bear caught and tamed by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>. What may have worried the captains in this playful sport was <span class="tei_name">York's</span> boast that he ate human flesh. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> practiced ritual cannibalism of their fallen enemies, but that was a far cry from consuming village youth. <a href="#n0365" id="ln0365" class="ref_link"><sup>[65]</sup></a> With <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs embroiled in factional disputes and <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> agents ready to use those tensions against the expedition, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not need rumors drifting through the earth lodges that the Americans kept a great he-bear ready to eat Indian children.</p>
               <p>
Some of the captains' fears about <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> reactions evaporated the next morning. Toward noon, <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> arrived at the expedition's camp. In accordance with the notion of reciprocity in gift giving, the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> leader brought baskets of corn, beans, and dried squash. While those provisions were surely appreciated, <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa's</span> reply to <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> speech was even more welcome.</p>
               <p>
The chief's speech contained three important elements. First, there was the immediate question of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   influence on the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> behavior toward the expedition. The two <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> emissaries had certainly argued for some direct action against the explorers. Although the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were not known as great warriors, in the years after <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> they would be very effective in blocking American access up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. But <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> made it plain at the beginning that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> weapons would not be turned against the explorers. "Can you think," declared the chief, "any one dare put their hands on your rope of your boat. No! not one dare." Proclaiming the road open, <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> turned to his second point. In reply to the call for intertribal peace, the chief asked the captains to "speak good words" to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   on behalf of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>. Seeing two of their diplomatic goals seemingly accepted without opposition or argument, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have been pleased when the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief expressed an interest in becoming part of the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> trade system. Although <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> lamented the fact that beaver pelts were not available for <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women to process, he promised a good supply of buffalo robes. More important, he promised to aid American traders in entering Cheyenne and <span class="tei_name">Arapaho</span> markets. <a href="#n0366" id="ln0366" class="ref_link"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Taken at face value, what <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> told <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> promised a real victory for American policy and the expedition's negotiating skill. After the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> troubles, the captains needed such a victory. But <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa's</span> speech was actually much more and much less than it appeared to be. That the captains accepted it literally only suggests how innocent they were of Indian realities. On the issue of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  -inspired attempts to forcibly detain the expedition, <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> was forth-right in saying that <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> advice had been rejected. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took this to signal a weakening of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   alliance. But postexpedition events did not bear out the captains' optimistic evaluation. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were not about to abandon their 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   trade connection for an uncertain link with <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. American merchants, interested in beaver, could not take the place of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   middlemen as both suppliers of manufactured goods and customers for <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn and horses. <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life was based on the production of agricultural surpluses that would have little place in an American fur trade. That the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> did not envision severing the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   alliance was to be made painfully clear in 1807, when both <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> and <span class="tei_name">Nathaniel Pryor</span> encountered hostility from <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   forces.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> peace overture, an integral part of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> Indian diplomacy, also was not quite what the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> speaker made it out to be. Despite their best efforts during the talks with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and later during the winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, the captains found the old <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-<span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> tensions not easily overcome. The peace policy, actually part of a larger anti-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   thrust, was doomed to failure by both <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> military power and persistent villager rivalries. In 1810, an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-<span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> alliance would field several war parties against the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  , but those joint ventures would be short-lived. More important, the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> bands engaged in massive economic retaliation against <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> towns, ensuring the demise of any villager alliance. <a href="#n0367" id="ln0367" class="ref_link"><sup>[67]</sup></a> It may be that the willingness of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> to allow <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to pass unimpeded was an abberation. In the years after the expedition, as <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span> brought the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   into the American trading orbit, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> assumed the <span class="tei_name">Tetons'</span> old hostile role. Fearing that <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> power was increasing by the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> connection while their fortunes declined, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> successfully blockaded the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Certainly American agents and merchants like the Chouteaus and <span class="tei_name">William H. Ashley</span> found the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> to be implacable foes. Only gradually did American diplomats learn that flowery speeches and a few gifts could not easily transform Indian loyalties.</p>
               <p>
But the nuances of <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa's</span> speech eluded <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and early in the afternoon, believing they had achieved their goals, the captains ordered the expedition a short distance upriver to a camp closer to the twin villages of <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> and <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span>. With <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> and one of his nephews on board the keelboat, the explorers made their way toward the upper villages. <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> joined the boat party and late in the afternoon the whole group landed at a sandbar just below <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span>. They were greeted by knots of curious villagers anxious to catch a glimpse of the strangers. The whole scene was made more colorful by several American flags snapping in the river breeze. The captains paused for a moment to take a sextant reading, something the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were certain was just one more piece of the explorers' spiritual magic, and then walked up to <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> with <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span>. The chief made <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> a gift of corn and beans while others in the party ate <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> porridge and bread. After staying some time at <span class="tei_name">Rhtarahe</span> "talking on various subjects," the Americans paid a brief visit to <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> and its chief, <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>. There, too, the explorers enjoyed Indian food and hospitality. Promises were exchanged about talks the next day, and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> judged the situation that evening as "all tranquillity." <a href="#n0368" id="ln0368" class="ref_link"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
October 12 was the last full day the expedition spent among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>; nothing happened to shake the captains' confidence that they had convinced village chiefs to accept American policies. Yet, had the explorers listened more carefully to speeches made by <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>, they might have been less certain of their victory. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>, in the company of interpreters, spent the morning listening to the chiefs' speeches while <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> boat parties did some small-scale trading. <a href="#n0369" id="ln0369" class="ref_link"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Those final talks began with the captains reminding the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> of "the magnitude and power of our country." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> confidently recorded that those words "pleased and astonished them verry much." <a href="#n0370" id="ln0370" class="ref_link"><sup>[70]</sup></a> The speech delivered by <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> contained much that the explorers wanted to hear. <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> reaffirmed the obvious: the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> planned no hostile action against the expedition. He declared his interest in a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> peace and also expressed some desire to visit with <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>. At the end of the talk, almost as an afterthought, <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> suggested yet another doubt about severing the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   connection. With the exposed location of the villages and the temporary nature of American forces, what guarantees of safety did the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> have against retaliation by the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>? <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> put it simply: "After you set out, many nations in the open plains may come to make war against us, we wish you to stop their guns and prevent it if possible." <a href="#n0371" id="ln0371" class="ref_link"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The doubts and fears expressed by <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> were amplified when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> met with <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span>. This <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief gave the captains a quick lesson in Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> power politics. The people of <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> were distinct in language and past history from the other villages. <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> had not taken part in the recent and still smoldering <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> war. <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> was very skeptical that wounds still fresh couuld be quickly healed by some of the expedition's diplomatic salve. Had they more fully understood what <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> had to say, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might have sensed how formidable a task it would be to rearrange traditional alliances and cure old hurts.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> opened his remarks by bluntly saying he would believe a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> peace only when he saw it with his own eyes. As much as he doubted <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> intentions, he also questioned 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   motives, declaring that the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> "has not a good heart." If <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> offered the captains some healthy skepticism about intertribal relations, he also presented an equally realistic appraisal of intra-<span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> affairs. <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> said he always followed the lead of <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> and that they would watch over <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> while he went up to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted their message to be accepted by the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> leadership, and <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> reassured the explorers that at least <span class="tei_name">Kakawissassa</span> and <span class="tei_name">Pocasse</span> "believe your words." But the <span class="tei_name">Waho-erha</span> chief also seemed to issue a veiled warning about a unity of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> views more apparent than real. "Maybe we will not tell the truth" was hardly the strong statement of approval the captains wanted from the chief. <span class="tei_name">Piahito</span> again stressed his concern about a trip to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . What would an alliance with the Mandan Indians<span class="tei_name"/>
                   mean, how might the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   react, and what possible benefits wouuld the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> gain from such a move? As the formal talks ended and one of the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chiefs agreed to go with the captains to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , all those doubts and questions were unresolved. <a href="#n0372" id="ln0372" class="ref_link"><sup>[72]</sup></a>

            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
If official relations with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were troubled by some unsettling issues, unofficial and personal affairs with <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women went on quite satisfactorily. For the first time since leaving <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, the young men of the expedition had ample time and opportunity for sexual contacts with Indian women. Those liaisons must be understood from both sides of the cultural divide. To ignore them here and later would be to deny the humanity of the expedition and to turn a blind eye on much of the historical record.</p>
               <p>
Sexual experiences, like all intimate encounters, may mean very different things to persons of dissimilar cultures. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> perception of sexual intercourse and the role of women in the act differed markedly from that of the expedition's males. First, it must be said that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, like their <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> neighbors, placed a very high value on women. They were the principal agriculturists, and that economic position meant ritual prominence as well. Women were neither the drudges nor the pawns of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> men so often portrayed in the records of white visitors. <a href="#n0373" id="ln0373" class="ref_link"><sup>[73]</sup></a> Further, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> matrilineal society did not place as much importance on exclusive sexual relations with male spouses. As one <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> told <span class="tei_name">Truteau</span>, "When a man dies he cannot carry women with him to the regions of the dead; and . . . they who quarrel, fight, and kill each other about the possession of a woman, are fools or mad-men." <a href="#n0374" id="ln0374" class="ref_link"><sup>[74]</sup></a> That young <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women were anxious for sexual encounters with non-Indians was noted by virtually every visitor. As John Bradbury put it, "Travelers who have been acquainted with savages, have remarked that they are either very liberal of their women to strangers, or extremely jealous. In this species of liberality no nation can be exceeded by the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span>, who flocked down every evening with their wives, sisters, and daughters, each anxious to meet with a market for them." <a href="#n0375" id="ln0375" class="ref_link"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Interest in sex with strangers was based on three distinct cultural sanctions. The <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villagers were eager to obtain European goods, and having sexual relations with traders meant receiving those objects in payment for favors. Ironware, paint, blue beads, and cloth were all part of the exchange. <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women demanded and got high prices for their services. As Bradbury testified, "I observed several instances wherein the squaw was consulted by her husband as to the <span class="italic">quantum sufficit</span> of price, a mark of consideration which, from some knowledge of Indians, and the estimation in which their women are held, I had not expected." <a href="#n0376" id="ln0376" class="ref_link"><sup>[76]</sup></a> But having sexual relations with a trader provided more than a supply of scarce luxury goods. Because they were central figures in the staple food trade with other tribes, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women hoped to forge commercial links with white merchants. Sex, as <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were to discover at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, was an important way to seal a business arrangement.</p>
               <p>
Sex with visitors was also an integral part of northern plains hospitality. When Bradbury visited an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> lodge, he found that the welcome included not only a bed but a "bedfellow." <a href="#n0377" id="ln0377" class="ref_link"><sup>[77]</sup></a> As the captains learned during the <span class="tei_name">Teton</span> confrontation, to reject such offers was to court misunderstanding and suspicion. If intercourse with non-Indian males strengthened trade ties and expressed traditional hospitality, it also signified something far more complex in northern plains life. The <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> and their neighbors, both villagers and nomads alike, perceived sexual contact as a means of transferring spiritual power from one person to another. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> buffalo-calling ceremony was only the most spectacular example of this belief. In that ritual, women had intercourse with elderly men, taking the seminal skill of old hunters and passing it on to their husbands. Sex became a kind of conduit for power. In the same way, <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women sought sex with Europeans as a way to pass the strength and skill of the outsiders on to their mates. As John Ewers has written, the "concept of the transmission of power through sexual intercourse seemed to have played a part in the eagerness of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> women to cohabit with white men in the early days of the fur trade." <a href="#n0378" id="ln0378" class="ref_link"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> understood the sense of awe when he wrote, "The Indians believed that these traders were the most powerful persons in the nation." <a href="#n0379" id="ln0379" class="ref_link"><sup>[79]</sup></a> Sex was a means to appropriate that power and place it at their disposal.</p>
               <p>
There is little doubt that the men of the expedition found <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women attractive. They surely did not agree with <span class="tei_name">Tabeau's</span> charge that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> females were "the most ugly and have the advantages of surpassing all the others in slovenliness." One who disagreed was <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>. Writing that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were "the most cleanly Indians I have ever seen on this voyage," the sergeant added that village women were "handsome" and "the best looking Indians I have ever seen." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> agreed, noting that "some of their women are very handsome and clean." Even <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, who characterized the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> as "pore and Durtey," recalled to <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> that the "<span class="tei_name">Ricara</span> women [were] better looking than the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                  ." <a href="#n0380" id="ln0380" class="ref_link"><sup>[80]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
In the notebook journals of the expedition, there are only the most oblique references to sexual contact with <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> claimed that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> overtures were rejected while the expedition was at the villages but implied that once the party departed on October 12 it was quite a different story. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded that on the evening of the 12th two young women were sent by an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> man "and persisted in their civilities." In his plainest statement about intimate relations with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> written while the expedition was in progress, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted that the women were "very fond of carressing our men." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was less reticent when he answered questions for <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> in 1810. He frankly admitted that the men "by means of interpreters found no difficulty in getting women." He believed that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women were "lecherous" and engaged in sexual adventures "without the husband's knowledge." However, in the same note to <span class="tei_name">Biddle</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported that "the husbands etc. [gave] wives and sisters to strangers." <a href="#n0381" id="ln0381" class="ref_link"><sup>[81]</sup></a> Other travelers observed that <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> women usually initiatied sexual encounters, and there seems to be little doubt that the men in the expedition accepted the offers.</p>
               <p>
The only fully documented case of this involved <span class="tei_name">York</span>. In the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> eyes, <span class="tei_name">York</span> was the central attraction of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition. Airguns, gifts, and strange doings with a sextant all paled in significance before <span class="tei_name">York</span>. The black man fascinated Indian adults and terrified their children. <span class="tei_name">York's</span> blackness was viewed by the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> as a sign of special spiritual power, and they appropriately named him "the big Medison." To have sexual contact with <span class="tei_name">York</span> was to get in touch with what seemed awesome spirit forces. On one occasion an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> man invited <span class="tei_name">York</span> to his lodge, offered him his wife, and guarded the entrance during the act. When a member of the expedition came looking for <span class="tei_name">York</span>, "the master of the house would not let him in before the affair was finished." <a href="#n0382" id="ln0382" class="ref_link"><sup>[82]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Perhaps the most telling comment on the sexual desires of visitors among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> came in a conversation that <span class="tei_name">Henry M. Brackenridge</span> reported having with a village chief: " 'I was wondering,' said he, 'whether you white people have any women amongst you.' I assured him in the affirmative. 'Then,' said he, 'why is it that your people are so fond of our women, one might suppose they had never seen any before?' " <a href="#n0383" id="ln0383" class="ref_link"><sup>[83]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Early in the afternoon of October 12, with the talks completed and one of the village chiefs on board, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> left the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> settlements. It was a festive departure, with "the fiddle playing and the horns sounding." The days that followed were filled with small incidents that added to the sum of Indian-expedition relations. One of those revealing events took place on October 14 when <span class="tei_name">Private John Newman</span> was sentenced to corporal punishment for "mutinous expression." <span class="tei_name">Newman's</span> whipping "allarmed the Indian chief very much." Virtually all native American cultures rejected public physical punishment of either children or adults, believing that confomrity to social norms might be better achieved by more subtle group pressure. As the expedition moved toward its <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> wintering quarters, there was time to record additional bits of ethnographic data. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> noted an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> stone monument surrounded by votive offerings. At another time <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> chief walked along the shore as the Indian recounted "a number of their traditions about turtles, snakes, etc. and the power of a particular rock or cove on the next river which informs of every thing." Sadly for the ethnographic record, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that "none of those I think worth mentioning." <a href="#n0384" id="ln0384" class="ref_link"><sup>[84]</sup></a>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>
As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> headed toward the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, they left behind with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> a strange set of impressions. Although the villagers had been acquainted with whites for some time, they had never seen such a large group of visitors. The intentions and behavior of the captains, their technology, and the presence of <span class="tei_name">York</span> all produced a vivid folklore. <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span>, who dutifully recorded some of the tales, found himself in "a bad scrape by treating them as ridiculous." <span class="tei_name">Kakawita</span>, <span class="tei_name">Tabeau's</span> leading <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> informant, reported what was widely believed among the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> about the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition. In their opinion, the explorers were on a special vision quest and had met "obstacles perhaps invincible" on their journey. One of those obstacles was reputed to be an awesome beast without a mouth who ate by "breathing the smoke of the meat through the nose." Even more terrible, related the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> storytellers, was "a troop of Amazons who kill all their male children, pulverize their genitals and conceive again by the injection of the powder obtained." Just how the expedition overcame those monsters is not part of the surviving record. What finally impressed the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> were the objects carried by the expedition. The sextant, the magnet, and phosphorous were talked about as evidence of the captains' spirit powers. And, of course, there was <span class="tei_name">York</span>. As <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> wrote, "The most marvelous was, though, a large fine man, black as a bear who spoke and acted as one." <a href="#n0385" id="ln0385" class="ref_link"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party carried away from their time with the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> many personal memories of the sort not readily committed to the pages of diaries or official reports. There can be no doubt that after the tense days with the <span class="tei_name">Tetons</span>, the relaxed hospitality of the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> was a welcome change. It remained for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to record his impressions of the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villagers. Of the people, he wrote, "They appear to be peaceful, their men tall and perpotiend, women Small and industerous." Recalling their hospitality, he described the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> as "Durtey, Kind, pore and extravigent." <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> expressive word <span class="italic">extravigent</span> was his way of drawing attention to the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras'</span> generosity with food and favors. Pleased to give gifts, the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> took "what was offered with great pleasure." <a href="#n0386" id="ln0386" class="ref_link"><sup>[86]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
There was much about <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> culture that the captains either did not understand or did not see. Politics, sacred bundles, band organization, and the yearly round of ritual and ceremony all eluded the explorers. What the expedition's journalists did record was the exterior of <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> life—an exterior of substantial earth lodges, well-tended fields, and friendly people. American frontiersmen, who valued a secure house and good crops, found much to admire during their time with the Star-rah-he.
