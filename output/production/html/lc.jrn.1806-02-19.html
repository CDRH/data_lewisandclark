The Black tailed fallow deer <a href="#n28021902" id="ln28021902" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> are peculiar to this coast and are a distinct species of deer partaking equally of peculiarities of the mule deer and the common deer.    their ears are reather larger and their winter coat darker than the common deer; the recepticle of the eye or drane is mor conspicuous; their legs shorter and body thicker and larger than the common deer; their tail is about the length of our deer or from 8 to 10 inches the hair on the underside of which is white, and that of it's sides and top quite black    the horns resemble in form and colour those of the mule deer which it also resembles in it's gate; that is bounding with all four feet off the ground at the same time when runing at full speed and not loping as the common deer or antelope do.    they are sometimes found in the woodlands but most frequently in the praries and open grounds.    they may be said generally to be a size larger than the common deer and that less than the mule deer. they are very seldom found in good order, or fat, even in the season which the common deer are so, and their flesh is inferior to any species of deer which I have evern seen.—

in expectation of the weather being better by morning.—
