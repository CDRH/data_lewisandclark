         <div class="preface  tei_div">
            <p>

This volume and the two to follow rely largely on the editorial work of previous
books in this edition. Therefore, the editorial notes and supporting material in
these three books owe a debt to former consultants and friends of the project. Here
again we extend our great appreciation to the unselfish work of these generous
people.</p>
            <p>
Nevertheless, we have several persons to thank specifically for help with this volume. The journal of <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Sergeant John Ordway</a> is located at the American Philosophical
Society, <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a>, where the project received the able assistance of Beth <a class="regularization" title="Cann, E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cann%2C%20E.">Carr</a>oll-Horrocks, Martin L. Levitt, Martha Harrison, Roy E. Goodman, and Edward C. Carter II. At the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison, we were aided with the journal of <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd</a> by Josephine L. Harper and Harry Miller. Closer
to home, help came from John R. Wunder, Linda J. Ratcliffe, and Sharon Bays of
the Center for Great Plains Studies, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, and Thomas
W. Dunlay and Doris VanSchooten of the project.</p>
