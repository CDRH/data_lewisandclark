Set out early this morning.    previous to our departure saw a large herd of the Bighorned anamals on the immencely high and nearly perpendicular clift opposite to us; <a href="#n17071801" id="ln17071801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> on the face of this clift they walked about and bounded from rock to rock with apparent unconcern where it appared to me that no quadruped could have stood, and from which had they made one false step the[y] must have been precipitated at least a 500 feet.    this anamal appears to frequent such precepices and clifts where in fact they are perfectly secure from the pursuit of the wolf, bear, or even man himself.—    at the distance of 2½ miles we passed the entrance of a considerable river on the Stard. side; about 80 yds. wide being nearly as wide as the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> at that place.    it's current is rapid and water extreamly transparent; the bed is formed of small smooth stones of flat rounded or other figures.    it's bottoms are narrow but possess as much timber as the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>.    the country is mountainous and broken through which it passes.    it appears as if it might be navigated but to what extent must be conjectural.    this handsome bold and clear stream we named in honour of the Secretary of war calling it 
                     Dearborn's river.— <a href="#n17071802" id="ln17071802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    as we were anxious now to meet with the <a class="regularization" title="Shoshone Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Shoshone%20Indians">Sosonees</a>
