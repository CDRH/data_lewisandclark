A shower of rain fell very early this morning after which we dispatched the men for the remaining baggage at the 6 mile stake. <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton</a> seting their tarkiln, Sergts. <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> at work on the waystrips and myself and all other hands engaged in puting the boat together which we accomplished in about 3 hours and I then set four men at work sewing the leather over the cross bars of Iron on the inner side of the boat, which form the ends of the sections.    about 2 P. M. the party returned with the baggage, all well pleased that they had completed the laborious task of the portage. The Musquetoes uncommonly troublesome    the wind hard from the S. W. all day    I think it possible that these almost perpetual S. W. winds proceede from the agency of the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis (Snowy) Range" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lewis%20%28Snowy%29%20Range">Snowey Mountains</a> and the wide level and untimbered plains which streach themselves along their bases for an immence distance (i e) that the air comeing in contact with the snow is suddonly chilled and condenced, thus becoming heaver than the air beneath in the plains, it glides down the sides of these mountains &amp; decends to the plains, where by the constant action of the sun on the face of an untimbered country there is a partial vacuum formed for it's reception. I have observed that the winds from this quarter are always the coldest and most violent which we experience, yet I am far from giving full credit to my own hypothesis on this subject; if hoever I find on the opposite side of these mountains that the winds take a contrary direction I shall then have more faith. <a href="#n16070201" id="ln16070201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> After I had completed my observation of Equal Altitudes today <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

outer part of the legs and head of a light lead colour, the belly and inner side of the legs white as were also the feet and years.    the toes were longer and the ears much larger than the common rat; the ears uncovered with hair.    the eyes were black and prominent the whiskers very long and full.    the tail was reather longer than the body and covered with fine fur or poil of the same length and colour of the back.    the fur was very silkey close and short. I have frequently seen the nests of these rats in clifts of rocks and hollow trees but never before saw one of them.    they feed very much on the fruit and seed of the prickly pear; or at least I have seen large quantities of the hulls of that fruit lying about their holes and in their nests.</p>
