               <h4>Summary of Route and Major Biological Discoveries</h4>
               <p>On April 27, 1805, the expedition left the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>
and probably passed the boundary of present-day <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> that same
day. The courses of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> and <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Rivers have changed
greatly in the past two centuries, leaving room for some doubt as to the exact
day the party reached what is now the eastern border of <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. They very
soon encountered large numbers of deer, elk, bison, wolves, and grizzly bears.
They reached "<span class="tei_name">Martha's River</span>" (now the <span class="tei_name">Big Muddy River</span>) on April 29 and the
"<span class="tei_name">Porcupine River</span>" (now the <span class="tei_name">Poplar River</span>) on May 3. The <span class="tei_name">Milk River</span> was reached
on May 8 and the <span class="tei_name">Musselshell</span> on May 20. "<span class="tei_name">Judith's River</span>" (now the <span class="tei_name">Judith River</span>)
was passed on May 29 and the mouth of "<span class="tei_name">Maria's River</span>" (now simply spelled
the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>) on June 2, 1805.</p>
               <p>A major geographic discovery, the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls of the Missouri River</span>, was
reached on June 16, 1805. At that point a major portage was needed, and it was
not until July 15 that the party was able to get under way again. <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span>
and his small advance party reached the <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> region on July 25,where the
<span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span>, <span class="tei_name">Madison</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Gallatin</span> Rivers (all named by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>) merge
to form the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. It was also near here that <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> had been captured
five years previously. At <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> the expedition had reached an elevation
of slightly more than 4,000 feet and was at the very western edge of the <span class="tei_name">Great
Plains</span>. The rest of the group arrived the 17th, and after three more days of local
exploration they set off again. Following the westernmost branch (<span class="tei_name">Jefferson
River</span>) upstream, the expedition soon was in the heart of the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>
and about to cross the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span>.</p>
               <p>The route of the return trip across <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> is complicated by the fact that
the expedition split into several parties after crossing the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span> at
<span class="tei_name">Lolo Pass</span>, west of present-day <span class="tei_name">Missoula</span>. From <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span> camp (about 20
miles south of <span class="tei_name">Missoula</span>) <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> and a group of 20 men, plus <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>
and her son, began traveling southward on July 3, progressively making their
way past the sites of present-day <span class="tei_name">Hamilton</span> and <span class="tei_name">Jackson</span>. On July 8 they reached
the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead River</span> somewhat above the location of present-day <span class="tei_name">Dillon</span>, where
they found their cache of supplies as well as their canoes. From there they moved
downstream to <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, arriving July 13, 1806. Ten members of <span class="tei_name">Captain
Clark's</span> group were then sent via canoes from <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> to <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, to
begin the arduous portage around the falls and rapids.</p>

                  <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> and his remaining 12-person contingent (10 men plus <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>
and her 17-month-old son, <span class="tei_name">Baptiste</span>) and their horses moved overland
across <span class="tei_name">Bozeman Pass</span> and reached the upper <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone ("Rochejhone") River</span>
near the present site of <span class="tei_name">Livingston</span> on July 15, 1806. There the trees were not large
enough to make canoes, so they continued downstream. At the approximate
site of present-day <span class="tei_name">Columbus</span> the group stopped long enough to manufacture
two dugout canoes from cottonwoods and then resumed water travel on July
24. They gradually made their way down the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>, making a short stop
on July 25 at a sandstone promontory that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> named "<span class="tei_name">Pompy's Tower</span>" in
honor of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea's</span> son, whom <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had nicknamed <span class="tei_name">Pompy</span>. There <span class="tei_name">Captain
Clark</span> inscribed his own name and the date. In that general vicinity they saw
a large herd of bighorns as well as flocks of geese and pigeons. They arrived at
the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> on August 3, 1806, thus finally leaving present-day
eastern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> and again passing into what is now western <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>.</p>
               <p>From <span class="tei_name">Travelers' Rest</span> camp, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> and his group of nine men (and
five guides) independently set forth in a northeasterly direction on July 3, 1806,
for <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, arriving at the river after a hard march of eight days. He left six
of his party at <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> to assist <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ten-man contingent with the downstream
portaging, and with his remaining three handpicked men headed on
July 16 for a brief reconnaissance of the <span class="tei_name">Marias ("Maria's") River</span>. On their way
north, they sequentially crossed the <span class="tei_name">Sun River ("Medicine River")</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Teton
River</span>. After reaching the <span class="tei_name">Marias</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> doggedly followed it northwest to a point
about 20 miles west of present-day <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank</span>, along a northern tributary, <span class="tei_name">Cut
Bank Creek</span>. He was searching for the northernmost limits of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri's</span>
drainage, and thus the possible northernmost legal limits of the Louisiana Purchase.
By July 22 he was within sight of the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, but the river had
still not turned north, and several days of bad weather had made it impossible
for him to establish his exact location. After turning back south and crossing
<span class="tei_name">Two Medicine River</span> (the <span class="tei_name">south fork of Maria's River</span> in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> terminology),
the exploration ended abruptly on July 27 when eight <span class="tei_name">Piegan Blackfoot</span> men,
with whom they had held a peaceful council the day before, tried to steal the
group's guns and horses. In the resulting fight one <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> man was killed
and another was evidently fatally wounded. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> himself was very narrowly
missed by a musket ball. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his men quickly retreated and again reached
the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> near the present site of <span class="tei_name">Virgelle</span> on July 28. The site of this
harrowing encounter is on private land about 15 miles northeast of present-day
<span class="tei_name">Valier</span>.</p>
               <p>The group of six men who had been left by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> to negotiate the
<span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> portage was soon met by the ten others who had been sent downstream
by <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark</span> from <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span> to help with the portaging. After
negotiating the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> portage, the 16 men continued downstream. By the
greatest of good luck, they encountered <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and his three-man party just as
they were returning to the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> on July 28. The reunited
group of 20 men then descended the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> under the leadership of <span class="tei_name">Captain
Lewis</span>, reaching the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> and arriving at the approximate
present-day boundary of <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> on August 7, 1806, only four days
behind <span class="tei_name">Captain Clark's</span> group that had come via the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>. Thus the last
members of the Corps of Discovery departed from what is now <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.</p>

                     <p>In <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, bighorns were reported from at least 15 locations, and at least
35 were killed during the entire expedition. As noted previously, bighorn sheep
were first observed at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> in extreme western
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> and were subsequently seen as far west as the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead Mountains</span>
in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. In one location below the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> the party
killed nine sheep in a single day. None was seen along the upper <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>
by <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>. The bighorn was formally described and named in 1804. The
species still ranges widely in the American and Canadian <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>, and
the poorly characterized race <em class="hi">O. c. auduboni</em> historically inhabited the upper
<span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> from <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> to <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> at the time of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
expedition. It was first distinguished subspecifically from the more widespread
<span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountain</span> form in 1901. The last state record for native bighorns in <span class="tei_name">North
Dakota</span> was in 1905, for <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> in about 1915, and for <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> in 1918.
Reintroduced bighorns of the nearly identical <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountain</span> race now occur
in <span class="tei_name">Nebraska's</span>

present-day <span class="tei_name">Billings</span> to the <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> boundary. After the great bison
slaughter of the middle and late nineteenth century, when more than 40 million
animals were destroyed, the only remaining bison south of <span class="tei_name">Canada</span> were a few
hundred individuals that were protected in <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone National Park</span>. From
these and from some small captive herds the present population of several hundred
thousand bison has been produced.</p>

                     <p>The bushy-tailed woodrat was first accurately described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>,
but the species was not formally named until 1815. They encountered it in the
vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> on July 2, 1805, and captured a live specimen. <span class="tei_name">Captain
Lewis</span> described it with care, noting that he had often seen the animals' dens in
cliff and tree hollows, and that they often eat the fruits and seeds of the prickly
pear (<em class="hi">Opuntia sp</em>.). Woodrats, more generally known as "packrats," accumulate
caches of food items such as cactus fruits, acorns, pine cones, bones, and even
inedible objects such as small plastic items and other miscellaneous "treasures"
that they happen to find in the vicinities of their nests. It is now known that
bushy-tailed woodrats extend east into the western Dakotas, and a few decades
after <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> expedition Prince Maximilian found them to be present
at both <span class="tei_name">Fort Clark</span> and <span class="tei_name">Fort Union</span>.</p>

                     <p>Lewis and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made many observations of the Columbian ground squirrel
on the western slope of the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>, but only a few apply to the extreme western
<span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>. In July of 1806 <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> encountered this species in the upper <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot
Valley</span>, and during <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> independent survey of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> region
during the same month he encountered these animals east of present-day <span class="tei_name">Missoula</span>
and on the <span class="tei_name">Cut Bank branch of the Marias River</span>. The Columbian ground
squirrel was first described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> on the basis of specimens they
obtained in <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>, but it was not given a formal Latin name until 1815. This
species is primarily associated geographically with the <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span> Basin
much farther to the west.</p>

                     <p>At a minimum, coyotes were encountered near <span class="tei_name">Wolf Point</span> and on the upper
<span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, but they were evidently much less common than gray
wolves there and were only rarely mentioned. They became much more common
everywhere after the disappearance of gray wolves from the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>,
and have gradually extended their range eastward to the <span class="tei_name">Atlantic</span> coast. In spite
of massive poisoning and other control efforts, the coyote has thrived better
than any other native American dog or cat.</p>

                     </strong>
                     <p>In <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, elk were reported from at least 37 locations, from around the
present-day <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> boundary west along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley to its <span class="tei_name">Three
Forks</span> headwaters, in the mountains to the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Valley</span>, and along the entire
<span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> Valley. They were also seen along the <span class="tei_name">Sun River</span> and in the <span class="tei_name">Marias
River</span> valley near present-day <span class="tei_name">Shelby</span>. They were especially numerous along the
<span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>, where herds of up to 200 were apparently common. They are
still locally common in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> but are mainly confined to forested areas and
sanctuaries. Elk were eliminated from <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> and <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> by the early
1880s and from <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> by 1888. Restoration efforts have occurred in all
three states, and small, mostly confined herds exist in them.</p>

                     <p>Wolves were especially common in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, where they were reported from
at least 17 locations, and the herds of bison were regularly "attended by their
shepherds the wolves." Near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Sun ("Medicine") River</span>
                        <span class="tei_name">Captain
Lewis</span> noted that most of the wolves seen around a bison carcass "were of the
large kind." Gray wolves were eventually extirpated from <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, but recent
releases in the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone Park</span> area have restored them to the state's faunal list.
They have since been seen as far south and east as <span class="tei_name">Wyoming's</span>

                     <strong>Grizzly Bear <em class="hi">Ursus arctos</em>
                     </strong>
                     <p>During the 1805 ascent up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> grizzlies were seen by expedition
members at no fewer than 17 locations, and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also mentioned them at three
locations during his survey of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> valley. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> likewise saw them at
least twice as he traveled down the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> Valley. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> referred
to grizzly bears under various names, including the "white bear," "brown bear,"
and "grizly bear." <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> eventually concluded that all these color variants
were "of the same species only differing in color from age or more properly
from the same natural cause than many other anamals of the same family differ

species ("<em class="hi">Ursus ferox</em>") until 1815, based on the descriptions and specimens of
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Raymond Burroughs calculated that at least 43 grizzly bears
were killed over the entire expedition period, most of them in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. Twenty
three were killed between the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> and <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.
Ten were killed in the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> alone, and 14 were killed
during the separate return trips of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> down the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> and
<span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Rivers of <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. Every shooting of a grizzly was a highly risky undertaking.
One enormous 600-pound male required ten shots to bring it down.
On May 14 six men set out to kill a grizzly bear. Although all six lead balls hit the
bear, it attacked, and only after two more bullets struck it, one in the head, did
it finally collapse, just before reaching its closest human target. <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> now
has one of the very few remaining populations of grizzly bears south of <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>,
with perhaps 500 to 1,000 surviving in the northern <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span> of the United States
and <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>, centering on the Glacier-Banff-Jasper ecosystem. There are a few
left in the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone Park</span> ecosystem, and they range east and south locally to
<span class="tei_name">Wyoming's</span>

                     <p>A few encounters with mountain lions occurred while the expedition was
still on the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>. On May 16, between the <span class="tei_name">Milk</span> and <span class="tei_name">Musselshell</span> Rivers,
a mountain lion ("panther") was shot and wounded, but it escaped. One was
killed on the <span class="tei_name">Jefferson River</span> on August 3, 1805, and a few days later three deerskins
disappeared from camp and were judged to have been stolen by a mountain
lion. In spite of continuous persecution ever since, mountain lions have
somehow survived in the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span> and <span class="tei_name">Black Hills</span> regions. Occasionally
stray animals still wander east into <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> and eastern <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> and
<span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>, usually with fatal results to the cats. Their prime prey, mule deer
and white-tailed deer, have vastly increased in the absence of large predators
such as wolves and mountain lions, but the increased human population has
had little tolerance for mountain lions, and most that stray into the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>
are quickly killed.</p>

to about <span class="tei_name">Wolf Point</span>, and mule deer from that point west up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley
to the <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountains</span>. In recent years white-tailed deer have been increasing
relative to mule deer in the western <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span> and are now as common as

little attention was paid to them. However, Native Americans prized their fur,

with only one coyote reference and 17 locations where wolves were mentioned.
Red foxes and swift foxes have both generally suffered in recent decades,

                     <strong>Swift Fox <em class="hi">Vulpes velox</em> FIG. 32</strong>
                     <p>The swift fox was first recognized as a distinct species by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
but was not formally described and scientifically named until 1823. It was first
encountered on July 6, 1805, in the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>. At that time <span class="tei_name">Captain
Lewis</span> referred to the animal as a "remarkable small fox." Two days later
one was shot, and it was carefully described by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. He noted its remarkably
long claws, and later (July 26) mentioned the black tip of its tail, another
distinguishing features of the species. This high plains species is now barely
surviving in <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, the Dakotas, and eastern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, with very few recent
records for any of these states. There are only two <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span> records
since 1976 (<span class="tei_name">Mercer</span> and <span class="tei_name">Golden Valley</span> Counties), and four southwestern <span class="tei_name">South
Dakota</span> counties have recent records. There may also be some swift foxes left
in the nearby <span class="tei_name">Oglala National Grassland</span> of northwestern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> and in <span class="tei_name">Nebraska's</span>
                        <span class="tei_name">Box Butte County</span>, where some were photographed in 2001. Perhaps
some also survive in the extreme southwestern counties of <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> near the
<span class="tei_name">Pawnee National Grassland</span> of adjacent <span class="tei_name">Colorado</span>, where they are known to occur.
Swift foxes are easily trapped, and in most areas have lost prairie dogs as
part of their food base.</p>

it. The thirteen-lined ground squirrel was not formally described and
named until 1821. It is still one of the most commonly seen and widespread
rodents of the northern plains, and is a major food for coyotes, badgers, and
other grassland predators. Like other ground squirrels, it is dormant for more
than half of the year, which may reduce predation levels.</p>

                     <p>There is no doubt as to the identity of the bird shot on May 1, 1805, about 75
miles above the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span>. It was carefully described by
<span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span>, who incorrectly believed it new to science. He called it the "Missouri
plover." Avocets are still fairly widespread in the more alkaline wetlands
of western North America; their uniquely recurved bills are mainly used for
extracting small invertebrates from the surface of water by a kind of lateral scything
action.</p>

                        <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also mentions seeing goldfinches among the birds singing along the
<span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> on June 8, 1805. He was apparently quite familiar with
this widespread woodland-and-edge species and gave it no special attention.
Goldfinch populations have declined significantly in the past four decades.</p>

                     <p>In the expedition's Meteorological Register of May 23, 1805, it was noted that
a kingfisher was first seen seasonally near present-day <span class="tei_name">Fort Peck</span>. It was also seen
near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> (July 11-13, 1805). This distinctive bird is still common along
relatively clear rivers supporting small fishes. Belted kingfisher populations have
declined significantly in North America during the last four decades, probably
as a result of increased levels of water pollution.</p>

                     <strong>Brown-headed Cowbird <em class="hi">Molothrus ater</em>

                     </strong>
                     <p>Few specific notes were made on these presumably common and probably
widespread species, which are adapted to forage at the feet of large ungulates
such as bison. In the expedition's Meteorological Register of May 17, 1805, it
was noted that "large and small blackbirds" had returned to eastern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.
Elliott Coues identified these as most probably brown-headed cowbirds and
Brewer's blackbirds. Probable cowbirds were also seen near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> (July 11-
13, 1805, and July 11, 1806), and this species (referred to by the explorers as the
"buffalo-pecker") must have regularly associated with bison before domestic
cattle appeared on the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>. Cowbird populations are now declining
nationally, but they still pose a serious threat to native songbirds because of their
parasitic nesting behavior. Brewer's blackbird populations have also declined
significantly rangewide.</p>

                     <p>On May 31, 1805, in what is now <span class="tei_name">Chouteau County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> saw a
group of what he called "small martin" building globular nests of clay on a cliff
wall. These could only have been cliff swallows, which now widely nest on vertical
manmade structures, such as the sides of concrete bridges.</p>

                     <p>On June 30, 1805, near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> shot a bird he
identified as a species of goatsucker, reporting that it was identical to those
of the Atlantic states, "where it is called the large goat-sucker or night hawk."
Nighthawks, whip-poor-wills, and poorwills are aerial insect-eaters; their extremely
large mouths are responsible for their colorful if erroneous vernacular
name "goatsuckers." Common nighthawk populations have declined significantly in North America during the last four decades, as have other goatsuckers.</p>

                     <p>Few specific notes were made on these rather conspicuous songbird species,
and not enough information was offered to distinguish which kingbird species
was seen. In the expedition's Meteorological Register of May 25, 1805, it was
noted that the "king-bird or bee-martin" had returned seasonally to the vicinity
of the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Musselshell River</span>. Kingbirds are rather late spring arrivals
in the northern United States, as they winter in tropical America. The eastern
species is more likely to have been seen than the western, since the eastern would
have been the one familiar to the explorers and would not have attracted special
attention. Also, it is more often found closer to water than the more arid-adapted
western species. Kingbirds of undetermined species were also noted
on June 10, 1805, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>, and on August 2, 1806,
near present-day <span class="tei_name">Missoula</span>. The eastern kingbird's rangewide population has
declined significantly during the past four decades.</p>

                     <strong>Greater Sage-grouse <em class="hi">Centrocercus urophasianus</em> FIG. 34</strong>
                     <p>One of the species definitely discovered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> is this large sage-adapted
grouse. It was first seen on June 5, 1805, near the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>,
when an attempt to kill one was unsuccessful. Others were seen at <span class="tei_name">Lemhi Pass</span> in the <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead Mountains</span> on August 12 of that year, but it was not until
October 17 that several were actually shot. Both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> provided detailed
descriptions of the species, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> calling it the "prarie cock" and <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>
the "cock of the plains." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also first described the species' unusual saclike
gizzard, describing it as more like a "maw" (crop) than a typical muscular grinding
organ. He said this grouse feeds almost entirely on the "pulpy leafed thorn,"
presumably confusing the relatively inedible black greasewood with the bird's
actual primary (almost sole) food, the highly nutritious leaves of big sagebrush
(<em class="hi">Artemisia tridentata</em>). John J. Audubon used <span class="tei_name">Lewis's'</span> suggested name "cock of
the plains" when he painted the species about three decades later. Greater sage-grouse
populations have plummeted in recent decades, as the West's once-vast
areas of native sagebrush have been progressively cleared.</p>

                     <p>One of the major ornithological discoveries of the expedition was <span class="tei_name">Captain
Lewis's</span> discovery of the woodpecker that now bears his name. On July 20, 1805,
along <span class="tei_name">Prickly Pear Creek</span> and near present-day <span class="tei_name">Helena</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> first saw
a "black woodpecker (or crow)." He judged it to be about the size of a flicker
but as black as a crow. He was not able to obtain a specimen until May of 1806,
when in <span class="tei_name">Idaho</span> the expedition members "killed and preserved several." He then
provided a highly detailed description of the bird, and at least one of the preserved
specimens made its way back east, where it eventually ended up in the
hands of <span class="tei_name">Charles W. Peale</span>, curator of the <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia Museum</span> housed in <span class="tei_name">Independence
Hall</span>. The specimen that <span class="tei_name">Alexander Wilson</span> used to illustrate the
species for the first time was one of those collected by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and it
was named "Lewis's woodpecker." <span class="tei_name">Wilson's</span> original sketches of this woodpecker
and of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> nutcracker (<em class="hi">Nucifraga columbiana</em>), similarly named after <span class="tei_name">Captain
Clark</span>, are still present in the Academy of Natural Sciences of <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span>.
Like the red-headed woodpecker, the Lewis's woodpecker is distinctly migratory
and often occurs well away from dense woods. Its population numbers have not
changed significantly in the past four decades.</p>

                        <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> discovered the nest and eggs of the loggerhead shrike on June
10, 1805, near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. He described it in
considerable detail, thinking the species might be new to science. However, it
later was recognized as an undescribed subspecies of an already known species.
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> noted the shrike's hawklike claws and judged it to be a predator of insects.
It is now known to prey also on a wide variety of animals, including both small
mammals and birds. It is characteristic of open, often arid, country. Loggerhead shrike populations have declined significantly in North America during the last
four decades.</p>

a sparrow-sized bird taking flight, singing, and then dropping back to earth.
His detailed description leaves little doubt that he had observed the McCown's
longspur in its aerial territorial display. This species was not officially described
and named until 1851,more than four decades later. It is a typical species of arid
shortgrass prairies, and its population appears to be declining rangewide.</p>

only to female or immature male mergansers and would also fit the common

the vicinity of <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, as well as near the present-day locations of <span class="tei_name">Helena</span>
(July 20, 1805), Townsend (July 24, 1805), and Whitehall (August 2, 1805). They
are largely confined to fairly clear streams that permit visual hunting for fish,

                     <p>Few specific notes were made on this common and well-known species. In
the expedition's Meteorological Register of May 8, 1805, it was noted that the

seen near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span> on June 8, 1805. On the return trip of
1806 it was observed near the present-day locations of <span class="tei_name">Missoula</span> and <span class="tei_name">Billings</span>,
near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>, and on the upper <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>. Mourning dove populations

8, 1805, a bird name that has sometimes been associated with the pine siskin.

                     <p>Few notes were made on this common and widespread species. In the expedition's Meteorological
Register of May 28, 1805, it was noted that a "small black

It was also seen July 16, 1806, near <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> and near present-day <span class="tei_name">Fort Peck</span>
on August 3, 1806. Unlike some similar-sized woodpeckers such as the downy

                     <p>The first mention of sandhill cranes by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> came on July 15, 1805, in the
vicinity of the <span class="tei_name">Gates of the Rocky Mountains</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, where several examples
of the "large brown or Sandhill crain" were seen leading young. A living young
bird was also brought into camp on July 19, 1805, near <span class="tei_name">Three Forks</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.
Lewis eventually released it. Greater sandhill cranes (<em class="hi">Grus canadensis tabida</em>)
continue to survive in the northern <span class="tei_name">Rocky Mountain</span> region and have been increasing
both regionally and nationally in recent decades as a result of long-term

                     <p>On July 22, 1805, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> reported seeing "a species of small curlooe
of a brown color" at present-day <span class="tei_name">Canyon Ferry</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. This bird was tentatively
identified by Rueben Thwaites as a mountain plover, but Elliott Coues
instead believed that it might have been an upland sandpiper. Either species
would be geographically possible, but the sandpiper, which is somewhat more
curlewlike than the plover and is more widespread, would seem the more likely
possibility. Descriptive terms such as curlew (spelled variously) and plover were
evidently used rather indiscriminately for shorebirds by expedition members,
with curlew perhaps usually applied to the longer-billed or larger species. Too
little information is available to make an informed guess as to the identity of this
particular bird. The mountain plover's population has declined to the point that
it is now a federally endangered species, whereas the population of the upland
sandpiper has increased slightly during the past four decades, one of the very
few grassland-adapted bird species that has shown this trend.</p>

                     <p>This species was collected on May 9, 1805, at the site of present-day <span class="tei_name">Fort Peck</span>,
<span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> described this bird with some care and detail, incorrectly
thinking it might be new to science, and he especially noted its resemblance
to the "large grey plover" or "Jack Curloo." He described the bird's wings
as white, tipped with black, making identification of this distinctive species
fairly certain. Like avocets, willets are still fairly common in the more alkaline
wetlands of western North America.</p>

timber rattlesnakes (<em class="hi">Crotalus horridus</em>), but the later encounters on the
high plains of the <span class="tei_name">Dakotas</span> and <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> most likely involved the somewhat

later encountered rattlesnakes at least a dozen times on the plains of <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>,
including several near escapes from being bitten. The western rattlesnake

them excellent candidates for manufacturing dugout canoes. Ten of the 15 dugout

                     <p>This species and wild rice are the only grasses represented in the <span class="tei_name">Great Plains</span>
collections of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and surprisingly few other grasses were collected
farther west. It is a common perennial species of mixed-grass prairies. Collected
July 8, 1806, in <span class="tei_name">Lewis and Clark County</span> or <span class="tei_name">Beaverhead County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>.</p>

                     <strong>Red False (Scarlet Globe) Mallow <em class="hi">Sphaeralcea coccinea</em>
                     </strong>
                     <p>This is a widespread perennial forb. The <span class="tei_name">Blackfoot</span> used a paste made from
chewing the plant stems and leaves as an external medicine for burns and sores.
The <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span> similarly made a paste to rub over their hands and arms, thus
seemingly making them immune to the effects of scalding water. The "contrary
medicine men" of the <span class="tei_name">Lakotas</span> used this purported protective trait to impress
onlookers and encourage faith in their apparent special powers. Collected July
20, 1806, probably in present-day <span class="tei_name">Toole County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. A newly discovered
species.</p>

                     <strong>Snow-on-the-Mountain <em class="hi">Euphorbia marginata</em>
                     </strong>
                     <p>This is a widespread perennial forb on dry grasslands. Its leaves are somewhat
poisonous, but they were used by the <span class="tei_name">Dakotas</span> as a basis for medicinal tea,
which was used to treat mothers producing insufficient milk, and its crushed
leaves were also used in warm water to make a kind of liniment. However, exposure
of the skin to the milky sap can also cause severe inflammation. Collected
July 28, 1806, along the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone River</span> and in what is now <span class="tei_name">Rosebud County</span>,
<span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. A newly discovered species.</p>
