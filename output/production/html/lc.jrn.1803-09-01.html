               <p> The Pilott informed me that we were not far from a ripple which was much worse than any we
      had yet passed, and as there was so thick a fogg on the face of the water that no object was
      visible 40 paces he advised remaining untill the sun should acquire a greater altitude when
      the fogg would asscend and disappear; I conscented; we remained untill eight Oclock this
      morning when we again set out—    these Foggs are very common on
      the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> at this season of the year as also in the
      spring but do not think them as freequent or thick in the spring.    perhaps
      this may in some measure assist us to account for the heavy dues which are mor remarkable for
      their freequency and quantity than in any country I was ever in—
         they are so heavy the drops falling from the trees from about midknight
      untill sunrise gives you the eydea of a constant gentle rain, this continues untill the sun
      has acquired sufficient altitude to dessipate the fogg by it's influence, and it then ceases.
         the dues are likewise more heavy during summer than elsewhere but not so
      much so as at this season.—    the Fog appears to owe it's orrigin
      to the difference of temperature between the <em class="hi">air</em> and <em class="hi">water</em> the latter at this seson being much warmer than the former; the water being
      heated by the summer's sun dose not undergo so rapid a change from the absence of the sun as
      the air dose consiquently when the air becomes most cool which is about sunrise the fogg is
      thickest and appears to rise from the face of the water like the steem from boiling
       water— <a href="#n02090101" id="ln02090101" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    we passed the <em class="hi">little horsetale</em> ripple or riffle with much deficulty, all hands laboured

     reflections on fog and dew and their determinants over the next several days bring him to posit
     a theory for the occurrence and to test his hypothesis by taking temperature readings of air
     and river during the time. Apparently cold air is moving down the valley sides and passing
     across the warm water of the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> in a
     situation known as cold air drainage. Since the air is heated from below as well as moistened,
     the fog takes the form of rising streamers, and the phenomenon is generally called steam fog.
