            <div class="footnote" id="n25111301">1. Sitka spruce, as noted on November 4; it is the dominant species of this region. The Sitka spruce vegetation zone is a narrow coastal temperate rain forest, generally only a few miles in width except where it extends up river valleys. It has a uniform wet and mild climate with rich soils. The forests are dense, tall, and among the most productive in the world. The three most common trees are Sitka spruce, western hemlock, <em class="hi">Tsuga heterophylla</em> (Raf.) Sarg., and western redcedar. Douglas fir and grand fir are also important. The mature forests have lush understories with dense growth of shrubs, herbs, ferns, and mosses. Hitchcock et al., 1:132–33; Franklin &amp; Dyrness, 58–59; Cutright (LCPN), 239.
