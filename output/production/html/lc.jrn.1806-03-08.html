The white brant <a href="#n28030801" id="ln28030801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is very common in this country particularly below tidewater where they remain in vast quantities during the winter.    they feed like the swan gees &amp;c on the grass roots and seeds which they find in the marshes.    this bird is about the size of the brown brant <a href="#n28030802" id="ln28030802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> or a third less than the common Canadian or wild goose. <a href="#n28030803" id="ln28030803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    the head is proportionably with the goose reather large; the beak also thicker shorter and of much the same form, being of a yellowish white colour except the edges of the chaps, which are frequently of a dark brown.    the legs and feet are of the same form of the goose and are of a redish white or pale flesh colour.    the tail is composed of sixteen feathers of equal length as those of the geese and brown brant are and bears about the same proportion in point of length. the eye is of a dark colour and nothing remarkable as to size.    the wings are rether longer compared with those of the goose but not as much so as in the brown or pided brant.    the colour of the plumage of this bird is unifomly a pure white except the large feathers of the extremities of the wings which are black.    the large feathers of the 1st joint of the wing next to the body are white.    the note of this bird differs essentially from that of the goose; it more resembles that of the brown brant but is somewhat different.    it is like the note of young domestic goose which has not perfectly attainted it's full note.    the flesh of this bird is exceedingly fine, preferable to either the goose or pided brant.— The Brown or pided brant are much the same size and form of the white only that their wings are considerably longer and more pointed.    the plumage of the upper part of the body neck head and tail is much the colour of the canadian goose but reather darker in consequence of som dark brown feathers which are distributed and irregularly scattered throughout.    they have not the white on the neck and sides of the head as the goose has nor is the neck darker than the body.    like the goose there are some white feathers on the rump at the joinging of the tail.    the beak is dark and the legs and feet also dark with a greenish cast; the breast and belley are of a lighter colour than the back and is also irregularly intermixed with dark brown and black feathers which give it a pided appearance.    the flesh of this bird is dark and in my estimation reather better than that of the goose. the habits of this bird are the same nearly with the goose and white brant with this difference that they do not remain in this climate in such numbers during the winter as the others, and that it sets out earlier in the fall season on it's return to the south and arrives later in the spring than the goose. I see no difference between this bird and that called simply the brant, common to the lakes <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">the Ohio</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> &amp;c.

I have now no hesitation in declaring them a distinct speceis.    the large goose is the same of that common on the <a class="regularization" title="Atlantic Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast, and known by the appellation of the wild, or Canadian goose.

The <span class="italic">White Brant</span> is very common in this country particularly below tide water where they remain in vast quantities dureing the winter.    they feed like the Swan Goose &amp;c. on the grass and roots &amp; Seeds which they find in the marshes    this bird is a little larger than the brown brant and a fourth less than the common wild or Canadian goose.    the head is proportionably with the goose reather large; the beak thicker Shorter and of the Same form, being of a yellowish white colour except the edges of the Chaps, which are frequently of a dark brown.    the legs and feet are of the Same form of the goose and are of a redish white or pail flesh colour.    the tail is composed of Sixteen feathers of equal length as those of the geese and brown brant are, and bears about the Same perpotion in point of length.    the Eye is of a dark colour and nothing remarkable as to Size.    the wings are reather longer compared with those of the goose, but not as much So as is the brown or pieded brant.    the colour of the plumage of this bird is uniformly a pure white except the large feathers of the extremities of the wings which are black. The large feathers of the 1st joint of the wing next to the body are white.    the note of this bird differs essentially from that of the goose; it more resembles that of the brown brant but is Somewhat different.    it is like the note of a young domestic goose which has not perfectly attained its full note.    the flesh of this bird is exceedingly fine, prefferable to either the goose or pieded brant, the neck is Shorter in prpotion than that of the goose.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="italic">Brown</span> or <span class="italic">pieded brant</span> are nearly the Size and much the Same form of the white brante only that their wings are considerably longer and more pointed.    the plumage of the upper part of the body, neck, head and tail is much the Colour of the Common or Canadian Goose but rather darker in consequence of Some dark brown feathers which are distributed and irregularly scattered throughout.    they have not the white on the neck and Sides of the head as the goose has nor is the neck darker than the body.    like the goose there are Some white feathers on the rump at the junction of the tail.    the beak, legs and feet are dark, with a greenish cast; the breast and belly are of a lighter colour than the back and is also intermixed, irregularly, with dark brown and black feathers which gives it a pieded appearance.    the flesh of this bird is dark, and in my estimation reather better than that of the goose.    the habits of this bird is nearly the same with the goose and white brant, with this difference that they do not remain in this Climate in Such numbers dureing the winter as the others. I See no difference between this bird and that Called Simpilly the <span class="italic">Brant</span> Common to the Lakes and frequently Seen on <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">the Ohio</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> in large flocks &amp;c.</p>
