This day I discovered how the Indians keep their horses during the winter. In the day time they are permitted to run out and gather what they can; and at night are brought into the lodges, with the natives themselves, and fed upon cotton wood branches: and in this way are kept in tolerable case. <a href="#n09010202" id="ln09010202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
