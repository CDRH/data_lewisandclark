            <div class="section  tei_div">
               <p>The winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> their first extended opportunity to fulfill one of the expedition's most important objectives. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> had instructed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> in June 1803 to gather, record, and analyze a vast amount of information about the Indians in the West and Pacific Northwest. Although <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> final document
did not quite match the complex set of questions about the Indians proposed by his scientific consultants, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had little doubt that their ethnographic assignment had a high priority. The captains understood that they were to do more than count native noses and list languages. From the beginning of the expedition, virtually every diarist in it diligently recorded all sorts of information about Indian life. But the demands of time and travel made thorough study difficult. It was not until the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> could seriously undertake studies in Indian ethnography.</p>
               <p>Disguised as travelers, traders, missionaries, and explorers, ethnographers were part of the American frontier from its earliest times. They recorded their impresssions of the strange and exotic cultures they encountered, often without fully realizing they were engaged in ethnographic study. These pioneer ethnographers described Indian life on a part-time basis, considering such activity incidental to their primary tasks. They included Jesuit missionaries in <span class="tei_name">Canada</span>, who studied Indian ways in order to save lost souls, and fur merchants, who noted native exchange systems to facilitate future trade operations. As part-time observers of native cultures, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> belonged to a long tradition in North America that included Father Paul Le Jeune, James Adair, Nicolas Perrot, and the captains' contemporaries <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry the Younger</span> and <span class="tei_name">Zebulon Pike</span>. Everything these men noted about the Indians—clothing, houses, village locations, languages, customs, and economy—they recorded in the service of business enterprise, government policy, or religious zeal. They made no pretense at being scientific observers. As valuable as they are, their ethnographic records are imperfect, incomplete pieces of evidence. It would be unreasonable to expect that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> painted a unified, coherent portrait of any Indian culture. They simply did not think in those terms. But they did leave behind journals and maps that comprise pieces of an intricate puzzle.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span>, and the other journalists in their party were ethnographers, not ethnologists. The distinction is important since it bears directly on how the explorers viewed their work and the results of it. Ethnologists study diverse cultures with an eye toward creating widely applicable concepts of social development and behavior. In this century they have become full-time specialists committed to accurate, objective observation.  <a href="#n0501" id="ln0501" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would have understood the modern desire for accuracy but not the passion for impartiality. Only rarely did they assume an air of cool detachment and scientific objectivity in their dealings
with the Indians. Disinterested observation was the farthest thing from their minds. Because the captains were confident of their own cultural superiority, they never doubted the wisdom of judging Indians by white standards. For <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, every observation was also a judgment. Those judgments are plain in the explorers' comments about the feisty <span class="tei_name">Teton</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and the sharp <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> traders. For instance, <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span> could not describe the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> practice of feeding buffalo skulls without pausing to damn native superstition.  <a href="#n0502" id="ln0502" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
But the captains' confidence did not often become swaggering arrogance—something that cannot be said for those who came later. Fortunately, their cultural biases did not prevent them from asking the right ethnographic questions. Equally fortunate, they had the good sense to write down most Indian answers, including many that seemed bewildering at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> began their ethnographic work at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> by simplifying and streamlining <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> detailed questions covering seventeen areas of Indian life and culture. Those questions touched on everything from language and law to trade and technology. The expedition was to record what the Indians wore, what they ate, how they made a living, and what they believed in. But long before coming to their winter quarters, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> realized that they would have neither the time nor the linguistic ability to ask all of <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> questions. Their "Estimate of
the Eastern Indians" contained nineteen questions that now seemed important to the expedition. Special attention was given to each Indian group's tribal name, location, population, language, and potential for American trade. Questions about religious traditions, medical practices, or cultural values were quietly dropped from the official list. This did not mean the expedition was unwilling to record that sort of data. During the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , journal entries noted creation myths, migration legends, burial practices, and sacred rituals. It does suggest that the captains very sensibly recognized their limitations during the winter and decided to use their time and resources to gather material on the externals of Indian life. They concentrated on how Indians looked but did not give systematic attention to native souls and psyches. Their commitment to externals can be seen in their treatment of Indian architecture. Although the expedition's record contains fine exterior descriptions of tepees, earth lodges, and plank houses, it has little to say about their interiors. Later, artists like Karl Bodmer, George Catlin, and Paul Kane would take us inside those houses.</p>
               <p>Time, circumstances, and talent limited the expedition's study of Indian subjects. The explorers were inquisitive about the world around them, and they had <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> methodical approach to guide them. But the Corps of Discovery was not quite prepared for the vast ethnographic enterprise proposed in the "Estimate." Relying on their good sense, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> used four techniques that had long been the mainstays of North American ethnography. First, the captains directly questioned both Indians and whites, often at great length. Second, they collected objects—everything from <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> corn and tobacco seeds to a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> buffalo skin painting. Third, they reported what could be concluded from firsthand observation. Occasionally, they obtained information a fourth way, by participating with the Indians in hunts, games, or ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Of the four methods used by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, interviews yielded the most valuable information. Since the fort was within easy walking distance of the two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, there were more <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> informants than <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> ones. Scores of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> men and women visited the expedition's quarters for all sorts of reasons, but when it came to ethnographic research the most welcome guests were <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, <span class="tei_name">Little Raven</span>, and two leading men from <span class="tei_name">Mitutanka</span>, <span class="tei_name">Big Man (Ohheenar)</span>, an adopted 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Coal (Shotaharrora)</span>, an adopted <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>. It was very important that these chiefs and "considerable men" be courted and closely questioned. For generations, chiefs and elders had served as tribal historians, committing to memory a whole body of past experience and tradition.  <a href="#n0503" id="ln0503" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Without the help of these men, the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ethnographic record would have been meager and unreliable. Of the two principal <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chiefs, <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> was the most valued by the expedition's ethnographers. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> characterized <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> as a man of "integrety, firmness, inteligence and perspicuety of mind."  <a href="#n0504" id="ln0504" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The chief made at least seventeen visits to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, some lasting many days. During those visits he often related "little Indian aneckd<sup>ts</sup>, [anecdotes]."  <a href="#n0505" id="ln0505" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> But like the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> traditions <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> dismissed as not worth mentioning, many pieces of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> history and belief shared by <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> were not recorded in the journals. Later in the voyage, when the captains had sharpened their ethnographic skills, they would now and then take time to preserve that sort of priceless detail.</p>
               <p>If there were plenty of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> informants, there were far fewer from the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages. As noted earlier, several factors limited the expedition's access to <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> information. Some <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs, including <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span>, were away on winter hunts. More important, there was lasting suspicion and hostility among the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>, especially in <span class="tei_name">Menetarra</span>, about the intentions and behavior of the American party. Many of them were alarmed by the expedition's weapons and the size of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Some elders resented what they called the captains' "High sounding language" and several warriors were angered by the explorers' boasts about American military might. Such tensions, often fueled by the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>s' malicious rumors, kept many <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> away from the fort and made them reluctant to entertain the captains at the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> villages.</p>
               <p>The simple fact was that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> desperately needed the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas'</span> information. The explorers knew that <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> (but not <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>) raiding parties ranged far west to the slopes of the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>. These parties could provide knowledge not only valuable for the second year of the expedition's travel but essential for its ethnographic assignment. Since <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> visitors to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> were few, those who did come were given special attention.
 <a href="#n0506" id="ln0506" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> They included <span class="tei_name">Tatuckcopinreha</span>, chief of the little <span class="tei_name">Awaxawi</span> village, and his neighbor the <span class="tei_name">Awatixa</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Black Moccasin</span>. On one occasion <span class="tei_name">Tatuckcopinreha</span> related "many strange accounts of his nation," but <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> recorded only the bare outlines of recent <span class="tei_name">Awaxawi</span> migrations.  <a href="#n0507" id="ln0507" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Notably absent for most of the winter were any <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span>-proper folk from <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne's</span> village. Not until the end of the season did the chief and one of his brothers pay court at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>—<span class="tei_name">Le Borgne</span> to hear about American diplomacy and his brother to repeat <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> words for an expedition vocabulary. Although the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> contacts were few, they did yield significant information. From them, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> learned about the size and locations of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , and <span class="tei_name">Blue Mud</span> (
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                  ) Indians.  <a href="#n0508" id="ln0508" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Without <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> cooperation, however grudgingly given, there would have been substantial gaps in the expedition's ethnography.</p>
               <p>Throughout the winter there were other important interviews with Indians who were neither 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   nor <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> brought in the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   band chief <span class="tei_name">Chechank, or Old Crane</span>, to talk with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, thereby expanding their knowledge of northern peoples and trade routes. There were also a number of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyennes</span>
                   in the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages who perhaps told the captains about tribes to the West and Southwest. And of course there was the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   woman <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, whose contribution is simply impossible to verify. It seems more likely that whatever <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew about the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                   came from <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> sources.  <a href="#n0509" id="ln0509" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>In all these talks the central problem remained language translation. <span class="tei_name">Charles Mackenzie</span>, a North West Company trader who lived in <span class="tei_name">Black Moccasin's</span> village during the winter of 1804–1805, left some vivid impressions of those difficulties in communicating. <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> recalled watching <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> struggle to record a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> vocabulary in which each word had to pass along a cumbersome translation chain stretching from a native speaker through <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, and on to members of the expedition. Heated arguments among the various translators were frequent, slowing the whole process and worrying many Indians. The way <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> remembered it, "The Indians could not well comprehend the intention of recording their words, [so] they concluded that the Americans had a wicked design on their country."  <a href="#n0510" id="ln0510" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Fortunately, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> encountered no such language barriers in their conversations with white traders living in the villages around <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. Traders and explorers spent a good deal of time with each other that winter, enjoying friendship and sharing information. Although there was some passing tension when North West Company employees were suspected of spreading anti-American rumors among the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> insisted that "we lived contentedly and became intimate with the gentlemen of the American expedition, who on all occasions seemed happy to see us, and always treated us with civility and kindness."  <a href="#n0511" id="ln0511" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Their specific ethnographic contributions cannot always be traced in the expedition's record, but it is plain that men like <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span>, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> provided much material for the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> 1805 map of western North America. The explorers were especially impressed with <span class="tei_name">Heney's</span> experience and knowledge. This trader had spent many years among Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and Upper <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> peoples and seemed quite ready to share his experience with the captains. They questioned him closely about Upper <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> tribes and the many 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   bands. <a href="#n0512" id="ln0512" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Heney's</span> imprint is clearly on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Chippewa</span>
                   sections of their "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." Other North West Company men like <span class="tei_name">Larocque</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mackenzie</span> offered their personal observations on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Cree Indians</span>. And despite his unsavory reputation, <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span> did have the kind of firsthand information the expedition needed. Some of the most valuable comments in the journals about <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> beliefs and intertribal relations came from him. <a href="#n0513" id="ln0513" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Because formal interviews demanded both time and translation, much ethnographic information came from personal observation. While always seeing and evaluating through non-Indian eyes, the Americans usually managed to record
what they witnessed with considerable accuracy. The expedition's ethnographers were especially interested in observing and setting down details of Indian material culture. What fascinated them were the ordinary things of Indian life—clothing, weapons, food, and houses. During the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> made important observations on Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> native life. A look at their distinctive contributions can help chart the growing sophistication of their ethnography.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> observation was sharpened by his growing skills as a frontier diplomat and negotiator. Although the future <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> superintendent of Indian affairs sometimes found time to record the presence of a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> sun dance post or a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> migration story, his real interest was what might be called political ethnography. He wanted to know who had formal political and military power, the ways that power was exercised, and how it was passed from generation to generation. Whenever possible, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> questioned both Indians and whites about native leadership. But when that was not possible, he relied on his own eyes. He carefully watched Indians such as <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> for clues in their behavior that might reveal the patterns of Indian polity.</p>
               <p>Interested in the etiquette of Indian politics and diplomacy, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> quickly recognized the role of tobacco and smoking in all decision-making. Tobacco was, he wrote, "an article indispenceable in those cases." <a href="#n0514" id="ln0514" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> When the explorer took part in discussions with chiefs and elders, he was careful to record the ritual procedures that dominated all native councils. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had been a perceptive political observer from
the beginning of the voyage, although in many cases his perceptions were not translated into diplomatic action. By the first winter, he had grasped the fundamentals of Indian diplomacy as well as any veteran of northern plains life. After visiting <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span> at the end of October 1804, he painstakingly described the protocol of the meeting with its rituals of smoking, proper seating, and the placing of a buffalo robe over his shoulders. <a href="#n0515" id="ln0515" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Behind <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> recording of such observations was an intensely practical motive. Future American diplomats in the West would need to know Indian ways just as the French and English had had to bend their diplomatic manners to suit the requirements of the <span class="tei_name">Hurons</span> and <span class="tei_name">Iroquois</span>. <a href="#n0516" id="ln0516" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Although there are many traces of <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> political observations scattered throughout his winter journal entries, his ability to understand native politics was best expressed in notes taken by <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span>. In answer to <span class="tei_name">Biddle's</span> general question about <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chiefs, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> offered a long summary of his political observations. "The throne of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  ," he explained, "generally descends from the chief to his son if he is able, or promises to be able to direct the military movements of warriors." Unlike so many other non-Indian observers, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not suggest that the "throne of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  " assumed some sort of coercive power over ordinary villagers. Grasping the essential reality of Indian leadership on the northern plains, he realized that "the power of the chief is rather the influence of character than the force of authority." <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found that chiefs could not become petty tyrants without incurring the disapproval of others equally powerful. "Power," he wrote, "is merely the acquiescence of the warriors in the superior merit of a chief " Extensive observation had taught him that Indian decisions on everything from war to individual transgressions were reached after careful, often time-consuming deliberation in council. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> told <span class="tei_name">Biddle</span>, "The chief does nothing without consulting the old men." He noted that the council was "formed not by appointment, but the most respectable old men are asked for their advice." <a href="#n0517" id="ln0517" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> observations and questions did not reveal that ownership of important tribal bundles as well as military prowess was essential for chiefs. And he did assume incorrectly that there was one <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> nation with a single Grand Chief. But those shortcomings aside, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> proved to be an astute observer of the chiefs, the councils, and the polity they represented. Unlike most Europeans who insisted on imposing their notions of coercive leadership on native cultures, he got the fundamentals right. <a href="#n0518" id="ln0518" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>If <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> observations were directed toward studying public politics, the sharp eyes of <span class="tei_name">Sergeant John Ordway</span> were consistently drawn to the commonplace in Indian life. <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> journal is filled with notes on those ordinary objects and actions that characterized Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian cultures. The sergeant was never systematic in his observations. He simply looked at and wrote about what seemed unusual or interesting to him. Blessed with an inquisitive mind, a good vocabulary, and a clear writing style, young <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> set down those telling details ignored by others. One of his habits throughout the journey was to do some informal exploring on his own, poking and probing around Indian villages to satisfy his curiosity. On one such jaunt early in the winter, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> examined and described <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> burial practices. With an accuracy that rivals George Catlin's later painting of the same subject, the explorer explained that "the form of these savages burying their dead is after they have deceased they fix a Scaffel on raised 4 forks about 8 or 10 feet from the ground." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> noted that corpses were wrapped in buffalo robes and placed on top of the burial scaffolds. Without mentioning the skull circles observed later by Catlin and Prince Maximilian, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> correctly noted the location of burial grounds outside village palisades. He also made a telling observation about Indian mourning practices: "When any of them loose a particklor friend or relation they morn and cry for some time after." <a href="#n0519" id="ln0519" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>On subsequent visits to <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> took note of Indian cooking and food preservation. The <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> diet of beans, corn, squash, and meat appealed to him, and in his simple style he reported that the Indians "live very well." Methods of storing food also attracted his attention. Villagers had long constructed elaborate underground bell-shaped food caches to preserve corn, beans, sunflower seeds, and dried squash over the winter. When <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> accompanied <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor's</span> detail assigned to obtain corn at <span class="tei_name">Black Cat's</span> village, he observed that large amounts of corn were taken out of the underground pit. <a href="#n0520" id="ln0520" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> most arresting ethnographic observation during the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   was a description of one of the most popular games played throughout Indian North America. Known as the game of hoop and pole, the sport
was found among almost every Indian group north of <span class="tei_name">Mexico</span>. Although there was considerable diversity in equipment and scoring, the game basically involved hurling a spear or shooting an arrow at a hoop or ring. Scoring depended on the accuracy of the strike toward the ring. Among the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villages the game called for a large cleared, level playing space, long sticks with thongs to catch in the target rings, and flat clay targets. Because the long throwing sticks looked like billiard cues, later white observers insisted that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> played billiards.</p>
               <p>On a cold, stormy day in mid-December 1804, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and two friends made their way to the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages for some corn trading. Despite the inclement weather, the Americans found a number of chiefs and warriors outside playing the
hoop and pole game. <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> wrote the following account of the game:
<span class="blockquote">They had feattish [flattish] rings made out of clay Stone &amp; two men had Sticks about 4 feet long with 2 Short peaces across the fore end of it, and neathing on the other end, in Such a manner that they would Slide Some distance. They had a place fixed across about 50 yards to the 2 chiefs lodge, which was Smothe as a house flour. They had a Battery fixed for the rings to Stop against. Two men would run at a time with Each a Stick &amp; one carried a ring. They run about half way and then Slide their Sticks after the ring.</span>

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> was interested enough to want to play the game, but his efforts were thwarted when he could not understand the scoring system. <a href="#n0521" id="ln0521" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a>

               <p>Even the most casual reader of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> record soon learns that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was the expedition's most skillful observer of Indian material culture. He probably kept a full journal during the winter, but only a few sheets of it have survived. <a href="#n0522" id="ln0522" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Those few scraps reveal an astute observer of Indian life. Three of his observations show his growing skill as an ethnographer.</p>
               <p>One entry concerns the brisk trade in war hatchets that developed between the villagers and the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> forge, which gave <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> an opportunity to study battle-axe styles used by the warriors. He described the weapon as a thin, iron blade "from 7 to nine iches in length and from 4 ¾ to 6 inches on its edge, from whence the sides proceed nearly in a straight line to the eye where its width is generally not more than an inch." Mounted on a handle some fourteen inches long, the whole weapon weighed about a pound. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> found the weapon's blow "uncertain and easily avoided." The American soldier was even less impressed with earlier versions of the instrument. This precise description of the axe was accompanied by a quick but accurate sketch of the weapon. <a href="#n0523" id="ln0523" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>In March 1805, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> had the chance to observe French trader <span class="tei_name">Joseph Gravelines</span> demonstrate an important Indian industrial process: the intricate means <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> craftsmen used to make glass beads. The Frenchman indicated that the <span class="tei_name">Arikaras</span> learned the skill from 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   prisoners, but <span class="tei_name">Tabeau</span> heard from his <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> friends that the process came to them from a "Spanish prisoner," perhaps an Indian held captive somewhere in the Southwest and traded up to the <span class="tei_name">Grand River</span> villages. As <span class="tei_name">Gravelines</span> went slowly through the steps, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> watched intently and probably took ample notes. From those notes and his own memory he was able to write a remarkably graphic and precise description of glass bead-making. That description included not only the steps in the process but the materials and equipment necessary for a successful result. Not satisfied with simply recounting the molding, firing, and tempering techniques, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also noted how the beads were used. "The Indians," he explained, "are extreemly fond of the large beads formed by this process. They use them as pendants to their years [ears], or hair and sometimes wear them about their necks." <a href="#n0524" id="ln0524" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> third ethnographic observation came at the end of the <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> season as the expedition was preparing for its second year of travel. To provide shelter for themselves, the interpreters, Sacagawea, and her child Jean Baptiste, the captains purchased a buffalo skin tepee. The expedition had seen tepees early in the journey among the Sioux bands; <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> now wrote one of the best descriptions yet drafted of that distinctive plains dwelling. <blockquote><p>This tent is in the Indian stile, formed of a number of dressed Buffaloe skins in such manner that when foalded double it forms the quarter of a circle, and is left open at one side. Here it may be attatached or loosened at pleasure by strings which are sewed to its sides for the purpose. To erect this tent, a parsel of ten or twelve poles are provided, fore or five of which are attatched together at one end, they are then elivated and their lower extremities are spread in a circular manner to a width proportionate to the demention of the lodge; in the same position orther poles are leant against those, and the leather is then thrown over them forming a conic figure. <a href="#n0525" id="ln0525" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
                  </p></blockquote> Sometimes burdened with an overblown vocabulary and an ornate style, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was nonetheless well on his way to becoming the expedition's premier ethnographer. He had neither <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> talent for political analysis nor <span class="tei_name">Ordway's</span> penchant for the homey detail. He did have the naturalist's ability to describe objects with almost photographic fidelity. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> brought to ethnography the practiced eye of one who delighted in describing and cataloging the creatures of the natural world.</p>
               <p>From their earliest travels in the Americas, Europeans collected and sometimes stole what seemed to them attractive Indian souvenirs. At first those artifacts were seen as mere curiosities, conversation pieces for princes and merchants. But by the eighteenth century such "cabinets of curiosities" had become the core of serious
scientific collections of ethnological specimens. <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> shared that impulse to assemble and analyze objects from cultures throughout the world. Just as the Royal Society instructed <span class="tei_name">Capt. James Cook</span> to gather representative samples of South Pacific material culture, so did <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> urge his captains to collect articles typical of Indian life along the route.</p>
               <p>Most of the expedition's collecting reflected <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> interest in natural history as well as <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> desire to catalog the plants, animals, and mineral resources of the newly acquired territories. Despite a focus on the land and its products, there was time to gather some Indian objects. On April 3, 1805, as the expedition was making
final preparations for leaving <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> drafted a list of all those specimens and samples sent back to <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> with <span class="tei_name">Warfington's</span> keelboat crew. Among the boxes, trunks, and cages were a number of objects illustrating Indian life. Knowing <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> interest in scientific agriculture, the explorers included a generous sample of the produce of Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> villagers. <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> tobacco seeds, a carrot of their distinctive tobacco, and an ear of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> corn were the captains' harvest for the gardener of <span class="tei_name">Monticello</span>. Clothing was also included in the Indian collection sent downriver. Four buffalo robes and "some articles of Indian dress" wrapped in a <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> robe were placed in the second numbered box to show the curious back home something of native fashion.</p>
               <p>That second box also contained the most arresting object collected during the winter. On a large buffalo skin a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> artist had portrayed in vivid detail a 1797 battle between <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>-
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   raiders and <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span>-<span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> warriors. Warfare was further represented by a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> bow and quiver of arrows. The bow is the only object in the assembly whose provenance can be traced in the expedition's journals. Early in February 1805, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> paid a social call on <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>. During the visit he was presented with a bow by the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief, most likely the same bow sent along
with some arrows in the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>-bound boxes. Rounding out the Indian collection was a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> clay pot "used for culinary purposes." <a href="#n0526" id="ln0526" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>A review of the Indian objects collected by the expedition reenforces the impresssion that the explorers were bent on studying the externals of native life. Weapons, clothing, pottery, seeds, and a skin depicting a battle all suggest what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> thought was important for understanding villager ways. Nothing was sent back to reveal the rich ceremonial life in <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> towns. For the pragmatic Americans more interested in natural resources than in supernatural practices, collecting seeds made more sense than trying to get Indians to part
with pieces of ritual paraphernalia. What emerged from the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> winter collection was a perception of the village Indians as warriors and farmers. It would take nineteenth-century artists like George Catlin and Karl Bodmer and explorers like Prince Maximilian to broaden that narrow image.</p>
               <p>Much of the winter of 1804-1805 was a shared experience with Indian neighbors. With so many friendly villages close at hand, it was natural that both explorers and natives should participate in all sorts of activities. From formal rituals and largescale hunts to more intimate encounters, the expedition's members learned about Indians by living parts of villager culture. Because the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> did not schedule major rituals like the creation drama called the Okipa during the winter, the explorers did not witness those powerful ceremonies. However, the
Americans did participate in the buffalo-calling rites during January 1805 and saw a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> war medicine dance the same month.</p>
               <p>Excluded by the calendar from the important public rituals, the explorers did gain much information about Indian life by taking part in less spectacular but perhaps more typical events. On a hunting trip with <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> observed the plains custom of marking ownership of downed animals. As he related it to <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, buffalo carcasses without identifying arrows in them could be claimed by anyone needing meat. <a href="#n0527" id="ln0527" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a> From eating in earth lodges the explorers learned about village menus and food preparation. Participation in some aspects of Indian daily life did not mean that the Americans changed their own cultural identity. But sharing some
of the joys, troubles, and labor of a Dakota winter did give the expedition's ethnographers a sense of authority when they wrote about Indian life.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did not gather information out of idle curiosity. Although never attempting any complete picture of village life, they gave purpose and method to their ethnographic enterprise. That methodology can be best seen in their "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." More than random entries in their journals, the "Estimate" was the showpiece of their ethnography. Drafted by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> during the winter, the document was a massive effort to organize and compare data on nearly fifty tribes and bands. In concept and design it was as scientific as expedition ethnography ever got. Organized in tabular form and structured around nineteen questions, the "Estimate" recorded such things as tribal names, location, population, languages, and potential for American trade. Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> composed an "Estimate of the Western Indians" during the winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, that later document was not nearly as intricate or comprehensive.</p>

               <p>The "Estimate" and its questions sprang in part from the explorers' own efforts to pare down the lists of complex questions proposed by <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> and <span class="tei_name">Rush</span>. But the document was more than an expedient response to dwindling time and short abilities. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment stressed the careful gathering and thoughtful comparison of all knowledge. Learning needed to be practical, as the American Philosophical Society recognized when it dedicated itself to "Promoting Useful Knowledge." And in that age of encyclopedias, information required organization in order to be useful. The chapter organization and comparative charts in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span>
                  <em class="hi">Notes on the State of <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span>
                  </em> may have been the progenitor of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> "Estimate."</p>
               <p>Typical of the informants <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> sought out for the "Estimate" were two Indians, <span class="tei_name">Greasy Head</span> and an unnamed <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span>, who came to <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> early in March 1805 and "gave some account of the Indians near the <span class="tei_name">rockey Mountains</span>." <span class="tei_name">Hugh Heney</span> provided "the names and charecktors of the <span class="tei_name">Seeaux</span>" and the <span class="tei_name">Chippewas</span>. From <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> contacts came information on the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span>, and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   Indians. Reaching back to their days near <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>, the explorers used traders' information on the three 
                     <span class="tei_name">Pawnee</span>
                   divisions as well
as the <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span> and <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> peoples. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> careful list of Indians who traded with the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages proved invaluable when filling out the sections dealing with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Arapaho</span>
                  , Sutaio, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Kiowa Apache</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Comanche</span>, and other central plains and southwest Indians. <a href="#n0529" id="ln0529" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>All that questioning, analyzing, and comparing produced accurate data about the names, numbers, and locations of Indians from the western <span class="tei_name">Great Lakes</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span>, and from the Canadian plains to north <span class="tei_name">Texas</span>. What <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wanted, at least during the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , was a kind of statistical geography of those tribes they had already met, those yet to be encountered, and those who might influence United States Indian policy. And that is really what the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" proved to be—a limited but practical document
for government agents and fur traders.</p>
               <p>Although the "Estimate" was the key document produced by the expedition's ethnographers during the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> season, other records from that period contained information about the Indians. <span class="tei_name">Thomas Jefferson</span>, who had long been interested in Indian languages, provided the captains with blank vocabulary sheets as a means to collect and preserve native words and phrases. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> told <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> that great care was exercised in getting each sound properly recorded. Writing years after the expedition <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> declared that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> "never miss[ed] an opportunity of taking a vocabulary." The trader <span class="tei_name">Charles Mackenzie</span> verified the explorers' commitment to language study, noting their struggles to capture words translated through several speakers. Knowing just how tense relations were between the American party and the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>-proper makes the expedition's successful effort to obtain a vocabulary from one of <span class="tei_name">Le Borgne's</span> brothers a genuine accomplishment. All told, the captains gathered some fourteen word lists to be sent downriver at the end of the winter. One of the lasting tragedies was that all that work was lost or misplaced after the expedition returned. <a href="#n0530" id="ln0530" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Although those lost lists cannot be studied for their linguistic content, it is important to recognize the sorts of words and phrases sought out by the expedition. Reflecting <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> commitment to useful knowledge, the blank vocabularies reveal a set of some 315 words needed for simple conversations between Indians and traders or government officials. The explorers were to gather classes of words ranging from Indian equivalents for simple numbers to the names of common animals. Names of the seasons, kinds of trees and plants, labels for family relationships, and words for basic human emotions were all to be included in the collecting process. Neither so utilitarian as the simple trading phrase vocabularies written by Hudson's Bay Company employees nor so complex as the dictionaries compiled later in the century by linguists working for the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> vocabularies represent an attempt to gather information useful to men of science, government, and business. <a href="#n0531" id="ln0531" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Most of the ethnographic data collected by the expedition was recorded in journal entries, the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians," and the now-lost vocabularies. But there were two additional sources of Indian information, which bring to light important aspects of native life as well as the fundamental contribution made by Indians to the expedition. Throughout the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> carefully gathered material in order to draw a large map of western America he called a "Connection of the Countrey." Writing in his journal on January 7, 1805, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
reported that he was busy drafting "a connected plott from the information of Traders, Indians &amp; my own observation &amp; ideas." One historical geographer has called <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> map "the foremost" result of the period of information gathering and analysis, while a specialist in historical cartography has described it as "one of
the most significant maps produced by the expedition." <a href="#n0532" id="ln0532" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Usually noted as an example of the way <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> pictured the West before leaving <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, the map also contained important tribal locations and population estimates. How <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> obtained such Indian ethnographic and geographic information and how he fitted that data into his own mental framework amount to a unique cultural confrontation. His cartography also suggests the Indians' views of their own physical environment as well as their ways of conveying those views to strangers. Just how much information about the proposed route from <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> to the mountains came from Indian sources can be judged by another document—<span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> "Summary View of the Rivers and Creeks which discharge themselves into the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>." Composed during the winter of 1804-1805, this detailed study of rivers and streams between <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span> is often cited as further evidence of the expedition's skill at gathering and analyzing a mass of geographic data. At the same time, a careful reading of the document reveals both the amount and quality of geographic knowledge available from the Indians around <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>.</p>
               <p>Histories of North American exploration have often slighted the role of the Indians as suppliers of essential information to white explorers. Undue attention to the supposed efforts of <span class="tei_name">Sacagawea</span> to "guide" <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> has tended to obscure the vital contributions of <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> mapmakers to the American enterprise. During the months of December and January, as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was hard at work on his western map, three important Indian-mapping sources became available to him. On December 17, he got from <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> "some sketches which he had obtained from the Indians to the West of this place." Just who those western Indians were or what information was contained in those sketches is not clear from the surviving evidence. However, <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> was highly regarded by the captains and any data he had
from Indian sources was bound to get serious consideration. Early in January, as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> continued work on his map, the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> visited the fort and provided more valuable information. <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "a Scetch of the Countrey as far as the high Mountains, &amp; on the south Side of the River Rejone [<span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span>]." The chief explained that six small rivers emptied into the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> on the south, that the land was hilly and heavily timbered, and that there were "Great numbers of beaver." Guided by <span class="tei_name">Sheheke's</span> words or perhaps his drawing, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
drafted a map of the <span class="tei_name">Yellowstone</span> from its confluence with the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> to its assumed headwaters somewhere in the <span class="tei_name">Rockies</span>. <a href="#n0533" id="ln0533" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>The "sketches" provided by <span class="tei_name">Heney</span> and <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span> may not have been visual representations but rather verbal descriptions of lands and rivers toward the mountains. On January 16 the expedition did receive an unmistakably Indian map from a visiting <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> chief. "This war chief," wrote <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, "gave us a Chart in his way of the <span class="tei_name">Missourie</span>." Because <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> raiders had personal knowledge of lands and peoples up to and sometimes beyond the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> always placed high value on their reports. But <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> phrase "a Chart in his way" hints at both the means the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> cartographer chose to construct his map and the problems the American explorer had in interpreting it.</p>
               <p>As <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> explained later to <span class="tei_name">Biddle</span>, Indian maps came in several shapes and forms. Some were flat drawings made on skins or mats while others were three-dimensional relief maps made in sand, "hills designated by raising sand, rivers by hollow etc." Although it is not certain which method had been employed in making this <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> map, there was no doubt that working with it posed serious problems. Accustomed to dealing with flat maps having North at the top, locations plotted by latitude and longitude, and distances measured in miles, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> must have found the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> map bewildering. Both Indians and whites made maps, but the interests of those peoples and their cartographic conventions were quite different. Indian mapmakers often oriented their maps along sunrise and sunset lines or toward the direction of travel. Distances were measured in terms of travel time while directions were expressed in words such as above and below. Because Indians mapped what was important to them, the concerns of the expedition must have sometimes appeared strange or illogical. Used to travel overland by horse, plains people found it difficult to answer questions about the heads of navigation on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and other rivers. Lines drawn in the sand might mean creeks, game trails, or often-used war routes. Language itself compounded the problem. Simple prepositions such as <em class="hi">to</em> and <em class="hi">from</em> could be crucial in explaining the direction of a river's flow. The shape of the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> map, its unfamiliar conventions, and the cultural assumptions behind it must have challenged <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> abilities. That the explorer and the Indian were willing to attempt such communication across an especially treacherous cultural divide testifies to the skill and persistence of both men. <a href="#n0534" id="ln0534" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>It was easier for <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to fix tribes and villages on his own western map than to interpret native charts. In many ways <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> 1805 map was a visual statement of the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." The peoples classified and tabulated in the "Estimate" were located spatially on <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> map. From his vantage point at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages, the explorer looked north and properly located the several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Cree</span> bands in what is now <span class="tei_name">Manitoba</span> and <span class="tei_name">Saskatchewan</span>. Farther to the North and West, in northern <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> and <span class="tei_name">Saskatchewan</span>, he correctly placed
two of the <span class="tei_name">Blackfeet</span> divisions, the <span class="tei_name">Bloods</span> and the Siksikas. On the <span class="tei_name">North Saskatchewan River</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> precisely spotted the Sarsi Indians. Turning west, he accurately recorded the locations and populations of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crow</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Comanche</span>, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Cheyenne</span>
                  , <span class="tei_name">Kiowa</span>, 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                  , and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   Indians. Drawing on information from <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> sources, he noted the important links between the <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span> and the River 
                     <span class="tei_name">Crows</span>
                  . Recognizing the distant travels of <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> warriors, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took pains to trace "the war path of the <span class="tei_name">Big Bellies</span>" from the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span> villages, along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, across the mountains, and on to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flathead</span>
                   Indians in the present-day <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Valley</span> in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>. <a href="#n0535" id="ln0535" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>While <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was occupied in recording Indian information on his map, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was gathering equally significant native data to incorporate in his compilation of <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> waterways and prominent geographical features. For his description of the creeks and rivers flowing into the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> between <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> could rely on the expedition's firsthand experience. But for details beyond the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Knife River</span>, the explorer admitted that "the subsequent description of this river [the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>], and its subsidiary streams are taken altogether from Indian information." Convinced that such information was "entitled to some confidence," <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> nonetheless was careful to explain that he and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had closely questioned natives during the entire winter, compared their answers, and accepted only those that could be cross-checked. What came from mostly <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> sources was a remarkably accurate picture of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> from the <span class="tei_name">Great Bend</span> to its headwaters. But just as the Indians' different cultural perceptions made mapping from their data difficult, so did those same problems distort <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> analysis. Nowhere was that distortion more evident than in the ways explorers and Indians understood the nature of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span>
                  
                  <span class="tei_name">of the Missouri</span>. The Indians' description was especially vivid, telling of the power and thunderous sound of the
falls. But because <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> warriors had no experience carrying heavy boats and cumbersome luggage around the falls, they reported that the portage was "not greater than half a mile." As it turned out, the expedition struggled over a bruising eighteen-mile route around the falls. Despite misunderstandings about the identity of the <span class="tei_name">Marias River</span>, the nature of the <span class="tei_name">Great Falls</span> portage, a purported easy passage over the <span class="tei_name">Continental Divide</span>, and the imagined south fork of the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>
                  
                  <span class="tei_name">River</span> just
over the divide, the Indians' information proved not only accurate but invaluable. <a href="#n0536" id="ln0536" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>To evaluate <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ethnographic contributions, three related questions ought to be posed. First, what did the explorers see, understand, and accurately record? Determined to study the externals of Indian culture, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> excelled at describing village locations, weapons, food, clothing and other material aspects. Journal accounts of village meals illustrate the point. With obvious relish, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> described <span class="tei_name">Little Crow's</span> wife stirring "a kettle of boiled Cimnins, beans, corn and choke cherries with the stones." <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> went further, describing with cookbook accuracy the ingredients and shaping of Indian corn ball bread. The sergeant found that this part of the Indian diet "eats verry well." <a href="#n0537" id="ln0537" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a> With a common-sense curiosity that characterized so much of the expedition's ethnography, the explorers observed and tasted the stuff of Indian life.</p>
               <p>On occasion, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were able to understand and record other aspects of Indian life, including trade, a subject of intense interest to them. Although sometimes confused by Indian notions of what was valuable in an economic exchange, the explorers did comprehend one of the central rituals in intertribal trade. Because Indians who traded at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> villages were for most of the year potential enemies, or relatives of those killed in combat, means had to be found to forestall possible violence and allow peaceful relations. Reflecting the fundamental Indian social reality that defined relatives as friends and outsiders as enemies, villagers and nomads created a ceremony in which strangers were made temporary, fictional relatives. Men who might later fight each other could for a brief time exchange goods, trade stories, and even share religious practices as fathers and sons. <a href="#n0538" id="ln0538" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Sieur de la Vérendrye was the first European to record this practice of adoption, reporting that the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   Indians who accompanied him asked to be adopted as his "children," thus repeating the formula they had long employed with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  . In mid-November 1804, with a large number of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Assiniboin</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Cree Indians</span> camped nearby, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took note of "a serimony of adoption, and interchange of property." Relating the process to <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> explained that "every man of the North makes a <em class="hi">comrade</em> of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> or <span class="tei_name">Ricara</span> with whom he had to deal." An exchange of gifts sealed the adoption, established certain bargaining limits, and signaled the opening of peaceful trade. <a href="#n0539" id="ln0539" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a second question equally worth asking. What did the expedition see, record, but not understand? During that long <span class="tei_name">Dakota</span> winter the explorers encountered many things well beyond their own cultural experience. Ritual behavior or social customs often eluded their grasp, especially if they had no counterparts in white American life. Berdaches, those plains Indian men who dressed and acted as women, caught the captains' attention but evaded their understanding. First mentioned by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> in late December 1804, the berdaches were described as "men
dressed in squars clothes." In conversation with <span class="tei_name">Biddle</span>, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> amplified that original description, adding that young <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> boys showing "any symptoms of effeminacy or girlish inclinations" were raised as women, married men, and fulfilled all the functions assigned to <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> women. But <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had missed the spiritual nature of the berdache while imposing an interpretation of sexual deviation where none belonged. What he perceived as gender confusion or homosexuality was actually something quite outside his own experience. Men became berdaches not early in life but usually as teenagers or later. The berdache role could be assumed only after a series of dreams from the Holy Woman Above. Only brothers or sons of men owning ceremonial rights to the Woman Above and Holy Woman bundles could
become berdaches. After having the required dreams and assuming women's clothing, berdaches were viewed as persons of great and sometimes mysterious spirit power. <a href="#n0540" id="ln0540" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>The explorers were equally confused by the few native religious rituals they witnessed. One of those was the practice of feeding to buffalo heads or skulls a ceremonial meal. When <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> saw a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> offer food to a buffalo head, he ridiculed the devotion, saying, "Their superstitious credulity is so great, that they will believe
by using the head well the living buffalo will come and that they will get a supply of meat." After the expedition's hunters killed a buffalo and put its head on the bow of the keelboat, an Indian passing by stopped and spent some time smoking to the buffalo. Asked what he was doing, the man replied that the buffalo was his medicine and required this ritual. <a href="#n0541" id="ln0541" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Although the ceremony was accurately described by <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, its meaning escaped them. The Americans did not sense the connection Indians made between living things and those apparently dead. Feeding buffalo heads could appease the spirits of dead animals while reassuring those that were to be hunted and killed. Hunters always made a small offering to a skull before beginning the hunt. Buffalo skulls were often included in the most powerful of the medicine bundles. Unaware of the sanction given to buffalo feeding by the buffalo culture hero in the Sacred Arrows myth, the explorers could interpret the practice as only savage superstition or childish fantasy. <a href="#n0542" id="ln0542" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>One of the rituals of village life most carefully recorded and least understood was the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> buffalo-calling ceremony. The open sexuality of the rite certainly attracted some of the American party, but the purpose of that ritual intercourse simply baffled <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. Several men in the expedition obligingly took part in it, and their experiences enabled <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to write a remarkably detailed description of buffalo calling. He realized that the ceremony was undertaken to attract the herd and guarantee a successful hunt. But he simply could not fathom how sexual relations between old men or white men and the wives of younger Indians could bring the animals closer and ensure good kills. Admiring much about the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> way, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found it difficult to reconcile what seemed random promiscuity with his own positive evaluation of village life. He did not understand that northern plains cultures assumed that sexual intercourse was like a pipeline that could transfer spiritual power from one person to another. Old men had that special power and, as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> himself noted, "the Indians say all white flesh is medisan." Giving their wives to old men or white strangers was a way aspiring young men could appropriate powerful spirit forces for themselves. Nothing in his cultural heritage prepared <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to comprehend all this, but he had the good sense to make an accurate record of the event. It is important to recall that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> was not prudish about buffalo calling. He
wrote his account in plain English. It was only later that the proper Philadelphian <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> put <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> forthright words into genteel Latin. <a href="#n0543" id="ln0543" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ethnography needs to be assessed by what the explorers did not see. Since it was the wrong season of the year, they did not witness the awesome Okipa. Because many essential social aspects of native life were culturally invisible to most white outsiders, the captains did not take note of the clans and age-grade societies that gave shape to Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Indian life. Some objects were hidden from all strangers: <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> neither saw nor wrote about the sacred bundles, the turtle drums, and the ceremonies that surrounded those objects. Just how much Indian religious practice the explorers understood is not clear from the evidence. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> did write about "medicine" and tried to explain the idea to <span class="tei_name">Biddle</span> by recounting part of a <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> creation story. <a href="#n0544" id="ln0544" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a> But it is doubtful if any member of the expedition understood the plains belief in power or medicine as a tangible force that pervaded all life. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never saw the interior of the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> universe. That universe—the amalgam of behavior and values that made villagers who they were—was simply beyond the explorers' cultural horizon.</p>
               <p>During the winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> served their apprenticeships in ethnography. They saw much and recorded most of it in simple, commonsense language. Migration stories, selective prairie burning, and warriors' weapons—all were described in the expedition's record. By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> got to the

                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , they were journeymen ethnographers on the way to becoming masters.</p>
