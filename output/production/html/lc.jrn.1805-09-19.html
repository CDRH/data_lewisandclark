Set out this morning a little after sun rise and continued our rout about the same course of yesterday or S. 20 W. for 6 miles when the ridge terminated and we to our inexpressable joy discovered a large tract of Prairie country lying to the S. W. and widening as it appeared to extend to the W. <a href="#n22091901" id="ln22091901" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> through that plain the Indian informed us that the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia river</a>, in which we were in surch run.    this plain appeared to be about 60 Miles distant, but our guide assured us that we should reach it's borders tomorrow    the appearance of this country, our only hope for subsistance greately revived the sperits of the party already reduced and much weakened for the want of food.    the country is thickly covered with a very heavy growth of pine of which I have ennumerated 8 distinct species. after leaving the ridge we asscended and decended several steep mountains in the distance of 6 miles further when we struck a Creek about 15 yards wide. <a href="#n22091902" id="ln22091902" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    our course being S. 35 W. we continued our rout 6 miles along the side of this creek upwards passing 2 of it's branches which flowed in from the N. 1st at the place we struck the creek and the other 3 miles further. <a href="#n22091903" id="ln22091903" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    the road was excessively dangerous along this creek being a narow rockey path generally on the side of steep precipice, from which in many places if ether man or horse were precipitated they would inevitably be dashed in pieces. <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Fraziers</a> horse fell from this road in the evening, and roled with his load near a hundred yards into the Creek. we all expected that the horse was killed but to our astonishment when the load was taken off him he arose to his feet &amp; appeared to be but little injured, in 20 minutes he proceeded with his load.    this was the most wonderfull escape I ever witnessed, the hill down which he roled was almost perpendicular and broken by large irregular and broken rocks. the course of this Creek upwards due W.    we encamped on the Stard. side of it in a little raviene, <a href="#n22091904" id="ln22091904" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> having traveled 18 miles over a very bad road. we took a small quantity of portable soup, and retired to rest much fatiegued.    several of the men are unwell of the disentary.    brakings out, or irruptions of the Skin, have also been common with us for some time.

                  <span class="italic">Thursday 19th.</span>    Our hunters did not join us last night, which was disagreeably cold. About 8 this morning we set out, and proceeded on in our way over the mountains; the sun shining warm and pleasant. We travelled a 
west course, and about 12 o'clock halted at a spring to take a little more soup. The snow is chiefly gone except on the north points of the high mountains. At 2 P. M. we again went on, and descended a steep mountain into a cove on our left hand, where there is a large creek, <a href="#n22091916" id="ln22091916" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a> which here runs towards the east. The hills on each side, along which the trail or path passes, are very steep. One of our horses fell down the precipice about 100 feet, and was not killed, nor much hurt: the reason was, that there is no bottom below, and the precipice, the only bank, which the creek has; therefore the horse pitched into the water, without meeting with any intervening object, which could materially injure him. We made 17 miles this day and encamped on a small branch of the creek. Having heard nothing from our hunters, we again supped upon some of our portable soup. The men are becoming lean and debilitated, on account of the scarcity and poor quality of the provisions 
on which we subsist: our horses' feet are also becoming very sore. We have, however, some hopes of getting soon out of this horrible mountainous desert, as we have discovered the appearance of a valley or level part of the country about 40 miles ahead. When this discovery was made there was as much joy and rejoicing among the corps, as happens among passengers at 
sea, who have experienced a dangerous and protracted voyage, when they first discover land on the long looked for coast.

Thursday Septemr 19th    A clear pleasant morning, we set out early, &amp; ascended the top of the Mountain on the side of which we lay last night, We discovered from the Top of this mountain; a plain which lay in a Valley, which we suppose to lay about 20 Miles from us, We expect this plain is where the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> is, this revived the drooping spirits of our party.    We descended down this Mountain, which we found dangerous for about 3 Miles, We then ascended another Mountain; which was as bad to ascend as any Mountain we had yet seen, this was very fataigueing to ourselves &amp; horses, 
the ground was covered with Snow &amp; froze, The Pine &amp; Spruce, balsam Fir timber on the Top of these Mountains, &amp; in some places thick bushes.—    We descended this Mountain &amp; came down into a narrow Valley, where we 
found a run of water.    We halted at that place to rest our horses &amp; to eat some portable soup.    One of our Men here killed a Pheasant, There was no kind of Game to be seen in these Mountains, &amp; scarcely any Birds.    We delayed about 2 hours—    &amp; proceeded on, &amp; descended a mountain about four Miles, and arrived at a Creek, whose course run east, we pursued our way up the Creek on a bad piece of Road, some places running along close 
under the Mountain; which is high &amp; steep on both sides of the Creek, One of our horses fell backwards, &amp; rolled about 100 feet down a steep solid Rock, and dashed against a Rock, in the Creek with his load; which was Ammunition; The Powder, being in leaden Cannisters, was not damaged, nor the horse killed, but much hurt.—    We proceeded on, and encamped at a run of Water in the said Mountain; In the evening, our party had a little portable Soup made to subsist on.    They all are very weak &amp; feeble &amp; suffer much for want of Provisions, Our horses feet are very much worn, &amp; they have fallen away very much, since we came into the Mountains.</p>
               <p>
The Men still seem contented; &amp; flatter themselves of soon getting out of the Mountains.    Our course during this day, has been chiefly a West course &amp; we came about 17 Miles—
