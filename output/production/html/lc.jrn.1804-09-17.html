Having for many days past confined myself to the boat, I determined to devote this day to amuse myself on shore with my gun and view the interior of the country lying between the river and the <a class="regularization" title="American (Corvus) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=American%20%28Corvus%29%20Creek">Corvus Creek</a>—    accordingly before sunrise I set out with six of my best hunters, <a href="#n06091701" id="ln06091701" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> two of whom I dispatched to the lower side of <a class="regularization" title="American (Corvus) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=American%20%28Corvus%29%20Creek">Corvus creek</a>, two with orders to hunt the bottoms and woodland on the river, while I retained two others to acompany me in the intermediate country.    one quarter of a mile in rear of our camp which was situated in a fine open grove of cotton wood passed a grove of plumb trees loaded with fruit and now ripe.    observed but little difference between this fruit and that of a similar kind common to the Atlantic States. <a href="#n06091702" id="ln06091702" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>    the trees are smaller and more thickly set.    this forrest of plumb trees garnish a plain about 20 feet more lelivated than that on which we were encamped; this plain extends back about a mile to the foot of the hills one mile distant and to which it is gradually ascending    this plane extends with the same bredth from the creek below to the distance of near three miles above parrallel with the river, and is intirely occupyed by the burrows of the <em class="hi">barking squril</em> hertefore discribed; this anamal appears here in infinite numbers, and the shortness and virdue [verdure] of grass gave the plain the appearance throughout it's whole extent of beatifull bowlinggreen in fine order.    it's aspect is S. E.    a great number of wolves of the small kind, halks and some pole-cats <a href="#n06091703" id="ln06091703" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> were to be seen. I presume that those anamals feed on this squirril.—    found the country in every direction for about three miles intersected with deep revenes and steep irregular hills of 100 to 200 feet high; at the tops of these hills the country breakes of as usual into a fine leavel plain extending as far as the eye can reach.    from this plane I had an extensive view of the river below, and the irregular hills which border the opposite sides of the river and creek.    the surrounding country had been birnt about a month before and young grass had now sprung up to hight of 4 Inches presenting the live green of the spring.    to the West a high range of hills, <a href="#n06091704" id="ln06091704" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> strech across the country from N. to S and appeared distant about 20 Miles; they are not very extensive as I could plainly observe their rise and termination    no rock appeared on them and the sides were covered with virdue similar to that of the plains    this senery already rich pleasing and beatiful, was still farther hightened by immence herds of Buffaloe deer Elk and Antelopes which we saw in every direction feeding on the hills and plains. I do not think I exagerate when I estimate the number of Buffaloe which could be compreed at one view to amount to 3000.    my object was if possible to kill a female Antelope having already procured a male; I pursued my rout on this plain to the west flanked by my two hunters untill eight in the morning when I made the signal for them to come to me which they did shortly after.    we rested our selves about half an hour, and regailed ourselves on half a bisquit each and some jirk of Elk which we had taken the precaution to put in our pouches in the morning before we set out, and drank of the water of a small pool which had collected on this plain from the rains which had fallen some days before. We had now after various windings in pursuit of several herds of antelopes which we had seen on our way made the distance of about eight miles from our camp.    we found the Antelope extreemly shye and watchfull insomuch that we had been unable to get a shot at them; when at rest they generally seelect the most elivated point in the neighbourhood, and as they are watchfull and extreemly quick of sight and their sense of smelling very accute it is almost impossible to approach them within gunshot; in short they will frequently discover and flee from you at the distance of three miles. I had this day an opportunity of witnessing the agility and superior fleetness of this anamal which was to me really astonishing. I had pursued and twice surprised a small herd of seven, in the first instance they did not discover me distinctly and therefore did not run at full speed, tho' they took care before they rested to gain an elivated point where it was impossible to approach them under cover except in one direction and that happened to be in the direction from which the wind blew towards them; bad as the chance to approach them was, I made the best of my way towards them, frequently peeping over the ridge with which I took care to conceal myself from
their view    the male, of which there was but one, frequently incircled the summit of the hill on which the females stood in a group, as if to look out for the approach of danger. I got within about 200 paces of them when they smelt me and fled; I gained the top of the eminece on which they stood, as soon as possible from whence I had an extensive view of the country    the antilopes which had disappeared in a steep revesne now appeared at the distance of about three miles on the side of a ridge which passed obliquely across me and extended about four miles.    so soon had these antelopes gained the distance at which they had again appeared to my view I doubted at ferst that they were the same that I had just surprised, but my doubts soon vanished when I beheld the rapidity of their flight along the ridge before me    it appeared reather the rappid flight of birds than the motion of quadrupeds. I think I can safely venture the asscertion that the speed of this anamal is equal if not superior to that of the finest blooded courser.—    this morning I saw <a href="#n06091705" id="ln06091705" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
