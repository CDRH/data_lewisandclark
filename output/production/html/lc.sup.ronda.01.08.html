               <p>
As the Corps of Discovery settled into winter quarters along the <span class="tei_name">Netul (Lewis and Clark) River</span>, <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> described the site of <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> as "the most eligable Situation for our purposes of any in its neighbourhood." <a href="#n0801" id="ln0801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> But neither <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> nor his fellow explorers seemed quite able to fix those purposes clearly in mind. It was as if once reaching the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> the expedition lost a sense of direction and purpose. The reasons for raising <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> seemed less compelling than those that had brought <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> to life. On the coast the expedition needed time to prepare itself for a demanding return across the continent. The store of notes and maps from the outbound journey had to be consolidated. In the spruce and fir forests and marshlands around the fort, plants and animals new to eastern eyes required observation, description, and cataloging. To continue their ethnography, the explorers would have to question Indians and court their chiefs. And, as always, they looked at the land and its peoples with the needs of an expanding American trade empire in mind. From natural history and economic geography to salt boiling and moccasin making—these seemed to qualify as "our purposes." But none of these could spark the excitement and anticipation that had run through life a winter before at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. In the predictable procession of wind, storm, and fog, the months ahead loomed as an endless round of rain-soaked days. A season at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> seemed to promise mildew, spoiled meat, and numbing boredom.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> "eligable Situation" would have pleased any <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> band seeking a winter village site. They might have quickly appreciated the advantages provided by the river and surrounding forests and wetlands. But what any native of the lower <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> knew to be a bountiful country was soon perceived by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as a damp prison stocked with meager fare. That there could be two such divergent ways of evaluating the Pacific Northwest is fundamental in understanding expedition-Indian relatins during the winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. Americans and <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> saw themselves, each other, and the physical environment in profoundly different ways.</p>
               <p>
Symbolic of those differences was the expedition's obvious disgust with coastal weather. A powerful entry in <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> journal for December 16, 1805, captured a sense of awe and fear. "The rain continues, with Tremendious gusts of wind, which is Tremendious. The winds violent    Trees falling in every direction, whorl winds, with gusts of rain    Hail &amp; Thunder, This kind of weather lasted all day, Certainly one of the worst days that ever was!" Less memorable but perhaps more typical were the string of phrases "we are all wet and disagreeable," "cold and a dreadful day," and most common of all, "the rain continued as usual" <a href="#n0802" id="ln0802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> While explorers huddled in their dank quarters and cursed the foul weather, the Indians went about their daily routine knowing that wind, rain, and thunder were but spirit forces making their powers known for all to see. Paddling canoes that defied the worst waves and wearing hats and capes admirably suited to wet days, the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> may have paused to wonder why the bearded men in the log lodge feared the weather and hid from it.</p>
               <p>
Those Indians perplexed by the strange behavior of their neighbors on the <span class="tei_name">Netul</span> had not lacked contact with other whites or their fascinating metals and textiles. A decade before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wintered at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, Europeans had come to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> with stocks of tea kettles, copper sheets, and blue beads. By 1805 the annual spring visits of British and American ships to a rendezvous on the waters of <span class="tei_name">Bakers Bay</span> had become an eagerly anticipated event in the lower <span class="tei_name">Chinookans'</span> year. European-manufactured objects quickly pervaded native life. Guns, brass bracelets, and iron pots took an honored place among the goods in burial vaults up the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and along the coast. As if to emphasize that outside contact, the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> trade jargon was amply filled with salty English words and phrases.</p>
               <p>
The contacts lower <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> had with whites before <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> determined a substantial part of their reaction to the expedition. Those experiences had their recorded beginnings in 1792 when three distinct parties crossed the treacherous bar of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and entered the world of the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> and their neighbors. In May of that year, <span class="tei_name">Captain Robert Gray</span> and his ship <em class="hi">Columbia Rediviva</em> sailed upriver on a merchant excursion that lasted until the end of the month. <span class="tei_name">Gray</span>, who had already made a journey to the coast, was intent on capturing some of the sea otter trade that had drawn so many ships farther north. The American captain found the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> anxious to exchange skins for a wide variety of hardware and cloth. In the fall of the same year, the river had its second caller. The Royal Navy ship <em class="hi">Chatham,</em> under the command of <span class="tei_name">Lt. W. R. Broughton</span> and part of the <span class="tei_name">Vancouver</span> expedition, explored far up the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. <span class="tei_name">Broughton's</span> purpose was not overtly commercial, but he did note the interest of river people in manufactured goods, an observation not lost on English maritime investors. The last visitor in that busy year was the British trader <span class="tei_name">Captain James Baker</span> in the ship <em class="hi">Jenny.</em>
                  <span class="tei_name">Baker</span> pursued a brisk trade with the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> at the bay named for him. The ships on the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> in 1792 were just the beginning of a whole fleet yet to come. <a href="#n0803" id="ln0803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By the mid-1790s, traders were making the lower reaches of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> a regular stop on the sea otter network that now stretched from <span class="tei_name">Boston</span> and Bristol to <span class="tei_name">Nootka Sound</span> and on to <span class="tei_name">China</span>. Captains like those the Indians later listed for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were attracted not only by sea otters and beavers but by arrowproof moosehide armor called clamons. These "leather war dresses" were then exchanged for pelts with the warriors of what is now <span class="tei_name">British Columbia</span>. Typical of those trading ventures and the relations between merchants and Indians was the voyage of the Bristol ship <em class="hi">Ruby</em> and her captain <span class="tei_name">Charles Bishop</span>. Late in May 1795, the <em class="hi">Ruby</em> braved the vicious currents of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> bar to anchor at <span class="tei_name">Bakers Bay</span>. Already familiar with the trading routine, scores of <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> paddled out to the ship and asked <span class="tei_name">Bishop</span> to fire a gun announcing the start of business. If <span class="tei_name">Bishop</span> believed that his fine store of merchandise would tempt <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> to hand over quickly valuable skins and clamons, he was quite mistaken. The Indians had already learned about supply and demand. They had become, in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> colorful phrase, "great higlers in trade." <a href="#n0804" id="ln0804" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Even if <span class="tei_name">Bishop's</span> array of kettles, brass rods, and brightly colored cloth tempted them, the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> knew the value of tantalizing delay. "In the Evening," recalled the British skipper, "the whole of them took to their cannoes and paddled to shore, leaving us not more disappointed than surprized." Thinking they had made their point, the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> returned the next day and began to set prices. But <span class="tei_name">Bishop</span> was equally willing to play the waiting game, and it was not until the following day that he "broke trade with the Natives." By June 5 the <em class="hi">Ruby</em> had on board more than one hundred sea otter pelts of fine quality. If the captain ws pleased, so were the Indians. The rituals of trade had been properly observed and both peoples had increased personal wealth, a cherished goal that united traders on both sides of the cultural divide. <a href="#n0805" id="ln0805" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Out of the sorts of encounters with ships like the <em class="hi">Ruby,</em> the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> developed a set of expectations about Europeans. The whites were a trading people who came from the sea in large canoes to exchange valuable metal and cloth for skins. Traders could be violent, but their touchy tempers might be softened by having women do much of the bargaining for both goods and services. The <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> were convinced, at least by 1805, that whites would eventually pay any price for sea otter pelts. Trading became a ritual game enjoyed as much for sport as for material reward. But material rewards were never far from the center of all native coastal cultures, and when <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> refused to play the trading game there was some confusion and considerable misunderstanding. The whites were traders from the sea, hungry for skins and occasional sex. That a party of them might come overland bringing neither large supplies of goods nor a passion for pelts gave Indians pause to wonder what manner of <em class="hi">pâh-shish'-e-ooks</em> or "cloth men" these were.</p>
               <p>
Maritime traders like <span class="tei_name">Robert Gray</span> and <span class="tei_name">Charles Bishop</span> saw only a small segment of the Indian village world. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had been quite close to their Indian hosts. Such was not the case during the 1805–1806 winter. The decision to establish <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> two miles up the <span class="tei_name">Netul River</span> meant that the expedition was at some distance from any substantial Indian settlements. Situated northwest from the fort across the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> around <span class="tei_name">Bakers Bay</span> were several villages occupied by the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span>-proper. At the time of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, the most important <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> village was <span class="tei_name">Qwatsa'mts</span>, at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Chinook River</span> on <span class="tei_name">Bakers Bay</span>. This plank-house settlement was home to the powerful chief <span class="tei_name">Comcomly</span>. Although the explorers gave no village-by-village population figures for the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span>-proper, they did estimate the total number of houses at twenty-eight and the population at some four hundred.</p>
               <p>
Still on the north shore and northeast from <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> were the two villages of people <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called "<span class="tei_name">Wackiakums</span>." As was so often the case, the explorers had a difficult time separating the names of villages, bands, tribes, and linguistic divisions. The <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span> lived in two villages at the mouth of <span class="tei_name">Elochoman River</span>. The larger one, containing seven houses, was called <span class="tei_name">Wa'qaiya·qam</span>; the smaller, only four houses, was called <span class="tei_name">Lo'xumin</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span> were part of the Chinookan dialect division known as <span class="tei_name">Kathlamet</span>, but were not part of the political world of those <span class="tei_name">Cathlamet</span> villagers who lived on the south side of the great river—a fact that proved especially confusing for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>. <span class="tei_name">Kala amat or Cathlamet</span> was the native name for a town of nine large plank houses located on the south side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> about four miles below <span class="tei_name">Puget Island</span>. The <span class="tei_name">Cathlamets</span> remained at this site until about 1810, when they moved across the river and joined the <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span> at <span class="tei_name">Wa'qaiya·qam</span>.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> closest neighbors were the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop Indians</span>. The explorers knew and mapped three of their villages. Nearest to the fort was <span class="tei_name">Lä't'cap</span>, a name that meant "dried salmon" and provided Europeans with the name <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span>. The "dried salmon" village was about seven miles southwest from <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. Situated on a branch of the <span class="tei_name">Skipanon River</span> near the ocean, the village had three houses with twelve families. To this village <span class="tei_name">William Clark</span> traveled in December and met <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span>, a prominent headman. It may also have been home to the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> headman <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span>. North from "Dried Salmon" on <span class="tei_name">Point Adams</span> was the largest <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> settlement known to the expedition. <span class="tei_name">Neahkeluk</span> had eight large wooden houses; later in the nineteenth century, it would be palisaded for protection against hostile attack. For reasons that are now unclear, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never visited this village nor had any recorded contact with its leaders. Farther down the coastal plain at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Necanicum River</span> was a cluster of seven houses. Three of those were occupied by the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span>; the remainder of the <span class="tei_name">Tillamooks</span>. So at least fourteen houses in the area contained some two hundred <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span>.</p>
               <p>
The most distant of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> neighbors were the <span class="tei_name">Tillamooks</span>. Their villages along the coast began at the <span class="tei_name">Necanicum</span>, with most centered around <span class="tei_name">Tillamook Bay</span>. Because the <span class="tei_name">Tillamooks</span> spoke the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> jargon to strangers, the explorers did not realize that these Indians were not Chinookan speakers but belonged to the Salish language family. Early in the winter, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> believed that villages like <span class="tei_name">Necost</span>, <span class="tei_name">Natti</span>, and those around <span class="tei_name">Tillamook Bay</span> represented distinct nations. Only gradually did this confusion clear. It was to the village of <span class="tei_name">Necost</span>, at the mouth of <span class="tei_name">Elk Creek</span>, that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> traveled on his way to see a beached whale. In their "estimate of Western Indians," the explorers recorded that there were fifty <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> houses with a population totaling one thousand. <a href="#n0806" id="ln0806" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

In a disconcerting way, the winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> has no narrative history. The winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> had been a dramatic series of alarms and confusions punctuated by buffalo hunts, holiday celebrations, and occasional personal escapades. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> the major events were <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> trip to see a beached whale, <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal's</span> brush with death at the hands of a dangerous <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span>, and the ill-advised decision to steal a <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> canoe. None of these can compare with the dangers of threatened 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   attacks or the tensions of a diplomatic mission to a hostile <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> town. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, there were only the elemental tasks of hunting, cooking, and mending. Even these had a timeless quality about them as they were repeated day after day. It was more than dampness and slow rot that pervaded life on the coast. Boredom was rife, to be fought off by every means available. Journal entries took on an almost copybook quality, while busy fingers turned out more moccasins than would ever be needed for the return journey. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> captured that sense of time in suspension when he wrote, "Every thing moves on in the old way." <a href="#n0807" id="ln0807" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Because Indian relations at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> do not follow a chronological pattern, this chapter uses topical categories such as visiting, trading, diplomacy, and ethnography to suggest the ways explorers and Indians dealt with each other.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition was one of the greatest tourist attractions the native West had ever seen. Generally, crowds of Indians were attracted by the strangers and their fascinating array of weapons, clothing, and camp gear. Almost everywhere, visiting the explorers became a source of endless diversion and interesting conversation. Each visit had an element of personal discovery as both Indians and explorers eyed each other and then perhaps shared food or trade. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> there had been scarcely a day without a visit by Indians bent on seeing just what went on behind those log walls. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> encouraged visiting, knowing that it brought rewards in food, information, and security. During the winter with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , visiting was a two-way affair. Members of the expedition regularly paid calls at the earth-lodge villages. On New Year's Day, 1805, the explorers made especially festive trips to their Indian neighbors. Music, dancing, and hearty food marked that holiday fling. Although it would be too much to claim that the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers and the explorers made lasting friendships, the rituals of visiting in lodge and fort softened the rigors of a plains winter.</p>
               <p>
That kind of visiting, so characteristic of an earlier season, did not occur at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. For all sorts of reasons, the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> and the Americans did not share much of each other's company. When Indians came to the fort it was for business, not for companionship or curiosity. When <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> had been under construction, dozens of Indians had watched at every stage of the building. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> there were far fewer riverbank superintendents. Early in December, four Indians appeared at the fort site and spent the better part of the day staring at the explorers. Later in the month, as work moved slowly on the huts, two other Indians came to observe the project. Social visits were so unusual that when one did happen it was sure to be noted in the expedition's journals. One of those rare calls took place on January 20, when three <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> came to the fort and spent the day. As if to underscore how remarkable this was, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wrote, "The object of their visit is mearly to smoke the pipe." <a href="#n0808" id="ln0808" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
If only a handful of <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> bothered to pay friendly visits at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, there were even fewer white guests in plank houses. <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> journey to the "Dried Salmon" village on December 9 and 10 and his later trip to the <span class="tei_name">Tillamooks</span> were not so much social calls as reconnaissance probes for a good salt-boiling site or a supply of whale blubber. Members of the expedition did not visit their neighbors. Perhaps blocked by the strong currents in the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> estuary, no explorer ventured to the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> villages at <span class="tei_name">Bakers Bay</span>. Even more surprising, there is no record of anyone in the expedition visiting the largest <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> village, <span class="tei_name">Neahkeluk</span>, located on <span class="tei_name">Point Adams</span>. Not even the usual holiday spirit moved men like <span class="tei_name">Pierre Cruzatte</span> to take his fiddle outside <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop's</span> gates. New Year's Day, always a time in the French and English traditions to visit neighbors, did not see any noisy greetings shared with <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> villagers. The only members of the expedition who may have visited in Indian homes were those who, like <span class="tei_name">Joseph Field</span>, <span class="tei_name">William Bratton</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Geroge Gibson</span>, spent many days at the salt-boiling camp. At that site there were seven Indian houses, and it is possible that the men found them better shelter than their tents.</p>
               <p>
It was not from a lack of conviviality that Indians paid so few social calls at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first entered a <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> village he was treated with "extrodeanary friendship." His host, a man named <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span>, had new mats placed on the floor and presented the captain with platters of food. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> readily admitted that their neighbors could be "very loquacious and inquisitive." <a href="#n0809" id="ln0809" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> But the social distance between them could not be overcome. Part of the explanation rests with the increasing commercialization of coastal life. Trade and the acquisition of material wealth had always been an important part of <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> life. With the coming of white merchants and the influx of manufactured goods, that facet became even more prominant. Contacts with whites were commercial, not social. The Indians found nothing at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> that was especially strange or interesting. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> airgun might have drawn an extra look and <span class="tei_name">Drouillard's</span> marksmanship was impressive, but coastal people were already familiar with firearms, even if they did not own many. <span class="tei_name">York</span> was no attraction. Since American ships out of New England often brought black sailors, a man like York was not going to draw the kind of attention paid on the Upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. Few trade goods, language problems, and an isolated location served to make <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> a place remote from the centers of Indian activity.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps the central reason for the lack of sociability during the second winter rested with the expedition's Indian policy. As noted above, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> distrusted and disliked the peoples of the region. The explorers viewed them as habitual thives tainted with avarice and treachery. A long series of incidents and misunderstandings beginning with the expedition's descent of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> seemed to justify such suspicion and ill-concealed hostility. The explorers might well have asked how one could find friends among badly clad, ill-shaped people who squatted like frogs and tied the ankles of their young women. They did not want such Indians as part of the expedition's daily life.</p>
               <p>
The captains' desire to keep the Indians at bay was made plain in special orders written at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. Issued on January 1, 1806, they established strict procedures for dealing with Indians who came to the fort. Sentries were instructed to watch carefully for "the designs or approach of the savages." Once an Indian was seen coming toward the fort, sentries were required to inform the sergeant of the guard, who in turn was to notify either captain. The specific orders for the treatment of those Indians permitted inside the fort are important enough to be quoted in full.
<blockquote><p>
	The Commanding Officers require and charge the Garrison to
	treat the natives in a friendly manner; nor will they be
	permitted at any time, to abuse, assault or strike them;

One further section of the regulation calls for some attention. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, staying overnight had been an honor freely extended to many Indians. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, the sergeant of the guard, accompanied by <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> and two armed sentries, was required to "collect and put out of the fort, all Indians except such as may be permitted to remain by the Commanding Officers." <a href="#n0810" id="ln0810" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Only rarely was that permission granted and even visiting chiefs found themselves unceremoniously ejected from the compound at sunset. Such restrictions on hospitality were not lost on the Indians. Accustomed to considerable freedom in dealing with white traders, they could only resent the suspicion directed toward them from the fort on the <span class="tei_name">Netul</span>.</p>
               <p>
Although the restrictions on hospitality at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> and the natives' economic expectations of whites limited the number of social visits, there were nonetheless fairly regular meetings between the explorers and the Indians. Trading for objects made by native skill or gathered from the land or sea had always been a point of contact between Indians and Europeans. Even though both parties sometimes believed they were being shortchanged, the lure of furs and iron pots kept them coming back for more.</p>
               <p>
At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> the corn trade had been essential for the expedition's survival. Establishing the war-axe forge had been a measure of how far <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were willing to stretch their diplomacy to ensure a reliable food supply. But at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> there was a conscious effort to achieve self-sufficiency. The south side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> was chosen as a wintering site because it was reported to have a plentiful game supply. Led by <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard</span>, hunters in the expedition were expected to provide staples for the winter diet. But the scarcity of game, its often poor quality, and the difficulty in preserving meat in a warm, damp climate made self-sufficiency an impossible goal. It was plain that the expedition's larders would be bare or at least its diet monotonous unless an Indian food trade was established.</p>
               <p>
As their closest neighbors, the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> were most often the expedition's trading partners. <span class="tei_name">Coboway's</span> people soon realized that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not ordinary traders in search of fur. Quickly readjusting their own marketing strategies, the Indians were ready to provide produce, not pelts. Beginning in early December 1805, Indian canoes came up the <span class="tei_name">Netul</span> loaded with a wide variety of foodstuffs. Believing that the explorers' tastes were much like their own, native merchants brought quantities of wappato, fish, salal berry cakes, shannetahque (cured edible thistle root), and culhomo (seashore lupine root). Those same canoes also held stacks of hats, bags, mats, and an occasional dog. Sea otter and elk skins were usually offered for sale by traders not familiar with the market conditions. Shrewd dealers as they were, the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> quickly grasped the expedition's needs and increasingly offered what would sell.</p>
               <p>
The <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> market was never as busy or as noisy as the corn exchange at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. During the nearly four months the explorers lived on the coast, Indians came to trade on only twenty-four days. The fort was never a major market stop, something a party of <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span> made plain when they refused to sell all their wappato there, preferring to vend it at the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> for whale blubber. <a href="#n0811" id="ln0811" class="ref_link"><sup>[11]</sup></a> If native sellers tried to cater to <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> needs without abandoning traditional trade patterns, white buyers were equally selective in what they purchased. Prices too high or quality too low were sure grounds for no sale. On well over half of the trading days, goods offered by Indians were rejected or a partial purchase was made. Selective buying meant that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> obtained foodstuffs that were reasonably priced and of good quality while rejecting higher-priced items. In all this there must have been a great deal of haggling conducted by signs and an occasional phrase in the trade jargon.</p>
               <p>
It did not take <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> long to learn that "those people ask generally double and tribble the value of what they have to sell, and never take less than the real value of the article in such things as is calculated to do them service." At that rate, the expedition's stock of merchandise was bound to diminish with alarming speed. Once lavish in their gifts to Indians along the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, the explorers were reduced to a very short supply of trade goods. Gone were the calico shirts, brass combs, and "small cheap looking glasses" that so charmed the Indians up the big river and across the <span class="tei_name">Great Divide</span>. What remained was a motley collection of fishhooks, brass wire and armbands, moccasin awls, worn files, and beads of various colors. By early January 1806, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> complained, "Our merchandize is reduced to a mear handfull." Despite an inventory that could fit into two handkerchiefs, trade continued. Throughout the dismal winter months, the expedition purchased roots, berries, and fish. The rain-shedding qualities of <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> hats so impressed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> that they had some made especially to their own head measurements. Unfortunately, the journals are silent on the price paid to Indian women for such custom-fitted articles. Wappato continued a major item, so important that <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> made at least one special trip upriver just to locate a fresh supply of the roots. <a href="#n0812" id="ln0812" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Even with the limited number of trade contacts, there were problems. Those difficulties were not so much disagreements about price or quality as misunderstandings over trading protocol and etiquette. Each partner had rules and believed they should be obeyed, even if his opposite number neither understood nor agreed to those rules. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expected the Indians to follow the new orders about leaving the fort at sunset. Four <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span> who had been trying to sell roots at rather high prices proved "very forward" and left the fort "with relictiance" when confronted with the new orders. <a href="#n0813" id="ln0813" class="ref_link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Perhaps the most memorable case of trade involved the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span> and his family. It was <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span> who welcomed <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to "Dried Salmon" village in December 1805, and the two men soon struck up something of a friendship. When the Indian was sick, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> thoughtfully sent a piece of cinnamon to cheer him. On the day before Christmas 1805, <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span>, his younger brother, and two women appeared at the fort. Seated on the ground before the captains, the Indian ceremoniously laid out a supply of mats and roots. Whether this was a gift or goods offered for trade is not clear now and may not have been so to the explorers. Later in the evening <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span> asked for several metal files. If the mats and roots were gifts, then the Indian had every reason to think that a reciprocal present would be offered. Plainly confused by what was going on, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> announced that no files were available and abruptly returned <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar's</span> goods. Undaunted, the Indian then offered the captains the services of the two women in his party. When this gesture was rebuffed, <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span> was displeased and the women "highly disgusted." <a href="#n0814" id="ln0814" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Whether or not sales were made, and cultural confusions aside, trading did provide the Indians and the explorers a small space of common ground in an otherwise suspicious atmosphere. The cultures of both groups shared many economic values and practices. Each placed great emphasis on acquiring material wealth and measured personal status by that wealth. Individuals who excelled as traders were praised for their skill and rewarded for their enterprise. Yankee capitalists, no less than <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span>, expected every business contact to have an almost balletlike quality in which both buyer and seller spent hours dancing around each other offering price and counterprice. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> learned that lesson when he spent a full day dickering with an Indian over the relative values of a watch and some sea otter pelts, only to have the whole transaction come to naught. Like the New England shopkeeper or the backcountry merchant, the <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> trader knew when to hold his ground and when to sell quickly. Sea otter pelts that cost fathoms of blue beads one day might go the next for half a twist of tobacco or some castoff clothing. Had circumstances been different and the traders his own cultural kin, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> might have meant as praise his description of Indian merchants as "close dealers" who would "Stickle for a very little, never close a bargin except they think they have the advantage." <a href="#n0815" id="ln0815" class="ref_link"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> called <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> "the most eligable Situation for our purposes," no expeditionary assignment proved harder to define or more elusive to execute than diplomatic relations with the coastal peoples. When the Corps of Discovery struggled up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and wintered at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> its diplomatic agenda was very plain. It included proclaiming United States sovereignty, establishing legal relations with native peoples, and surveying the northern and western boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase. Equally important was extending the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>-based American trade empire, something essential in <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> vision of a West more commercial than colonial. The tactics <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> employed in pursuing those goals ranged from confronting Canadian traders and meeting with native leaders to forming, ever so slowly, an alliance of villagers against pro-British nomads. Flags, medals, presents, client chiefs, and full-dress parades—all this <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> inherited from a long tradition of Indian-white diplomacy that stretched back to eastern forests.</p>
               <p>
But what seemed so clear on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and within the bounds of the newly purchased lands became less plain on the other side of the mountains. Despite <span class="tei_name">Robert Gray's</span> effective discovery of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span> in 1792, the infant American Republic had neither the power to proclaim sovereignty in the Northwest nor was this <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> immediate intention. The president did explain to <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> in 1803 his desire to shift control of the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> fur trade out of British hands at <span class="tei_name">Nootka Sound</span> to an America post near the headwaters of the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. <a href="#n0816" id="ln0816" class="ref_link"><sup>[16]</sup></a> On the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, American efforts aimed at diminishing British influence involved complex attempts to rearrange Indian-trader alliances and recast tribal politics. Promoting peace among tribes, offering weapons and American military protection, promising to bring vast stores of trade goods—all were diplomatic strategies toward that end. But down the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, American interests were less clear. Thinking that their <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> diplomacy had succeeded, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have attempted to create similar economic alliances on the coast. The effort to patch up quarrels between Sahaptian and Chinookan speakers at <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> suggests such diplomacy had not been entirely abandoned. But at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found no open tensions to resolve, nor were they certain of their own authority. And, of course, if most Indians did not think the writ of the young Republic ran even as far as the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                  , it surely could not cross the mountains to touch the lives of the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span>.</p>
               <p>
What passed for diplomacy during the winter among the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> began even before the expedition settled along the <span class="tei_name">Netul</span>. Contacts with the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span>-proper started in mid-November 1805 on something less than a friendly note. Angered by an attempt to steal guns from the expedition, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> bluntly informed the Indians that anyone seen near the baggage would be shot. Two days later, on November 17, a man identified only as "the principal chief of the <span class="tei_name">Chinnooks</span>" appeared at the American camp. Since neither the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> nor any of their neighbors were tribes with unified political leadership but were autonomous villages, this man could have been any one of several headmen. The expedition's records are equally unhelpful in revealing what took place between the captains and their visitor except that the explorers now knew the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> to be "noumerous" and "well armed with fusees." <a href="#n0817" id="ln0817" class="ref_link"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
It was not until later in November, with the expedition still camped on the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, that any recorded diplomatic exchanges with the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> took place. On November 20, as <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and his party returned from their <span class="tei_name">Cape Disappointment</span> reconnaissance, they found the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> chiefs <span class="tei_name">Comcomly</span> and <span class="tei_name">Chillarlarwil</span> with <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>. There are no journal entries by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> for this period, so what passed between the explorer and the chiefs is not known. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> reported only that the two Indians were given medals and one was additionally favored with a flag. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> usually linked such objects to accepting American sovereignty and the essentials of federal Indian policy. But neither at this meeting nor at any other during the winter did the explorers make any promises or require the Indians to submit to American control. Hindered by language problems and mutual wariness, diplomacy with the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> proceeded at a glacial pace. <a href="#n0818" id="ln0818" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Despite the fact that the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> were the largest, best-armed, and most influential native group at the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made no effort to build on their initial talks. They did not venture across the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> to visit <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> villages, nor did they invite chiefs like <span class="tei_name">Comcomly</span>, <span class="tei_name">Chillarlawil</span>, or <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> to council at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. For explorer-diplomats who had been instructed to redirect the fur trade toward American posts, this was a strangely passive way to go about it.</p>
               <p>
Throughout the long winter on the coast there was only one other formal meeting with a <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> chief. Near the end of February 1806, <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop's</span> routine was interrupted by the arrival of <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> and some twenty-five <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> men. This was the largest Indian delegation to come to the fort, and no doubt some in the expedition nervously fingered their weapons during their stay. Any fears about <span class="tei_name">Taucum's</span> intentions, however, were quickly laid to rest. The <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> chief had been dealing peacefully with white traders for more than a decade, and he was not about to endanger such good relations or to attack well-armed men. <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> evidently came to the fort more out of curiosity than a serious interest in negotiation. There was, after all, nothing to negotiate, nor were the white strangers real traders. Whatever his motives, the chief made it plain that his was a friendly call. Impressed by his good looks and taller-than-average stature, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> gave <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> as warm an official welcome as they ever offered any costal chief. The Indian and his entourage were fed and "plyed plentifully with smoke." Throughout the afternoon <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> and his friends enjoyed food and tobacco but evidently had no interest in hearing about the ideas of the "great chief of the Seventeen great nations." Almost as an afterthought, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> presented the chief with a medal. <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> "seemed much gratified" but many have believed that it was no more than his just due. If the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> thought the medal was a sign of the expedition's trust and good will, he was quite mistaken. At sunset <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> an his party were hustled unceremoniously out of the fort as if they were an unwelcome set of traders selling rotten fish. As if to justify such inhospitable conduct, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote a long, vindictive journal entry filled with frightening images of treacherous Indians lurking around the fort ready to pounce on unsuspecting explorers. <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> may have been secure that night, but closing the gates at dusk was hardly a way to impress important and powerful neighbors. <a href="#n0819" id="ln0819" class="ref_link"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomatic relations with neighbors across the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> proved oddly inconclusive, much the same was the case in their dealings with the nearby <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span>. Those Indians, some four hundred strong living in three autonomous villages, had several chiefs, including <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Shanoma</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Warhalott</span>. <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span>, known to the explorers as <span class="tei_name">Comowooll or Conia</span>, was the only <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> chief who had any recorded contact with the expedition. Early in December, with <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> still under construction, <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> led two canoes of his folk to pay a call on the white newcomers. The chief exchanged some wappato, shannetahque, and a small sea otter pelt for some fishhooks and a small sack of 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni</span>
                   tobacco. Despite the bustle of construction, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> treated the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> delegation "with as much attention as we could." <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> was given a medal, but with trade goods already in short supply, others in the delegation probably found American hospitality somewhat meager on the material side. <span class="tei_name">Coboway's</span> visit predated the regulations limiting overnight stays, so the chief spent the night with the explorers. <a href="#n0820" id="ln0820" class="ref_link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> From <span class="tei_name">Coboway's</span> point of view, the visit had mixed results. He must have been pleased with the attention paid to him, but the evident poverty of the explorers was disappointing. If <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> thought he had scored a victory in having <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> on his side of the river, he never pressed that advantage, nor did the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> see the expedition's wintering place as a slight aimed at them. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made no promises to any chief and evidently sought nothing more than a friendly but distant relationship.</p>
               <p>
During the winter, the explorers were visited by two other delegations from nearby villages. In each case, the Indians took the initiative in making contact with the Americans. At the end of December, a young <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakum</span> chief and several people from his village came up the <span class="tei_name">Netul</span> for trade and talk. Once again, expedition records do not reveal what, if any, official words passed between the chief and the captains. The <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakum</span> was given a small medal and, like the <span class="tei_name">Assinboin</span> band chief <span class="tei_name">Chechank</span> at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, a piece of ribbon to put on his hat. <a href="#n0821" id="ln0821" class="ref_link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Early in January, the <span class="tei_name">Cathlemat</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Shahharwarcap</span> and eleven men ventured to the fort. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> gave the chief a medal of the smallest size and in return received some wappato and tobacco. Following protocol, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> then offered some twine for a skimming net. After some time in trading, <span class="tei_name">Shahharwarcap</span> was escorted out of the fort at sunset and spent the night in the woods. <a href="#n0822" id="ln0822" class="ref_link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> These contacts with <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakum</span> and <span class="tei_name">Cathlamet</span> chiefs hardly qualify as talks, but they did round out a network of reasonably friendly relations between <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> and the surrounding villages.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> diplomacy at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> was characterized by modest goals and relative inaction. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> there had been a sense of urgency in talks with the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   and <span class="tei_name">Hidatsas</span>. The captains had had a clear picture of United States interests on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, even if their grasp of tribal politics had been less sure. But similar clarity was lacking at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. American interests in <span class="tei_name">the Pacific</span> Northwest were as yet unformed. The trade empire <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> represented was centered in the <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span> of the Chouteau brothers and <span class="tei_name">Manuel Lisa</span>, not the <span class="tei_name">New York</span> of <span class="tei_name">John Jacob Astor</span>. Here the explorers were uncertain of and uninterested in village and band rivalries. It is revealing that <span class="tei_name">Comcomly</span>, the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> headman who emerged in the period after <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as the most powerful political leader in the area, never visited <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. Whatever diplomatic initiatives there were during the winter came from the Indians themselves. It was very rare for whites to winter in the region, and the natives' visits to the fort may be interpreted as an effort to determine the intentions of the expedition. If there was a network of "understandings" binding the Indians and the explorers, it was the result of action by the former. By the second winter, the explorers had expended not only the material substance of diplomacy but much of their intellectual capital as well. Perhaps it seemed enough to fulfill the forms of diplomacy with the few remaining flags and medals, leaving the substance to others.</p>
               <p>
If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were reluctant traders and inactive diplomats, they better fulfilled their ethnographic responsibilities. The <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> diaries are enlivened with a wealth of information on lower <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> life, including drawings of weapons, canoes, and the tools of daily life. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had used a wide variety of techniques to gather and preserve information about the Indians: interviews, direct observation, participation in ceremonies, and collection of artifacts. The results of that considerable effort were recorded in journals, maps, and the impressive "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." Knowing what they did well and what was possible, the expedition's ethnographers centered on describing Indian material culture. If past experience meant anything, the expedition was admirably prepared to document the lives of the coastal people. That the <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> ethnographic achievement proved somehow less major than expected was the result of a whole battery of information gathering problems, some beyond the expedition's control and others of its own making.</p>
               <p>
It has become a historical commonplace to describe the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> encountered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> as "a decadent stock." In a burst of rhetoric more colorful than accurate, Bernard De Voto branded the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> and their kin as "dullwitted, thievish, lying, [and] rotten with gonorrhoea and the pox" <a href="#n0823" id="ln0823" class="ref_link"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Although others have not written such powerful slander, students of the expedition have often assumed that <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> life was somehow a "culture in decline." This latter-day estimate would have astonished everyone from white traders and explorers to the Indians themselves. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> came to the coast in 1805, they found a thriving people fully at one with a bountiful physical environment. Arguments about cultural decline to the contrary, the maritime fur trade had dramatically enhanced the wealth and power of the coastal people. As one story describing the advent of metal trade goods put it, "the people bought this and the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> became rich." <a href="#n0824" id="ln0824" class="ref_link"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Like those ingenious 
                     <span class="tei_name">Mandans</span>
                   who dismantled a corn grinder to make tools more suited to their own needs, the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> bought only certain European goods and then quickly made them part of native life. The assertion that the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> were "dull-witted" would have brought looks of disbelief from white merchants who knew firsthand the talents of Indian traders. To be fair, it must be said also that there was probably no more veneral disease on the coast than at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. The expedition's experience suggests that more men had the ailment at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> than at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>. And as for the charge that the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> were liars, it is revealing that the only serious case of deception during the winter involved the expedition and not the natives. <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span>, <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span>, and the women who worked for <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt's</span> wife was neither noble nor savage. Their lives moved to a pattern often difficult for the explorers to discern. It was just as hard for the natives to comprehend the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition. <a href="#n0825" id="ln0825" class="ref_link"><sup>[25]</sup></a>

                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were always drawn to the characteristic objects of Indian life. Few items more fully symbolized native cultures on the Northwest Coast than the canoe. From the first time they saw such canoes on the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> admired their way in the water and the skill of those who paddled them through heaving river swells. From the <span class="tei_name">Tlingits</span> of <span class="tei_name">British Columbia</span> down to the coastal <span class="tei_name">Salish</span> of <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>, there were five distinctive canoe styles in use. Ranging south from <span class="tei_name">British Columbia</span> to the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span> and then up to the <span class="tei_name">Cascades</span>, the Chinook or Nootka canoe was a dominant style. The Chinook canoe, typically twenty to thirty-five feet long with a flat bottom, was quickly recognizable by its separate wood piece fitted over an undercut prow and a sharp, vertical stern. The cutwater canoe, common among lower <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span>, obtained its name from the use of a board cutwater placed on the prow. Cutwaters were often thirty to thirty-five feet long and carried ten to twelve persons and considerable cargo. Also widespread in coastal <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> and <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span> and on the lower <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> was the shovel-nose canoe. This style was the only kind used above <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>. Shovel-noses could be recognized by their distinctive sharply undercut prow and stern. This canoe was usually some fifteen feet long and maneuvered by two or three paddlers. Perhaps the most impressive and certainly the most memorable canoe in lower <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> waters was the double cutwater style. This very large canoe, usually thirty-five feet or longer, had cutwater boards at both bow and stern. More important, both ends were decorated with large carved totem animals. Finally, there were several kinds of simple hunting canoes. <a href="#n0826" id="ln0826" class="ref_link"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

In a long, illustrated journal entry dated February 1, 1806, both <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> presented detailed descriptions of four of the five canoe styles of the Northwest Coast. The first canoe in the sequence of <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> drawings was the shovel-nose. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had often seen the <span class="tei_name">Cathlamets</span> and <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span> use these small canoes around the "<span class="tei_name">marshey Islands</span>" near their villages. Second in <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> illustrated entry was the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span>, the sort of canoe that may have been frequently drawn up on the banks of the <span class="tei_name">Netul</span>. The third drawing depicted the cutwater canoe. Both explorers noted its use up to <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> as well as its unmistakable cutwater board. That feature of native naval design was something neither man had ever seen, and both admitted that on first sight they had confused the bow for the stern, perhaps thinking the board was a simple rudder. Like every outsider who ever saw the double cutwater, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were impressed by its size and ornamentation. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> drawing shows a large double cutwater with what may be a human figure on the prow and a carving, clearly of an animal, at the stern. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> visited the <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span>-<span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> village at present-day <span class="tei_name">Seaside</span>, <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span>, he measured a double cutwater but evidently either forgot or mislaid the figures when writing his entry. <a href="#n0827" id="ln0827" class="ref_link"><sup>[27]</sup></a>

               <p>
The explorers knew that there was more to say about canoes beyond simple physical characteristics. Like James G. Swan who spent three years among the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> in the 1850s, they understood that "the manufacture of a canoe is a work of great moment with these Indians." A brief but accurate discussion of construction techniques and materials completed the captains' journal entry. Impressed by the canoe themselves, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were even more taken with the skill of their builders. With a chisel made from a worn file embedded in a wooden handle, Indian craftsmen made boats marked by easy handling and graceful lines. "A person would suppose," wrote the captains, "that the forming of a large canoe like this was the work of several years; but these people make then in several weeks." It was no wonder that canoes were prized possessions not to be traded away except at the highest prices. <a href="#n0828" id="ln0828" class="ref_link"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Some of the best of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ethnography responded to <span class="tei_name">Jefferson's</span> requirement that they describe Indian "food, clothing, &amp; domestic accomodations." Throughout its journey, the expedition took careful note of Indian architecture, recording the designs and construction principles of earth lodges, tepees, brush wickiups, and on the Northwest Coast, plank houses. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first encountered plank houses around <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> and saw them with increasing frequency downriver. Drawing on observations made during the winter, they were able to describe in considerable detail the size, shape, and materials for a <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> plank dwelling.</p>
               <p>
Although there was some variety in the plank house's size and shape, depending on local circumstances and the status of the inhabitants, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found a common overall plan and structure. After finding a proper location with good access to water and enough sunlight, Indian builders excavated a pit some three to five feet deep. When finished, the pit measured anywhere from fourteen by twenty to forty by one hundred feet on its sides. A strong framework of cedar timber posts and gables was then erected over the pit. Split cedar boards were then driven into the ground vertically so that the tops of these planks could be attached to the gable rafters and eave poles. Roofs were made with thin planks, sometimes laid in a double thickness. Oval door openings often provided a place for <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> craftsmen to demonstrate their considerable carving abilities. Entrances were made to appear as animal or human mouths. When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> visited the <span class="tei_name">Cathlamet</span> village on the return journey, they noted such designs, "some of these which represented human figures setting and supporting the burthen on their shoulders." <a href="#n0829" id="ln0829" class="ref_link"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The insides of those houses were filled with the domestic clutter of <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> daily life. Sleeping mats, bowls, knives, bags, digging sticks, and clothing were only some of the items in a typical coastal household inventory. It was not until the drawings and paintings of John Webber, an artist with <span class="tei_name">Captain Cook</span> at <span class="tei_name">Nootka Sound</span>, and Paul Kane, a nineteenth-century artist, became better known that there was visual confirmation of what <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> first described. The explorers provided a catalog of the utensils that the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> used every day. Their journals contain accurate descriptions of wooden bowls, reed mats, different sizes of woven rush bags, and "neet trenchers made of wood." There is a fine account of root-digging sticks with a simple sketch to illustrate the tool. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> also made drawings of several weapons, including clubs, swords, and the common double-bladed handknife. <a href="#n0830" id="ln0830" class="ref_link"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Food and clothing did not escape the ethnographer's eyes. In a long journal entry written on a dismal, rainy day in January, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> took pains to describe "the Culinary articles of the Indians in our neighbourhood." Handsomely carved bowls, water baskets that doubled as hats, and horn spoons were all duly noted, as was the proper way to roast fish on a skewer. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> would not have recognized the word <em class="hi">ethnobotany,</em> but their observations on the natives' use of plants as a major food source has no equal in the literature of early exploration. The captains were no less attentive to <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> clothing. Despite <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> ill-tempered outburst proclaiming <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> female dress and ornament as "the most disgusting sight I have ever beheld," the journals contain remarkably precise descriptions of native dress. At one point, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> summarized: "All go litely dressed ware nothing below the waist in the coldest weather, a pice of fur around their bodies and a short robe composes the sum total of their dress, except a fiew hats, and beads about their necks arms and lets." <a href="#n0831" id="ln0831" class="ref_link"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were especially fascinated by the unique and skillfully made hats worn by Indians up and down the coast. Made of cedar and bear grass, these brimless, cone-shaped hats were often decorated with geometric or pictorial figures woven into them. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> saw a common Nootka design and described it as "faint representations of the whales, the Canoes, and the harpooners Strikeing them." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was impressed with their practical design, writing, "They are nearly waterproof, light, and I am convinced are much more durable than either chip or straw." The explorers found such hats so well-suited to endless days of rain that they purchased several for themselves, drew four pictures of them, and took one back for <span class="tei_name">Charles Willson Peale's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> museum. <a href="#n0832" id="ln0832" class="ref_link"><sup>[32]</sup></a>

               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> ethnography was never an end in itself, but was always intended for the service of government policy or commercial expansion. When <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> instructed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to learn about the "ordinary occupations" of native people, he had in mind the ways that Indian economic patterns might fit into an American trade system. Knowing that an essential part of their mission was to lay the foundations of future "commercial intercourse," the explorers paid special attention to Indian trade routes and the kinds of goods that passed along them. By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> got to <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span>, they were experienced in analyzing trade networks and their potential for the eager merchants of <span class="tei_name">St. Louis</span>. The Northwest Coast contained an exchange system every bit as extensive as that at the <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages. Had <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> been farther north, they might have had a closer look at the maritime fur trade, but their location near the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> nonetheless provided a good place to watch a stream of brass tea kettles, blue beads, wappato, and pelts pass around a circle of Indian and white hands. <a href="#n0833" id="ln0833" class="ref_link"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Despite the fact that more than one hundred American ships had been engaged in fur operations on the Northwest Coast between 1788 and 1803, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew very little about the organization or the schedule of that trade. When he gathered his notes and began writing about coastal trade, he did not know whether traders who visited the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> came from <span class="tei_name">Nootka Sound</span> or made the river their first stop on voyages direct from <span class="tei_name">England</span> or the United States. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was equally unsure about the existence of a trading post somewhere on the <span class="tei_name">Pacific</span> coast south of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. Strangely enough, the explorer did not even appear aware of the role of <span class="tei_name">Hawaii</span> as an important resupply point, although he speculated that "some island in the <span class="tei_name">pacific ocean</span>" was perhaps being used in the trade. From Indians, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> learned that traders came to the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> in April, anchored at <span class="tei_name">Bakers Bay</span>, and stayed some six or seven months. More important, he was able to learn what sort of goods the Indians were anxious to obtain. Those goods ranged from high quality two- and three-point blankets and coarse cloth to sheet copper and brassware. Also in demand were knives, fishhooks, pots, kettles, and firearms. The <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> enjoyed sporting European fashions, making castoff sailors' clothing an item for exchange. Of course, there was always a market for blue beads, known in the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> trade jargon as <em class="hi">tyee-kamosuk</em> or "chief beads." In return, the maritime traders obtained dressed and undressed elk skins, sea otter and beaver pelts, and so <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> thought, dried salmon. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew that vast quantities of pounded fish came down from <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> market but frankly could not understand why white traders wanted it. Later he discovered that he had misinterpreted Indian information. The salmon was not meant for the sailors but was part of a large domestic trade of which the tall ships were only a small part. <a href="#n0834" id="ln0834" class="ref_link"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The extensive native trade network also got the expedition's attention. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> knew about the role of <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> as "the great mart for all the country." After further investigation, he better understood the flow of pounded salmon and European goods up and down the river. Typical of the exchanges that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was able to trace were a variety of products from blubber and whale oil to wappato and beads. On one day in January, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> watched <span class="tei_name">Cathlamet</span> canoes loaded with upriver wappato destined for the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> towns. At those towns the wappato would be traded for blubber and oil, items the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> obtained from their <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> neighbors. The <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span>, rich in European trade goods, paid for the whale products with beads and metal. "In this manner," explained <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "is a trade continually carryed on by the natives of the river each trading some article or other with their neighbors above and below them; and thus articles which are vended by the whites at the enterence of this river, find their way to the most distant nations enhabiting its waters." <a href="#n0835" id="ln0835" class="ref_link"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Whenever <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> ventured beyond describing objects to write about the "character" of an Indian group they ran afoul of powerful stereotypes that had long been a part of the Euro-American frontier experience. The explorers could and did have good relations with individual Indians, but when they tried to evaluate whole cultures, traditional attitudes and categories almost always came to the surface. Until they reached the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made do with two stereotypes for Indians. There were the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> villagers, potential American customers and allies. In the explorers' eyes, these were the good Indians, sometimes childlike and potentially dangerous but good nonetheless. Baptized by reason of their trade potential, cultural salvation was extended to the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                  , and 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perces</span>
                  . The 
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux</span>
                   and the <span class="tei_name">Assinboins</span> formed a second image. These natives <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> judged harshly, not necessarily because they were nomads but for their links to British traders. This negative evaluation was not unchangeable. If <span class="tei_name">Black Buffalo's</span> warriors abandoned their English friends, they might be redeemed and welcomed into the American congregation. Such attitudes were intellectually satisfying and practically useful; they provided quick reference points as the expedition moved through a maze of Indians in an unknown land. Facial features, treatment of women and the elderly, differing traditions of hospitality toward strangers, economies of hunting and farming, even the sounds of language—all of these could be put into familiar mental pictures that made the world comprehensible.</p>
               <p>
But in the Northwest those reassuring images were challenged in disturbing ways. Here were people who made graceful caneos but flattened the heads of their children, carved beautiful designs on wooden bowls but squatted like frogs, and bargained with Yankee skill but had a language that sounded like hens clucking. The <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> simply did not fit into any convenient mental category. They were villagers who did not farm and warriors who preferred trade to combat. How could they be "Indians" when they did not look or act like any "Indian" the expedition had yet encountered? Confronted with human beings and cultural patterns that did not conform to the familiar categories, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> fell back on intellectual positions prepared by previous generations of Indian-white contact. At a moment when it might have been possible to escape the thrall of perceptions that had held Europeans since the Age of Reconnaissance, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> chose to reassert the familiar themes of native treachery and brutality. Language more suited to the bloody engagements in the <span class="tei_name">Ohio</span> country of the 1790s was conferred on the coastal people. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had a singular chance to see the Indians beyond stereotype; to see them as inventive, adaptable men and women living prosperous lives between the mountains and the sea. That the explorers failed to transcend their own past is a measure of how deeply rooted those mental categories had become for white Americans.</p>
               <p>
When <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> offered negative evaluations of the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> they usually focused on two features of coastal life, one physical and the other behavioral. There is no doubt that they found the shape of <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> and coastal peoples unattractive. Like other Euro-Americans, the explorers were conditioned to admire tall, slender bodies. Thin lips, narrow noses, and small feet were all essential parts of the body beautiful. Although the plains and plateau Indians came close to that image, the river and coastal folk surely did not. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> repeatedly used the words "low," "illy formed," and "badly made" to describe <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> bodies. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> wrote, "They are low in stature, rather diminutive and illy shapen; possessing thick broad flat feet, thick ankles, crooked legs, wide mouths, thick lips, nose moderately large, fleshey, wide at the extremity with large nostrils, black eyes and black coarse hair." <a href="#n0836" id="ln0836" class="ref_link"><sup>[36]</sup></a> Although its unflattering aspects were surely intended, this physical portrait is generally accurate. More important, it does not directly engage in the kinds of racial typing common later in the century, nor is its language as harsh as that used by later travelers to the coast. It is worth recalling that the most vindictive thing said about Indians in the extant journals—<span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> cruel characterization of hungry men eating uncooked meat as savage brutes—described 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , not <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span>.</p>
               <p>
But the behavior of some coastal Indians was hardly endearing. From <span class="tei_name">The Dalles</span> down to the coast, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were troubled by repeated incidents of theft. Those thefts posed two quite distinct problems. Plainly the expedition could not afford to lose tools, weapons, and valuable trade goods. But on another level, the explorers found persistent theft a habit hard to understand. Differing concepts of property, notions of communal sharing, increased commercialization of native life, and theft as an attention-getting tactic were all explanations that did not occur to the ethnographers in the expedition. Instead, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> speculated that thievery was an irreducible part of the coastal Indians' psyche. "I therefore believe," he wrote, "this trait in their character proceeds from an avaricious all grasping disposition." <a href="#n0837" id="ln0837" class="ref_link"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The captains may not have liked their <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> neighbors nor wanted their constant company, but at the same time, they said very positive things that must not be overlooked. Indeed, they had as many favorable things to say about the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> as they had about plains or plateau Indians. For all the talk about "badly made," thievish natives, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> found <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> and his kin "mild inoffensive people." Hospitality toward strangers was evident when <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> visited a <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> house and was treated with "extrodeanary friendship." The explorers were equally impressed with <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> family life, noting that "the greatest harmoney appears to exist among them." "Cheerful but never gay," possessed with "good memories," "very loquacious and inquisitive," the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> may have sometimes seemed like transplanted Yankee peddlars—not a wholly flattering estimate, come to think of it, from men with <span class="tei_name">Virginia</span> and backcountry roots. <a href="#n0838" id="ln0838" class="ref_link"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
By the time <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> wintered at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, they had settled on several ways to record ethnographic information. Journals, maps, vocabularies, artifacts, and tabular estimates were all familiar parts of their ethnography. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, the bulk of material about the Indians was written by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> in long journal entries. Each entry was a miniature essay on a particular aspect of Indian material culture or behavior. On subjects ranging from trade routes and hunting techniques to clothing styles and burial practices, <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> essays represent a substantial achievement in the history of ethnography. They reflect his keen powers of observation and a remarkable ability to bring objects alive with words. <a href="#n0839" id="ln0839" class="ref_link"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Although the journals of the captains hold much valuable information about the Indians, the same cannot be said of the diaries kept by Sergeants <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> and <span class="tei_name">Gass</span>. Earlier in the voyage, <span class="tei_name">Ordway</span> often had recorded telling bits of native life. The look of an <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> cornfield or the unique sound of the <span class="tei_name">Salish</span> language were things that he would not miss putting in his journal. <span class="tei_name">Gass</span> could be equally observant, especially about Indian houses. But during the winter on the coast, the sergeants' powers of observation declined. For reasons that are not clear, their journals are thin and without significant ethnographic value.</p>

Perhaps the greatest advance in ethnographic recording at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> was the inclusion of illustrations in the journals. Drawings had appeared briefly when the party spent time with the <span class="tei_name">Lemhi</span>
                  
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , but at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> the illustrative art flowered. Whatever the cause for the drawings, whether sheer boredom or genuine interest in new subjects, these visual records provide a new dimension to the expedition's ethnography. Sketches of North Coast hats, swords, clubs, knives, and arrows dot the journal pages, as do drawings of fishhooks, digging sticks, canoes, and paddles. These drawings continue to enliven our understanding of <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> life. Most striking is <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> simple but powerful set of sketches depicting <span class="tei_name">Chinookan</span> heads and a head-flattening cradleboard. <a href="#n0840" id="ln0840" class="ref_link"><sup>[40]</sup></a> The quality and perceptiveness in the <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> drawings makes one wish that the captains had discovered their artistic gifts earlier and practiced them longer.</p>
               <p>
The comprehensive "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" had been the lasting ethnographic accomplishment to come out of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> attempted a similar estimate for western Indians but with far less success. Abandoning the interrogative and comparative structure that made the eastern estimate so valuable and remarkable, the explorers settled for a simple list of tribes, bands, and villages with populations given in numbers of lodges and persons. The "Estimate of Western Indians" was begun at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, revised during the return journey, and further annotated by <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> when the expedition had ended. In organization, the western estimate is a straightforward recital of native groups, moving from the 
                     <span class="tei_name">Shoshonis</span>
                  , 
                     <span class="tei_name">Flatheads</span>
                  , and several 
                     <span class="tei_name">Nez Perce</span>
                   bands to the <span class="tei_name">Yakimas</span>, <span class="tei_name">Wanapams</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Walulas</span> encountered at the junction of the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span> and <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> rivers. The estimate enumerates the <span class="tei_name">Columbia River</span> Sahaptians and <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span>, reaching east to the <span class="tei_name">Shahala or Cascade Indians</span>. Then applying an unusual economic or botanical standard, the explorers list bands from the <span class="tei_name">Cascades of the Columbia</span> to the <span class="tei_name">Cowlitz River</span> as "wappato Indians." These include the <span class="tei_name">Clatskanies</span>, a number of groups living around <span class="tei_name">Wappato or Sauvies Island</span>, and the <span class="tei_name">Skilloots</span>. Moving to the coast, the estimate records the <span class="tei_name">Wahkiakums</span>, <span class="tei_name">Cathlamets</span>, <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span>-proper, and <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span>.</p>
               <p>
Because <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never traveled farther south along the <span class="tei_name">Oregon</span> coast than the <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> village of <span class="tei_name">Necost</span>, their information on groups much past <span class="tei_name">Cape Lookout</span> was very sketchy. The explorers knew the names and locations of the <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> towns around <span class="tei_name">Tillamook Bay</span>. Perhaps based on information gathered during <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> visit, the estimate contains a list of Salish and Yakonan speakers south to <span class="tei_name">Cape Blanco</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Rogue River</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had even less information from the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span>-proper north along the coast. The few contacts with <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> during the winter made the estimate of those in the northern reaches meager indeed. Under one entry, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> listed a number of groups along the <span class="tei_name">Washington</span> coast as far north as the <span class="tei_name">Quinaults</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Olympic Peninsula</span>. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> made his brief reconnaissance up the <span class="tei_name">Willamette River</span> on the return journey, listings were added for bands and peoples commonly known as the <span class="tei_name">Multnomahs</span>. Also noted were groups of Sahaptian speakers living on the middle <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> above the <span class="tei_name">Snake</span>-<span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> junction. For all the care <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> took with it, the western estimate has a barebones quality. Whether it was a failure of energy, imagination, or information, the document did not meet the standard set at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. <a href="#n0841" id="ln0841" class="ref_link"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
The weaknesses in the "Estimate of the Western Indians" reflect the deeper problems that made <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> ethnography less successful than the studies undertaken a winter earlier. The explorers had not abandoned their commitment to "name the nations," nor had they suddenly lost their descriptive skills. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were up against a battery of information-gathering problems, some of their own making and others simply beyond remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> had been ideally situated for ethnographic field work. Two <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> villages and three <span class="tei_name">Hidatsa</span> ones were close by. Because these villages were the center for northern plains trade, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had access to Indian information far beyond the range of their own travels. If <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> was set at what geographer John Allen has aptly termed "the keystone of the upper <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> region," <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> was isolated in a cultural backwater. <a href="#n0842" id="ln0842" class="ref_link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Only one small <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> village was within easy walking distance. The <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> villages on the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> seemed as remote as the <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> towns to the south.</p>
               <p>
Compounding the physical isolation at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> was the restrictive visiting policy discussed above. Unfortunately, the evening curfew was enforced in an atmosphere of fear and distrust. Then, too, the coastal Indians did not find the white men a novelty and were disappointed by their slim store of trading goods. The result was far fewer Indian visitors than there had been at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> and a sketchier ethnographic record. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> may have felt more secure with fewer Indians about, but their cultural isolation yielded a written record long on objects and short on those who made and used them. <a href="#n0843" id="ln0843" class="ref_link"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
That mental and physical distance from Indians meant fewer native informants. Even with Indians like <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span>, <span class="tei_name">Cuscalar</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt</span>—men who visited the fort fairly regularly—<span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never developed the sort of rapport they had had with <span class="tei_name">Black Cat</span>, <span class="tei_name">Sheheke</span>, or many other <span class="tei_name">Mandan</span> Indians. Some of that difficulty was a matter of language. However difficult and time-consuming the translations at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, at least the words and sentences had been forthcoming. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, translation was much more difficult. No one in the party could speak the Chinookan language, and the explorers evidently picked up only a rudimentary knowledge of the trade jargon. Over and over, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> lamented: "I cannot understand them sufficiently to make any enquiries." <a href="#n0844" id="ln0844" class="ref_link"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
During the winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, many of the gaps in Indian information could be filled by traders like <span class="tei_name">Jusseaume</span>, <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Heney</span>. At <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, there was no comparable group of knowledgeable whites for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> to question. Already hemmed in by inhospitable weather, miserable food, and a strange language, the absence of helpful traders deepened the expedition's isolation and ignorance.</p>

               <p>
The winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> wore on in days of cold drizzle. The men habitually noted in their journals that "nothing worthy of notice occurred today." No sooner had the fort been built than the whole party began "counting the days which seperate us from the 1st of April and which bind us to <span class="tei_name">fort Clatsop</span>." <a href="#n0845" id="ln0845" class="ref_link"><sup>[45]</sup></a> In the routine of hunting, cooking, mending, and salt-boiling, several incidents stand out to reveal the lights and shadows of personal relations between the explorers and the Indians. Some of these are no more than snapshots from the <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> family album, but at least two might be short films on the subject of friendship betrayed.</p>
               <p>
At <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, Indians and explorers had been allies in a struggle to survive a plains winter. But at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> their relationship was at best an armed truce. Yet there must have been moments, especially at trading times, when something like the atmosphere of that plains winter crept into the <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> compound. The <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> were convivial folk who enjoyed storytelling and good company. Their zest for life was reflected in a delight with bargaining that went beyond business into the realm of sport. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> never recorded any of the arresting tales in coastal oral tradition, nor do their journals contain any hints of the actual words that passed between Indians and whites. But in a memorable entry written by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, there is a hint of those brief times when neighbors shared trade and food. "With us," he recalled, "their conversation generally turns upon the subjects of trade, smoking, eating or their women; about the latter they speak without reserve in their presents, of their every part, and of the most formiliar connection." <a href="#n0846" id="ln0846" class="ref_link"><sup>[46]</sup></a> In journal entries usually empty of an Indian presence, this is an especially vivid picture. Earthy talk, a sly wink or pointed finger, and the forceful way the <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span> blew smoke from their lungs—all lent a flash of color to otherwise gray days.</p>
               <p>
Talk about that "most formiliar connection" is a reminder that sexual liaisons with Indian women had been part of the life of the expedition at least since the time at the <span class="tei_name">Arikara</span> villages. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> certainly was not surprised, and he wisely purchased the proper medical supplies in <span class="tei_name">Philadelphia</span> to cope with venereal disease. The captains simply accepted sexual relations as part of frontier life and were worried only if they endangered the expedition's health or security. It is probably safe to say that "Louis Veneris" was an unpaid, unenlisted, but ever-present member of the Corps of Discovery throughout its long voyage.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> once wrote that <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> women were "lude and carry on sport publickly," and added that "the <span class="tei_name">Clotsops</span> and others appear deffident, and reserved." <a href="#n0847" id="ln0847" class="ref_link"><sup>[47]</sup></a> His unflattering assessment of <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> morals and the differences in behavior of women on either side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span> brings us closer to understanding why sex was so freely offered to the Americans. With the coming of white traders in the mid-1790s, <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> women began to play an increasingly important role in an expanding native economy. Trusted by whites who perhaps feared males, <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> women soon became the principal intermediaries between fur merchants and their own kin. Women operated their own business canoes and were regularly consulted on trade matters by men on both sides of the counter. In a culture that frowned on sexual intercourse only if it involved incest, it was reasonable for these women to use their own sexual favors and those of others to make and seal trade agreements. Women who made personal and business alliances with traders enhanced the wealth of their own families. Certainly the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> who was reported to be "<span class="tei_name">Mr. Haley's</span> favorite woman" brought influence and material rewards to her family. The young woman who had "J. Bowmon" tattooed on her arm probably had a similar relationship with that trader. The plains people, concerned with acquiring spirit power, had used sex as one means to gain that end. The <span class="tei_name">Chinookans</span>, whose lives focused on trading and material wealth, saw sex as an equally valid way to amass the goods that signaled power and prestige. <a href="#n0848" id="ln0848" class="ref_link"><sup>[48]</sup></a> In a telling set of remarks made in a speech to the Mercantile Library Association of <span class="tei_name">Boston</span> in 1846, one-time coastal trader William Sturgis observed, "Among a portion of the Indians, the management of trade is entrusted to the women. The reason given by the men was, that women could talk with white men <em class="hi">better</em> than they could, and were willing to talk <em class="hi">more.</em>" <a href="#n0849" id="ln0849" class="ref_link"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Encounters with <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> women began while the expedition was still on the north side of the <span class="tei_name">Columbia</span>. Toward evening on November 21, 1805, the wife of the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> chief <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt</span> brought six women to the American camp. Their arrival prompted a brisk exchange of goods and services between young men and women who <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> admitted were "handsome." "The young women sport openly with our men" was <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> understated way of reporting what must have been quite a romp. In fact, their men were giving away goods at such alarming speed that <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were forced to call a temporary halt to the good times. Finding a ready solution, the captains "divided some ribbon between the men of our party to bestow on their favorite Lasses, this plan to save the knives and more valuable articles." <a href="#n0850" id="ln0850" class="ref_link"><sup>[50]</sup></a> These sexual contacts produced many venereal complaints, belatedly recorded by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> the following spring.</p>
               <p>
Just how often the <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> woman, now known as "the old baud," brought her following to <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> is not clear. Although <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> remained silent on the subject, there are some clues to suggest that sexual contacts were fairly regular. Exchanging goods for sex may have led to the stern prohibition against selling "any tool or iron or steel instrument, arms, accoutrements or ammunicion," issued as part of the General Order dealing with Indian-expedition relations. More specific and less circumstantial is the evidence from <span class="tei_name">Patrick Gass</span>. The sergeant reported that "the old baud" and nine girls "frequently visited our quarters." He noted that sex was available at any "easy rate," and <span class="tei_name">Nicholas Biddle</span> later commented that payment rates were fixed on the basis of female appearance. Medical evidence for all this activity is not wanting. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> alluded to "many" venereal complaints after the initial <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> meeting. Although there do not appear to have been as many cases at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> as at <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>, by January at least two men—<span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span> and <span class="tei_name">Silas Goodrich</span>—had contracted the malady. <a href="#n0851" id="ln0851" class="ref_link"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">McNeal's</span> case of "the pox" was certainly uncomfortable, but his "connection" to one <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> woman saved his life and probably rescued the expedition from involvement in a nasty confrontation. On the evening of January 9, <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> and several men were smoking with Indians at a cluster of <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> houses on the <span class="tei_name">Necanicum River</span> near the coast. At ten o'clock the quiet was shattered by loud calls from houses across the river. As many Indians rushed to investigate, <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span>
                  <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> guide told him that rumor had it someone's throat had been cut. When <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> discovered that <span class="tei_name">Hugh McNeal</span> was missing, he quickly sent <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Pryor</span> and four armed men to find him. <span class="tei_name">Pryor</span> had no sooner set out than he met <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> coming "in great haste." Regaining his composure, <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> explained that he had been invited to one of the houses by a <span class="tei_name">Tillamook</span> man. After sampling some blubber at one lodge, the two men had gone on to another. <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> did not know that the Indian was intent on killing him for his blanket and personal effects. A <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> woman described only as "an old friend of <span class="tei_name">McNeals</span>" knew of the plot and seized the American by his blanket cape in an effort to thwart the scheme. Still unaware that his life was at risk, <span class="tei_name">McNeal</span> pushed the woman away. Undaunted, she then alerted the village. In the commotion that followed, <span class="tei_name">McNeal's</span> would-be assassin escaped. <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> provided a proper ending to the whole escapade when he dubbed the <span class="tei_name">Necanicum</span> "<span class="tei_name">McNeal's Folly Creek</span>." <a href="#n0852" id="ln0852" class="ref_link"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Sex sometimes had comic overtones. When a <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> man brought his sister as payment for medical attention, the offer was swiftly rejected. Not to be denied, the woman took up residence with the <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span> family. Once her presence was known, a number of men in the expedition came knocking on her door only to find their "solicitations" turned down. After two or three days of sulking around the fort, the woman finally realized that medical bills were easier to incur than to pay. <a href="#n0853" id="ln0853" class="ref_link"><sup>[53]</sup></a> In mid-March, as the party prepared to leave <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt</span>, "the old baud," and six girls made camp outside the stockade and laid "close seige" to the expedition's affections. Fearing that the "winning graces" of the <span class="tei_name">Chinooks</span> might touch off another epidemic of venereal disease like that in November 1805 and endanger the return journey, the captains delivered a stiff lecture on the dangers that waited outside the fort. The lecture ended, at least so claimed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>, with the entire party giving "the vow of celibacy." In what must be the most inappropriate gesture in expedition history, <span class="tei_name">Delashelwilt</span> was then given a certificate of "good deportment." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> might as well have gone one step further and awarded his wife and her retinue a citation for meritorious service. <a href="#n0854" id="ln0854" class="ref_link"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Friendly talk and intimate encounters made a dismal winter bearable for at least some of the explorers. At those times the distances that separated explorer from Indian was, if not bridged, at least narrowed. But there was a darker side to Indian relations at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>, something that went beyond the indignity of the password "no <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span>" or the inhospitable treatment afforded visiting chiefs. During February and March, the expedition played out a particularly sordid tale of deception and friendship betrayed. It involved a premeditated theft of a <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> canoe in plain violation of Indian legal practice and expedition policy. Writers of detective fiction later in the century might have entitled it "The Case of the Purloined Canoe." Whatever the label, it proved a cautionary tale—one that revealed the brand of white morality confronted by the Indians in the grim years to come.</p>
               <p>
What later became a blot on the expedition's honor began simply enough in early February when some <span class="tei_name">Clatsop Indians</span> took six elk from <span class="tei_name">George Drouillard's</span> cache. Short on food, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> properly complained to <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> about the theft. Following traditional practice, the chief sent a man to the fort on February 12 with three dogs to pay for the stolen meat. This well-intentional and legally correct act went momentarily awry when the dogs bolted and ran off. But all was put right when <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> went to the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> village and retrieved the animals. As far as the Indians were concerned, the case was now closed; proper restitution had been made and accepted. There was every reason to believe that the unpleasantness at the elk cache would be forgotten. <a href="#n0855" id="ln0855" class="ref_link"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
But in March, with preparations underway for the journey home, the incident suddenly took on new life. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> knew they would need several Indian canoes to flesh out the expedition's flotilla. <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> was therefore sent to the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> village to purchase what craft he could find. He returned with some <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> and an "indifferent" canoe; the Indians refused to part with it even when offered <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> fancy-dress uniform coat. Indians remained at the fort throughout the day but would not sell their canoes "at a price which it was in our power to give consistently with the state of our stock of merchandize." <a href="#n0856" id="ln0856" class="ref_link"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
Stymied in their efforts to obtain the necessary canoes by honest trade, a plan surfaced that was at worst criminal and at best a terrible lapse of judgment. One of the interpreters—either <span class="tei_name">Drouillard</span> or <span class="tei_name">Charbonneau</span>—and several other men proposed the revival of the elk theft case as a pretext for taking a <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> canoe. As <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> blandly put it, "We yet want another canoe, and as the <span class="tei_name">Clatsops</span> will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we will take one form them in lue of the six elk which they stole from us in the winter." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not up against the wall of survival, nor was this a food emergency. The captains were abandoning a two-year tradition of never stealing from the Indians. The essential honesty that distinguished <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> from explorers like Hernando DeSoto and Francisco Pizarro had been tarnished. Expedition goods were in short supply, but experience always proved that patience in coastal trade usually yielded a satisfactory exchange. Unfortunately, patience was not the order of the day. <a href="#n0857" id="ln0857" class="ref_link"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
On the next day, March 18, an unsuspecting <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> spent the whole day at the fort. While the chief was there, four of <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> men slipped away toward his village. Knowing where the canoes were beached, they took one and brought it up near the fort. Because <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> was still there, the thieves concealed their prize nearby until he left. It had been one thing for <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> to trick <span class="tei_name">Cameahwait</span> into thinking that <span class="tei_name">Clark's</span> party was close at hand when the fate of the expedition hung in the balance at <span class="tei_name">Shoshoni Cove</span>. Even then <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted his deception "set a little awkward." It was another thing to cheat <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span>—a man <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> described as "friendly and decent," "kind and hospitable"—and not even feel a pang of conscience. <a href="#n0858" id="ln0858" class="ref_link"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>
That singular betrayal of friendship begins to make sense when projected against remarks made by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> during the period between the stealing of the elk and the stealing of the canoe. After a visit on February 20 by <span class="tei_name">Taucum</span> and a large <span class="tei_name">Chinook</span> delegation, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> launched into a vitriolic attack on the natives. Dredging up language and images rooted in two centuries of white frontier experience, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> branded the Indians as treacherous savages beyond redemption. Brushing aside any thought that the two peoples might ever be linked in genuine friendship, the explorer maintained that kindness from whites had always been repaid with brutality from Indians. "The too great confidence of our countrymen in their sincerity and friendship," exclaimed <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span>, "has caused the destruction of many hundreds of us." Turning his attention to the expedition, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> admitted that long months of good relations with Indians made it difficult to believe the party could fall victim to attack. Against that general good feeling, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> charged that the Indians did not deserve the expedition's confidence, no matter how helpful they had been. About all Indians, he declared, there was something fundamentally treacherous. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> was determined to do everything in his power to undermine any favorable impression his men had of the Indians. The central theme of Indian treachery had to be drilled into their minds. The Corps of Discovery had to be taught to hate. In phrases reminiscent of Puritan fears of the howling wilderness and savage devils, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> repeated his conviction "that our preservation depends on never loosing sight of this trait [treachery] in their character, and being always prepared to meet it in whatever shape it may present itself." <a href="#n0859" id="ln0859" class="ref_link"><sup>[59]</sup></a> With those words <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> moved from common-sense vigilance of the sort required of every explorer to a dangerous flirtation with paranoia.</p>
               <p>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> ranting was not typical of either the language or the practice of the expedition. It was not even typical of events during the <span class="tei_name">Clatsop</span> winter. But those were powerful words that demand the historian's attention and explanation. A long way from home, the expedition felt hemmed in by a strange environment and seemingly unpredictable people. Isolation, loneliness, and fear—all extract a high price from even the strongest and most moral. Such conditions often release pent-up feelings of hostility toward outsiders. <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> always had an atmosphere of "us versus them," unlike the "we" of <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span>. <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were not the first Europeans who had their moral sensibilities challenged and then eroded by the new American land. <span class="tei_name">Lewis's</span> outburst and the theft of the canoe mark a low point in expedition-Indian relations.</p>

               <p>
The winter at <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span> ended as it had begun—with overvcast skies and splatters of rain. On March 23, 1806, after giving <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> possession of their winter quarters, <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> "bid a final adieu to <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatsop</span>." <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> claimed that with the exception of not meeting any white traders, all the expedition's goals had been achieved. <a href="#n0860" id="ln0860" class="ref_link"><sup>[60]</sup></a> In most particulars his evaluation was accurate. Secured in carefully sewn elkskin bags was what amounted to a virtual catalog of western North America—its land, peoples, plants, and animals. The face of a vast portion of the continent now would be disclosed for all to see in journals, drawings, maps, vocabularies, botanical specimens, and artifacts. If <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> were disturbed that their primary mission—finding a passage through the American garden—had not yielded the result <span class="tei_name">Jefferson</span> hoped for, they did not show it. For now there was only the hurry to sever those ties that for a winter had bound them to the North Coast.</p>
               <p>
Some eight years later there was a disquieting and sad postscript to the <span class="tei_name">Fort Clatop</span> winter. On May 21, 1814, <span class="tei_name">Coboway</span> brought to the North West Company trader <span class="tei_name">Alexander Henry</span> a piece of paper the chief had carefully preserved through all those damp winters. Dated March 19, 1806, it was a list of the members of the Corps of Discovery of the Northwest. Despite their ill treatment of him, the chief obviously cherished this reminder of those his people called <em class="hi">pâh-shish-e-ooks,</em> the "cloth men." <span class="tei_name">Coboway's</span> rude introduction to the world of imperial rivalries came when <span class="tei_name">Henry</span> abruptly threw the document into a fire and then presented the chief with a British replacement. <a href="#n0861" id="ln0861" class="ref_link"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
                  <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> had done their work well. Lured by what the captains saw, those eight years had brought a flood of Astorians, Nor'-Westers, and empire builders to the Northwest. And <span class="tei_name">Coboway's</span> world had been transformed in ways hard to understand and difficult to predict.
