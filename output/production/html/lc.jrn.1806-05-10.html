This morning the snow continued falling ½ after 6 A. M. when it ceased, the air keen and cold, the snow 8 inches deep on the plain; we collected our horses and after taking a scant breakfast of roots we set out for the village of <a class="regularization" title="Broken Arm" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Broken%20Arm">Tunnachemootoolt</a>; our rout lay through an open plain course S. 35 E. and distance 16 ms.    the road was slippery and the snow clogged to the horses feet, and caused them to trip frequently.    the mud at the sources of the little ravines was deep black <a href="#n34051001" id="ln34051001" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and well supplyed with quawmash. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> turned off to the left of the road in order to hunt and did not join us this evening.    at 4 in the afternoon we decended the hills to <a class="regularization" title="Lawyer (Commearp) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lawyer%20%28Commearp%29%20Creek">Commearp Creek</a> and arrived at the Village of <a class="regularization" title="Broken Arm" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Broken%20Arm">Tunnachemootoolt</a>, <a href="#n34051002" id="ln34051002" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the cheeif at whos lodge we had left a flag last fall.    this flag was now displayed on a staff placed at no great distance from the lodge. underneath the flag the Cheif met my friend <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

This is a much greater act of hospitality than we have witnessed from any nation or tribe since we have passed the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky mountains</a>.    in short be it spoken to their immortal honor it is the only act which deserves the appellation of hospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter. <a href="#n34051004" id="ln34051004" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>    we informed these people that we were hungry and fatiegued at this moment, that when we had eaten and refreshed ourselves we would inform them who we were, from whence we had come and the objects of our resurches.    a principal Cheif by name <a class="regularization" title="Hohots Ilppilp" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hohots%20Ilppilp">Ho-hâst,-ill-pilp</a>

I was surprised to find on decending the hills of <a class="regularization" title="Lawyer (Commearp) Creek" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Lawyer%20%28Commearp%29%20Creek">Commearp Cr.</a> to find that there had been no snow in the bottoms of that stream.    it seems that the snow melted in falling and decended here in rain while it snowed on the plains.    the hills are about six hundred feet high about one fourth of which distance the snow had decended and still lay on the sides of the hills.    as these people had been liberal with is with rispect to provision I directed the men not to croud their lodge surch of food in the manner hunger has compelled them to do at most lodges we have passed, and which the <a class="regularization" title="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Twisted%20Hair%20%28Walamotinin%29">Twisted hair</a> had informed me was disgreeable to the natives.    but their previous want of hospitality had induced us to consult their enclinations but little and suffer our men to obtain provision from them on the best terms they could. The village of the broken arm as I have heretofore termed it consists of one house only which is 150 feet in length built in the usual form of sticks matts and dry grass.    it contains twenty four fires and about double that number of families.    from appearances I presume they could raise 100 fighting men.    the noise of their women pounding roots reminds me of a nail factory. The indians seem well pleased, and I am confident that they are not more so than our men who have their somachs once more well filled with horsebeef and mush of the bread of cows.—    the house of coventry is also seen here.— <a href="#n34051008" id="ln34051008" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

In the morning the weather became clear. Where we are lying in the plains the snow is about five inches deep; and amidst snow and frost we have nothing whatever to eat. Without breakfast we started to go to a village of the natives, who live on a branch of the river, about a south course from this place. We travelled through the snow about 12 miles, and then went down a long steep descent to the branch where the village is situated. When we were about half way down the hill there was not a particle of snow nor the least appearance of it. It was about 3 o'clock when we arrived at the village, <a href="#n34051014" id="ln34051014" class="ref_link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> and the Commanding Officers held a conversation with the natives, who informed them that they had not more provisions and roots, than they wanted for themselves. They, however, divided their stock with us; and told us what they had given was all they could spare; but drove up some horses and told us to shoot one, which we did. They then offered another, but that was reserved for another time, and we dressed the one we had killed; and in our situation find it very good eating. We remained here all night.
