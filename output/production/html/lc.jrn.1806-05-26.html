The Clyster given the Child last evening operated very well.    it is clear of fever this evening and is much better, the swelling is considerably abated and appears as if it would pass off without coming to a head.    we still continue fresh poltices of onions to the swolen part.    we directed the indians in what manner to treat the dieased Cheif, gave him a few dozes of flour of sulpher and Creem of tartar &amp; some portable soupe and directed them to take him home.    they seemed unwilling to comply with the latter part of the injunction for they consumed the day and remained with us all night.    at 1 P.
