This morning we were visited by a <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsop</a> man who brought with him three dogs as a remuneration for the Elk which him self and nation had stolen from us some little time since, how ever the dogs took the alarm and ran off; we suffered him to remain in the fort all night.</p>

There are two species of ever green shrubs which I first met with at the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Cascades%20%28Great%20Rapids%2C%20Great%20Shute%29">grand rappids of the Columbia</a> and which I have since found in this neighbourhood also; they grow in rich dry ground not far usually from some watercourse.    the roots of both species are creeping and celindric. the stem of the 1st <a href="#n28021201" id="ln28021201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is from a foot to 18 inches high and as large as a goosqull; it is simple unbranced and erect.    it's leaves are cauline, compound and spreading.    the leafets are jointed and oppositely pinnate, 3 pare &amp; terminating in one, sessile, widest at the base and tapering to an accuminated point, an inch and a quarter the greatest width, and 3 inches &amp; a ¼ in length.    each point of their crenate margins armed with a subulate thorn or spine and are from 13 to 17 in number.    they are also veined, glossy, carinated and wrinkled; their points obliquely pointing towards the extremity of the common footstalk.—    The stem of the 2nd <a href="#n28021202" id="ln28021202" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> is procumbent abot the size of the former, jointed and unbranched.    it's leaves are cauline, compound and oppositely pinnate; the rib from 14 to 16 inches long celindric and smooth.    the leafets 2½ inches long and 1 inch wide.    greatest width ½ inch from their base, to which they are regularly rounded, and from the same point tapering to an accute apex, wich is mostly, but not invariably tirminated with a small subulate thorn.    they are jointed and oppositely pinnate, consisting of 6 pare and terminating in one, sessile serrate, or like the teeth of a whipsaw, each point terminating in a small subulate spine, being from 25 to 27 in number; veined, smooth, plane and of a deep green, their points tending obliquely towards the extremity of the rib or common footstalk. I do not know the fruit or flower of either.    the 1st resembles the plant common to many parts of the U' States called the mountain holley.
