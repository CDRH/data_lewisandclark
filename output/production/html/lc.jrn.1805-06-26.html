The Musquetoes are extreemly troublesome to us.

Fields</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> in one of the canoes up the river to hunt Elk.    set <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazier</a> at work to sew the skins together for the covering

I collected my wood and water, boiled a large quantity of excellent dryed buffaloe meat and made each man a large suet dumpling by way of a treat.    about 4 P.
