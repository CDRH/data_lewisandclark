                  <span class="italic">Sunday 1st Sept.</span> 1805.    We set out early in a fine morning, and travelled on nearly a west course. We found here the greatest quantity and best service berries, I had ever seen before; and abundance of choak-cherries. There is also a small bush grows in this part of the country, about 6 inches high, which bears a bunch of small purple berries. Some call it mountain holly; <a href="#n22090104" id="ln22090104" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the fruit is of an acid taste. We are much better supplied with water than I expected; and cross several fine springs among the mountains through which we pass. At noon some rain fell, and the day continued cloudy. About the middle of the day <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clarke's</a> blackman's feet became so sore that he had to ride on horseback. At 3 o'clock we came to a creek, <a href="#n22090105" id="ln22090105" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> where there was fine grass and we halted to let our horses eat. There are a great number of fish in this creek. After we halted the weather became cloudy, and a considerable quantity of rain fell. We therefore concluded to remain where we were all night, having come this day 18 miles. Our hunters killed a deer, and we caught 5 fish.
