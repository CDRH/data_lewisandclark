The wind blew so hard during the whole of this day, that we were unable to move.    notwithstanding that we were sheltered by high timber from the effects of the wind, such was it's violence that it caused the waves to rise in such manner as to wet many articles in the small canoes before they could be unloaded.    we sent out some hunters who killed 4 deer &amp; 2 Elk, and caught some young wolves of the small kind.—    Soar eyes is a common complaint among the party. I believe it origenates from the immence quantities of sand which is driven by the wind from the sandbars of the river in such clouds that you are unable to discover the opposite bank of the river in many instances.    the particles of this sand are so fine and light that they are easily supported by the air, and are carried by the wind for many miles, and at a distance exhibiting every appearance of a collumn of thick smoke.    so penitrating is this sand that we cannot keep any article free from it; in short we are compelled to eat, drink, and breath it very freely. <a href="#n11042401" id="ln11042401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    my pocket watch, is out of order, she will run only a few minutes without stoping. I can discover no radical defect in her works, and must therefore attribute it to the sand, with which, she seems plentifully charged, notwithstanding her cases are double and tight.</p>

river we could not proceed. While we lay here some of the men went to see 
some water at a distance which appeared like a river or small lake. In the 
afternoon they returned, and had found it only the water of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, 
which had run up a bottom. One of the men caught six young wolves <a href="#n11042402" id="ln11042402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and 
brought them in, and the other men killed some elk and deer.
