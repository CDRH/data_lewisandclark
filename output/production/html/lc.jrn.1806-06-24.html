                  <span class="italic">Tuesday 24th.</span>    There was a cloudy morning. We gave each of the Indians a pair of mockasons, and they agreed to stay to day and wait for the party.— One of our hunters went out, but had no success. The day keeps cloudy, and the musquitoes are very troublesome. There is also a small black fly <a href="#n36062404" id="ln36062404" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> in this country, that so torments our horses, that they can get no rest, but when we 
make small fires to keep them off. At noon two hunters <a href="#n36062405" id="ln36062405" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> went on ahead to a small creek, to endeavour to kill some provision, as we cannot kill any here; and unless the party come up to night, I intend to go on with the Indians tomorrow morning. In the evening the party arrived with three more Indians, 
and we all encamped together for the night.
