                  <em class="hi">Tuesday 12th.</em>    A cloudy wet morning, after a terrible night of rain, hail, thunder and lightening. We thought it best to move our camp, and fixed our canoes and loaded them with stones to keep them down. We went about the eighth of a mile from this place, and fixed ourselves as well as we could, and remained all night. The rain still continued, and the river remained very rough.

Tuesday Novemr 12th    We had a hard storm the greater part of last night, &amp; hard thunder, lightning, &amp; hail this morning.    We saw a high mountain which lay on the opposite to where we are encamped covered with snow.    The Rain continued hard during the most part of this day.    We were employed in putting Stones in our Canoes to ballast them.    Towards evening we moved our Canoes &amp; Camp a short distance up the River; to the mouth of a creek; where our men gigged several more fine Salmon Trout.
