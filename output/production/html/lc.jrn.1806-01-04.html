I therefore believe this trait in their character proceeds from an avaricious all grasping disposition.    in this rispect they differ from all Indians I ever became acquainted with, for their dispositions invariably lead them to give whatever they are possessed off no matter how usefull or valuable, for a bauble which pleases their fancy, without consulting it's usefullness or value.    nothing interesting occurred today, or more so, than our wappetoe being all exhausted.

                  <em class="hi">Saturday 4th.</em>    The morning was wet; but we proceeded on, and passed the head of a creek <a href="#n26010402" id="ln26010402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which we supposed was the last in our rout to the <a class="regularization" title="Saltmaking Camp (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saltmaking%20Camp%20%28Oreg.%29">salt works</a>.
