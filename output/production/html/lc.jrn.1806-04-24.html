We were up early this morning and dispatched the men in surch of our horses, they were all found in a little time except <a class="regularization" title="McNeal, Hugh" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh">McNeal's</a>.    we hired an indian to surch for this horse it was one in the evening before he returned with him.    in the intermediate time we had 4 packsaddles made purchased three horses of the <a class="regularization" title="Tenino Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tenino%20Indians">Wah-howpums</a>, and hired three others of the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> man who accompanys us with his family and horses. we now sold our canoes for a few strands of beads, loaded up and departed at 2 P. M.    the natives had tantalized us with an exchange of horses for our canoes in the first instance, but when they found that we had made our arrangements to travel by land they would give us nothing for them I determined to cut them in peices sooner than leave them on those terms, <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> struck one of the canoes and split of a small peice with his tommahawk, they discovered us determined on this subject and offered us several strands of beads for each which were accepted.    we proceeded up the river between the hills and it's Northen shore.    the road was rocky and sandy alternately, the road difficult and fatieguing.    at 12 ms. we arrived at a village of 5 lodges of the <a class="regularization" title="Umatilla Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Umatilla%20Indians">Met-cow-wes</a>, <a href="#n32042401" id="ln32042401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> having passed 4 lodges at 4 and 2 at 2 Ms. further.    we ramined all night near the <a class="regularization" title="Umatilla Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Umatilla%20Indians">Met-cow-we</a> lodges about 2 miles below our encampment of the [<em class="hi">blank</em>] <a href="#n32042402" id="ln32042402" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> of October last; we purchased three dogs and some shappellel of these people which we cooked with dry grass and willow boughs.    many of the natives pased and repassed us today on the road and behaved themselves with distant rispect towards us.    most of the party complain of the soarness of their feet and legs this evening; it is no doubt caused by walking over the rough stones and deep sands after bing for some months passed been accustomed to a soft soil.    my left ankle gives me much pain. I baithed my feet in cold water from which I experienced considerable releif.

                  <em class="hi">Thursday 24th.</em> The weather was pleasant. We lost another horse last night, and were detained here this morning, looking for him. We got six horses at this place, three of which were borrowed from an Indian <a href="#n32042409" id="ln32042409" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> who was going with his family along with us. We sold our two small canoes; and at 
noon an Indian who had gone to look for the lost horse returned with him. At 2 o'clock we all started by land on the north side of the river, accompanied by several of the natives with their families and horses. We entered the low country, the great and beautiful <a class="regularization" title="Great Columbian Plain" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Great%20Columbian%20Plain">plains of Columbia</a>, and proceeded on till evening when we encamped at two mat-lodges of the natives, and got two dogs and some shapaleel. The natives who were travelling in our party encamped with us.
