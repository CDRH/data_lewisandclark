This morning I set <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazier</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a> to sewing the leather on the sides of the sections of the boat; <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">J.

M. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> arrived with the party all very much fortiegued.    he brought with him all the baggage except what he had deposited yesterday at the six mile stake, for which the party were too much fortiegued to return this evening.    we gave them a dram and suffered them to rest from their labours this evening. I directed <a class="regularization" title="Bratton, William E." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bratton%2C%20William%20E.">Bratton</a> to assist in making the tar tomorrow, and scelected several others to assist in puting the boat together.    the day has been warm and the Musquetoes troublesome of course    the bear were about our camp all last night, we have therefore determined to beat up their quarters tomorrow, and kill them or drive them from their haunts about this place. </p>
