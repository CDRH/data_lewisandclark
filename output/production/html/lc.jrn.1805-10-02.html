meat as earnest as though it had been the best meat in the world.    in the evening we bought a fiew fresh Sammon and a little Commass from the Savages who are Camped near us.

                  <span class="italic">Wednesday 2nd.</span>    Two men were sent to the Indian village to purchase some provisions, as our hunters do not kill enough for us to subsist on. And least the Indian provisions should not agree with us, we killed one of our 
horses.</p>
               <p>
On the third, the men were employed as usual; on the morning of the fourth there was a white frost, after it a fine day. In the evening our two men returned, with a good supply of such provisions as the natives have.
