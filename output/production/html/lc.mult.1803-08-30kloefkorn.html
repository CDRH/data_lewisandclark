               Left Pittsburgh this day at 11 ock with a party of 11 hands 7 of which are soldiers, a pilot and three young men on trial they having proposed to go with me throughout the voyage. Arrived at Bruno's Island 3 miles below    halted a few minutes.    went on shore and being invited on by some of the gentlemen present to try my <span class="italic">airgun</span> which I had purchased brought it on shore charged it and fired myself seven times fifty five yards with pretty good success; after which a <span class="tei_name">Mr. Blaze Cenas</span> being unacquainted with the management of the gun suffered her to discharge herself accedentaly    the ball passed through the hat of a woman about 40 yards distanc cuting her temple about the fourth of the diameter of the ball; shee fell instantly and the blood gusing from her temple    we were all in the greatest consternation    supposed she was dead by [but] in a minute she revived to our enespressable satisfaction, and by examination we found the wound by no means mortal or even dangerous
