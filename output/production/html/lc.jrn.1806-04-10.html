of the north side, <a href="#n31041010" id="ln31041010" class="ref_link"><sup>[10]</sup></a> where I saw the skin of a wild sheep, which had fine beautiful wool on it.

We proceeded on, and the water was so rapid that we had to tow the canoes up by the line almost all the way to the landing at the lower end of the portage, a distance of about six miles. In passing a bad place the tow-line of the small canoe, which the hunters had on ahead, broke; but fortunately there was nothing in her, as the three hunters were on shore dragging her up, and had taken out all the loading. <a href="#n31041012" id="ln31041012" class="ref_link"><sup>[12]</sup></a> As she passed by us <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt.
