It continued to rain moderately all last night    this morning was cloudy untill about ten oClock when it cleared off and became a fine day.    we breakfasted and set out about sunrise and continued our rout down the river bottoms through the mud and water as yesterday, tho' the road was somewhat better than yesterday and we were not so often compelled to wade in the river.    we passed some dangerous and difficult bluffs. The river bottoms affording all the timber which is to be seen in the country they are filled with innumerable litle birds that resort thither either for shelter or to build their nests.    when sun began to shine today these birds appeared to be very gay and sung most inchantingly; I observed among them the brown thrush, Robbin, turtle dove, linnit goaldfinch, the large and small blackbird, wren and several other birds of less note. <a href="#n15060801" id="ln15060801" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>    some of the inhabitants of the praries also take reffuge in these woods at night or from a storm. The whole of my party to a man except myself were fully peswaided that this river was the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a>, but being fully of opinion that it was neither the main stream or that which it would be advisable for us to take, I determined to give it a name and in honour of <a class="regularization" title="Wood, Maria" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Wood%2C%20Maria">Miss Maria W—d</a>. called it <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Maria's</a> River.    it is true that the hue of the waters of this turbulent and troubled stream but illy comport with the pure celestial virtues and amiable qualifications of that lovely fair one; but on the other hand it is a noble river; one destined to become in my opinion an object of contention between the two great powers of America and Great Britin with rispect to the adjustment of the North westwardly boundary of the former; and that it will become one of the most interesting brances of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> in a commercial point of view, I have but little doubt, as it abounds with anamals of the fur kind, and most probably furnishes a safe and direct communication to that productive country of valuable furs exclusively enjoyed at present by the subjects of his Britanic Majesty; in adition to which it passes through a rich fertile and one of the most beatifully picteresque countries that I ever beheld, through the wide expance of which, innumerable herds of living anamals are seen, it's borders garished with one continued garden of roses, while it's lofty and open forrests, are the habitation of miriads of the feathered tribes who salute the ear of the passing traveler with their wild and simple, yet s[w]eet and cheerfull melody.—    I arrived at camp about 5 OClock in the evening much fatiegued, where I found <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> and the ballance of the party waiting our return with some anxiety for our safety having been absent near two days longer than we had engaged to return.    on our way to camp we had killed 4 deer and two Antelopes; the skins of which as well as those we killed while on the rout we brought with us. <a class="regularization" title="Marias River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Marias%20River">Maria's river</a> may be stated generally from sixty to a hundred yards wide, with a strong and steady current and possessing 5 feet water in the most sholly parts.—</p>
               <p>
As the incidents which occurred <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. C.</a> during his rout will be more fully and satisfactoryley expressed by himself I here insert a copy of his journal during the days we wer seperated.— <a href="#n15060802" id="ln15060802" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
               </p>
               <p>I now gave myself this evening to rest from my labours, took a drink of grog and gave the men who had accompanyed me each a dram. <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clark</a> ploted the courses of the two rivers as far as we had ascended them. I now began more than ever to suspect the varacity of <a class="regularization" title="Fidler, Peter" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Fidler%2C%20Peter">Mr. Fidler</a> or the correctness of his instruments.    for I see that <a class="regularization" title="Arrowsmith, Aaron" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Arrowsmith%2C%20Aaron">Arrasmith</a> in his late map of N. America has laid down a remarkable mountain in the chain of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky mountains</a> called the tooth nearly as far South as Latitude 45°, and this is said to be from the discoveries of 
                     Mr. Fidler. <a href="#n15060803" id="ln15060803" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>    we are now within a hundred miles of the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, and I find from my observation of the 3rd Inst that the latitude of this place is 47° 24' 12.8".    the river must therefore turn much to the South, between this and the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky Mountain</a> to have permitted <a class="regularization" title="Fidler, Peter" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Fidler%2C%20Peter">Mr. Fidler</a> to have passed along the Eastern border of these mountains as far S. as nearly 45° without even seeing it.    but from hence as far as <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt.

I think therefore that we shall find that the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> enters the <a class="regularization" title="Rocky Mountains" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Rocky%20Mountains">rocky mountain</a>s to the North of 45°—    we did take the liberty of placing his discoveries or at least the Southern extremity of them about a degree further N. in the sketh which we sent on to the government this spring mearly from the Indian information of the bearing from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N.

Its bearing something north of west a considerable distance, and then to the south of west. The party while out killed 18 deer and some elk. From the appearance of the river where they left it to return, they supposed it might be navigable a considerable distance further. They saw no mountains ahead, but one off towards the north: <a href="#n15060806" id="ln15060806" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> it was not covered with snow like those we had seen. Both these rivers abound in fish; and we caught some of different kinds, but not large. About five o'clock in the afternoon the weather became cloudy and cold, and it began to rain.
