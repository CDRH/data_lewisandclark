The rain ceased about day, the clouds had not dispersed, and looked very much like giving us a repetition of the last evening's frallic, there was but little fogg and I should have been able to have set out at sunrise, but the Corporal had not yet returned with the bread—    I began to fear that he was 〈miffed〉 piqued with the sharp reprimand I gave him the evening before for his negligence &amp; inattention with respect to the bread and had deserted; in this however I was agreeably disappointed, about 8 in the morning he came up bring with him the two men and the bread, they instantly embarked and we set out    we passed several very bad riffles this morning at at 11 Oclock six miles below our encampment of last evening I landed on the east side of R. and went on shore to view a remarkable artificial mound of earth called by the people in this neighbourhood the Indian grave.— <a href="#n02091001" id="ln02091001" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

E. to S.

I shall therefore content myself by giving a discription of the large mound and offering some conjectures with regard to the probable purposes for which they were intended by their founders; who ever they may have been.—</p>

	the mound is nearly a regular cone 310 yards in circumpherence at it's base &amp; 65 feet high terminating in a blont point whose diameter is 30 feet, this point is concave being depressed about five feet in the center, arround the base runs a ditch 60 feet in width which is broken or intesected by a ledge of earth raised as high as the outer bank of the ditch on the N. W. side, this bank is about 30 feet wide and appers to have formed the enterence to fortifyed mound—    near the summet of this mound grows a white oak tree whose girth is 13 ½ feet, from the aged appeance of this tree I think it's age might resonably calculated at 300 years, the whole mound is covered with large timber, sugar tree, hickory, poplar, red and white oak &amp;c— <a href="#n02091004" id="ln02091004" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>  I was informed that in removing the earth of a part of one of those lesser mounds that stands in the town the skeletons of two men were found and some brass beads were found among the earth near these bones, my informant told me the beads were sent to <a class="regularization" title="Peale, Charles Willson" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Peale%2C%20Charles%20Willson">Mr. Peals</a> museum <a href="#n02091005" id="ln02091005" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> in <a class="regularization" title="Philadelphia, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Philadelphia%2C%20Pa.">Philadelphia</a> where he believed they now were.— <a href="#n02091006" id="ln02091006" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
