This morning we dispatched two hunters a head.    we had much difficulty in collecting our horses.    at 8 A. M. we obtained them all except the horse we obtained from the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Chopunnish</a> man whom we seperated from yesterday.    we apprehended that this horse would make some attempts to rejoin the horses of this man and accordingly had him as we thought securely hubbled both before and at the side, but he broke the strings in the course of the night and absconded.    we sent several men in different directions in surch of him. I engaged one of the young indians who overtook us last evening to return in surch of him.    at half after 1 P. M. The indian and <a class="regularization" title="Field, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Field%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Feilds</a> returned with the horse, they had found him on his way back about 17 Ms. I paid the indian the price stipulated for his services and we immediately loaded up and set forward.    steered East 3 M. over a hilly road along the N. side of the Creek, wide bottom on S. side.    a branch falls in on S. side <a href="#n33050201" id="ln33050201" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which runs south towards the S.

Friday 2nd May 1806.    a clear cold morning.    the men got up all but one of our best horses which they could not find. Several hunters went on up the branch a hunting. Several of the men went out in different directions to look for the lost horse.    one of them went back to where we took dinner yesterday and turned back.    was Soon overtaken by an Indian who had caught our horse &amp; was takeing him to us.    as soon as the Indians returned him to us our officers gave a tommahawk knife and a pr. overalls for the kindness.    about noon we proceeded on up the branch <a href="#n33050206" id="ln33050206" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> over high plains &amp; Smooth bottoms.    the branch forked in Several places.    high hills to our right covred with timber and partly covred with Snow.    we crossed the branch in several places, where it was 3 feet deep.    our hunters joined us in the evening.    had killed only one beaver and one otter.—    Camped <a href="#n33050207" id="ln33050207" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> on a fork of the branch    came [<em class="hi">blank</em>] mls. <a href="#n33050208" id="ln33050208" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

                  <em class="hi">Friday 2nd.</em>    A fine morning.
