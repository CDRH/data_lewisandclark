                  <span class="italic">Saturday 7th.</span>    We set out early in a cloudy cool morning; and our hunters went on as usual. We proceeded down the creek, <a href="#n22090703" id="ln22090703" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and in our way we were met by a hunter, who had not come in last night, and who had lost his horse. We halted at 12 o'clock, and one of the hunters killed 2 deer; which was a subject of much joy and congratulation. Here we remained to dine, and some rain fell. On the south of this place there are very high mountains covered with snow and timber, and on the north prairie hills. After staying here 2 hours we proceeded on down the creek; found the country much the same as that which we had passed through in the forenoon; and having travelled about 20 miles since the morning, encamped <a href="#n22090704" id="ln22090704" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> for the night. The valley is become more extensive, and our creek has increased to a considerable river.

Saturday September 7th    We had a cold, Cloudy morning.—    We set out early and proceeded on, we went down the Creek that we had encamped on.    The hunter that was out last night returned to us, he had lost his horse, &amp; had killed no game.    We proceeded on, and crossed a plain.    the bottoms along the Creek are narrow, and had a considerable quantity of Pine &amp; Cotton Wood trees growing on it.    On the South side of this Creek, lies high Mountains, which are covered with Pitch Pine.    One of our hunters came to us, and had killed 2 deer, Some others of the Hunters also came to us, &amp; had killed 1 Goose 1 Crane several ferrets <a href="#n22090709" id="ln22090709" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a> &amp; a hawk all of which they brought with them.—</p>
               <p>
Our party seemed revived at the success that the hunters had met with, however in all the hardship that they had yet undergone they never once complained, trusting to Providence &amp; the Conduct of our Officers in all our difficulties.    We had several small showers of Rain in the course of the day.    As we pursued our Journey we found the Valleys getting wider &amp; the Creek larger &amp; the plain smooth &amp; dry, but the Soil very indifferent.    We came 18 Miles this day, and encamped on the bank of the same Creek, that we had encamped on Yesterday.    We passed during this days Journey several Creeks, &amp; branches which run into the creek where we now are.—    One of our hunters did not join us this evening, our course during this day has been generally North West.—
