The essential, definitive record of the <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> expedition is contained in
the journals and observations of the two captains, "the writingest explorers of their
time," in the words of Donald Jackson. <a href="#n01" id="ln01" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> If no one else associated with the enterprise had written a word we would still have a marvelous narrative replete with geographic, zoological, botanical, and ethnographic information. In fact, however, at
least four other members of the party did set down their own daily accounts. This
edition brings them together with those of their commanders for the first time.</p>

               <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">President Thomas Jefferson</a> did not order the actual keeping of separate journals by anyone other than the captains. In his final instructions to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, however, he did suggest that "several copies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at leisure times, &amp; put into the care of the most trust-worthy of your attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will
be exposed." <a href="#n02" id="ln02" class="ref_link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> All this would seem to require is that some of the "attendants" copy
the captains' journals verbatim. Apparently <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, at an early stage, decided to do something else. On May 26, 1804, less than two weeks out from <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River
Dubois</a>, the captains noted that "The sergts . . . are directed each to keep a separate
journal from day to day of all passing accurences, and such other observations on
the country &amp;c. as shall appear to them worthy of notice.â€”" <a href="#n03" id="ln03" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

In his last communication to <a class="regularization" title="Jefferson, Thomas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Jefferson%2C%20Thomas">Jefferson</a> from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a> in April 1805, <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
wrote: "We have encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of them do so, to
whom in this respect we give every assistance in our power." <a href="#n04" id="ln04" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
               <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> had a sense of
history; in departing westward from the <a class="regularization" title="Mandan Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Mandan%20Indians">Mandan</a> villages he compared his little fleet
of pirogues and canoes to the vessels of <a class="regularization" title="Cook, James" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cook%2C%20James">Captain Cook</a>. <a href="#n05" id="ln05" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The significance of his enterprise warranted as complete a record as possible. It might be too much to ask any
enlisted men to copy their officers' voluminous journals, but those so inclined could
be encouraged to add their bit to the record.</p>
            <p>
At least some of the men who went with <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> seem to have shared that
sense of history. They were volunteers, after all, and although some of them no
doubt simply hoped to escape from irksome military discipline or to find good beaver streams, others evidently knew very well that this was the chance of a lifetime,
that they were involved in something that would survive them, something greater
than their individual contribution. The combination of that sense of history with a
degree of literacy and considerable diligence made a few of them journal keepers.</p>
            <p>
To appreciate the work of these men, let us remember the conditions under
which they wrote. Most days of the voyage involved hard physical labor, working
canoes upstream, loading and unloading bulky equipment, hunting and butchering, tanning leather, making moccasins, cooking, chopping and shaping wood, caring for horses and searching for strays, mounting guard, portaging around falls and rapids, all while exposed to every kind of weather and to the attacks of insects
and grizzly bears, with the constant danger of physical injury from accidents. At the
end of such a day, perhaps while others were dancing to <a class="regularization" title="Cruzatte, Pierre" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cruzatte%2C%20Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte's</a> fiddle, a
journal keeper would have to write by the light of a campfire in notebooks somehow
kept safe from the elements. According to <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>, seven of the thirty-odd men had
the perseverance and the sense of destiny to try.</p>
            <p>
They wrote under the same conditions as the captains, and like them wrote not
only for themselves. It seems probable that they examined each other's journals,
and perhaps <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> read them, too. We know that on July 14, 1804, having
lost his notes for the previous day, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> had "to refur to the . . . Journals of Serjeants." The enlisted men's journals were intended as part of the record; they were
public documents and we cannot expect any deep psychological revelations. No one
recorded explicitly, for example, his opinion of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Sacagawea" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>.</p>
            <p>
Literacy was the first requirement. It is probable that some of the men could not
even write their own names. Historians have expressed considerable humor over
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> awkward grammar and his versatility as a speller, but he was little worse than
many contemporaries who like him were men of affairs, government officials, and
army officers. Comparison of <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> journal with those of the enlisted men should
keep us from laughing too much at <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>. Nor should we be overly amused at the
enlisted men, for none of their journals suggests stupidity or dullness. They tried to
the best of their ability to record an extraordinary experience.</p>
            <p>
Sergeants in the army had to be literate, since they kept records for their companies, and it is not too surprising that three of the four enlisted men's journals that
we now have are those of sergeants. <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">John Ordway</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Charles Floyd</a> held that rank
from the start of the trip, and <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a> was promoted some three months out to
fill the place of the deceased <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</a> is the only private whose
journal we now have. <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway's</a> spelling and grammar are, if anything, better than
<a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a>. We cannot judge <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> performance for we do not have his original writing.
<a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a> apparently struggled with writing, but there is rarely doubt
about what they meant.</p>
            <p>
We have four enlisted men's journals, in one form or another. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> indicated
that seven men were keeping journals, and the discrepancy requires some notice,
although few hard conclusions can be made. Since the other sergeants were expected to keep journals, one would assume that <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</a> would
also do so, but no document demonstrating this has come to light. <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> served later
on as an army officer and an Indian agent, but other men filled those posts on the
frontier who could barely sign their names. On August 12, 1806, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> noted that
<a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> had left behind saddlebags containing his "papers," but <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> had just returned from being separated from the main party, and the papers could have consisted only of letters he was supposed to deliver to a Canadian trader, and perhaps
a journal of his separate trip, which began barely three weeks before. In any case,
<a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> went back and recovered the saddlebags, so the papers, whatever they were,
were not then lost. There is simply no clear evidence to show that <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> was one of
the seven journal keepers mentioned by <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>.</p>
            <p>
It is fairly certain that one private besides <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a> kept some sort of journal,
because <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Robert Frazer</a> announced his intention to publish by issuing a prospectus
soliciting subscribers barely a month after the party returned to <a class="regularization" title="Saint Louis, Mo." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Saint%20Louis%2C%20Mo.">St. Louis</a>, promising
"An accurate description of the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and its several branches; of the mountains
separating the Eastern from the Western waters; of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia river</a> and the Bay
it forms on the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>; of the face of the Country in general; of the several
Tribes of Indians on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia</a> rivers . . . ," and with all this "a
variety of Curious and interesting occurrences during a voyage of two years four
months and nine days." The account, <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a> made clear, was "Published by Permission of <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Captn. Meriwether Lewis</a>." <a href="#n06" id="ln06" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a> If the journal was anything like what <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a>
promised, that it was never published is a great pity. Given the importance of the
expedition this is surprising, especially since <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Patrick Gass</a> was able to secure publication of his work the next year and since there were six further editions of his book
in six years. Clearly it was not lack of public interest in <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> discoveries
that held <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer's</a> work back. Whatever the problem was, <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a> passed from view
and so did his journal; we have no clue as to its fate.</p>
            <p>
In April 1805, when <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> wrote that seven men were keeping journals, <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> was
already dead. If we accept <a class="regularization" title="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Pryor%2C%20Nathaniel%20Hale">Pryor</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Frazer, Robert" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Frazer%2C%20Robert">Frazer</a> as journal keepers, along with <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a>,
<a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">Ordway</a>, and <a class="regularization" title="Whitehouse, Joseph" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Whitehouse%2C%20Joseph">Whitehouse</a>, we still have two others to account for. It is possible that
<a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> counted <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a>, whose journal was sent back from <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Mandan%20%28N.%20Dak.%29">Fort Mandan</a>, even though
his record had ceased the previous August. There is a possibility that <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Private Alexander Willard</a> kept a journal, and with <a class="regularization" title="Willard, Alexander" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Willard%2C%20Alexander">Willard</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> we would have <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis's</a> seven journal keepers. <a href="#n07" id="ln07" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a> One way or another a considerable part of the record appears to be lost, perhaps forever.</p>
            <p>
The journals that remain belong with those of Lewis and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a>, supporting them
to the best of their ability as they did during the voyage. After the return <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a>
evaluated his men, each according to his individual merits, and then wrote of them
all: "the Ample support which they gave me under every difficulty; the manly firmness which they evinced on every necessary occasion; and the patience and fortitude
with which they submitted to, and bore, the fatigues and painful sufferings incident to my late tour to the <a class="regularization" title="Pacific Ocean" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, entitles them to my warmest approbation
and thanks." <a href="#n08" id="ln08" class="ref_link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

               <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Sergeant Patrick Gass</a>, it seems clear, was a tough, lively, enterprising man who did 
things his own way. He was of Irish ancestry, but the comic brogue those writers of 
fiction give him is probably the product of their imaginations. <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> was born in 1771 
in <a class="regularization" title="Pennsylvania" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Like <a class="regularization" title="Ordway, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Ordway%2C%20John">John Ordway</a> he was serving in <a class="regularization" title="Bissell, Russell" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bissell%2C%20Russell">Captain Russell Bissell's</a> company of the First Infantry, stationed at <a class="regularization" title="Kaskaskia, Ill." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Kaskaskia%2C%20Ill.">Kaskaskia</a>, <a class="regularization" title="Illinois" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Illinois">Illinois</a>, having joined the army in 
1799. Before then he had served on the frontier as a volunteer Ranger, a type of 
service requiring hardy and self-reliant men, and had become a competent carpenter, one of the most useful of frontier skills. Apparently he was one of those restless 
young Americans who moved about from one place to another and from one job to 
another, consciously looking for the right place and the right opportunity, unconsciously savoring the experiences life brought him. The Secretary of War instructed 
<a class="regularization" title="Bissell, Russell" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bissell%2C%20Russell">Captain Bissell</a> to furnish <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> with "one Sergeant &amp; Eight good men,"  
but <a class="regularization" title="Bissell, Russell" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Bissell%2C%20Russell">Bissell</a> evidently did not wish to lose a good carpenter, for he refused <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> 
request to be one of them. <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> was determined and sought out <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> and presented his case himself. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> says nothing of this in his Eastern Journal, but he must 
have been pleased with the Irishman's initiative. On a later occasion that initiative 
would please him less. <a href="#n09" id="ln09" class="ref_link"><sup>[9]</sup></a>

listed in <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark's</a> field journal. It can be assumed that his carpentry skills were useful 
in building the winter quarters at <a class="regularization" title="Dubois River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Dubois%20River">River Dubois</a>. Although he was in his thirties when

<a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> received the most votes. On August 26 <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Clark</a> noted, "apt. <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Pat Gass</a> a Sergt. Vice 
<a class="regularization" title="Floyd, Charles" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Floyd%2C%20Charles">Floyd</a> Deceased." In a Detachment Order the captains told the men:</p>
            <p class="blockquote "> The Commanding officers have every reason to hope from the previous faithfull services of <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Sergt.

may have been fellow Irishmen, and like <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> he had resided for a time in <a class="regularization" title="Wellsburg, W.

<a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">McKeehan</a>, who opened a book and stationery store in <a class="regularization" title="Pittsburgh, Pa." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Pittsburgh%2C%20Pa.">Pittsburgh</a> in 1807, persuaded <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass</a> to publish. Many publishers of those days were bookstore owners who 
raised the money for printing and binding by taking subscriptions for prospective

scientific qualifications were nil, and implied that the useful geographic information from the captain's journals would be found also in <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a>. <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Lewis</a> himself, noted 
<a class="regularization" title="McKeehan, David" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=McKeehan%2C%20David">McKeehan</a>, was not a trained scientist. The bookseller closed with some sarcasm

from the expedition which have often been reproduced in subsequent works. It was 
the first published work of any length dealing with the expedition, other than some 
spurious "instant books" based on their generally anonymous authors' imaginations and material lifted from earlier explorers' accounts. One reason for the repeated republication of <a class="regularization" title="Gass, Patrick" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Gass%2C%20Patrick">Gass's</a> work was undoubtedly the delay in the appearance of the official account by <a class="regularization" title="Biddle, Nicholas" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Biddle%2C%20Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</a>. <a href="#n18" id="ln18" class="ref_link"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
