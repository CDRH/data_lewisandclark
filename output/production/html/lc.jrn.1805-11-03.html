               <p>
Sunday Novemr. 3d    A foggy morning &amp; we delayed setting out till about 9 oClock A. M.    Several of our men went out a short distance for to hunt.—    The party that remained at Camp, shot this morning several Geese as they were flying over our Camp.    One of the Canoes that we saw at the large rapid stopped at the place we encamped, &amp; the Indians that were in her, &amp; several others of the same Nation that came by land staid with us all night.    The fog got so thick that we could not see 100 Yards distance from the Camp.    We find agreeable to the best calculation we can make that we are not more than 200 Miles from the Ocean.    One of the party that went out hunting this morning returned to the Camp and brought with him a large buck Deer which he had killed.    The remainder of the hunters also returned, &amp; had killed a number of Geese &amp; Ducks.    We then set out on our Voyage, the fog continuing so thick, that we could scarcely see the Shores or Islands as we passed along    We saw about 12 o'Clock A. M. several Islands &amp; halted to dine at the Mouth of a River, which came into the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> on the South side.    The mouths or entrance of this River is filled with a quick sand, which we run a pole 8 feet down, &amp; had no solid bottom and it emptied itself by several Mouths</p>
               <p>
At 2 o'Clock P. M. we passed also the Mouth of a small river, lying on the North side of the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>.    The weather now got clear &amp; pleasant.    We continued on, and saw a high round Mountain, lying on the South side 
of the River, which we supposed to be the same Mountain, that we saw above the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">great falls</a> of this River, and believe it to be the same Mountain; that <a class="regularization" title="Hood, Samuel" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Hood%2C%20Samuel">Lieutenant Hood</a> gave an account of when on a Voyage round the World with <a class="regularization" title="Cook, James" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Cook%2C%20James">Captain Cook</a>, This Mountain appeared nearly covered with Snow.    We proceeded on, the River being nearly One Mile &amp; a quarter wide in general, &amp; a number of large Islands in it, laying on both sides of it.—</p>
               <p>
Towards evening we met with several Indians, who were in a Canoe, &amp; who were going up the River.    The Indians made signs to us, that in 2 Sleeps, (meaning 2 days,) that we should come to a place, where we should see two Vessells, white people &amp;ca.    The country during this day, appears to lay lower than it had been for some time past, &amp; but few mountains to be seen.    The River had a handsomer appearance &amp; the Current of it very gentle.    We passed by some bottom land, lying along the River, which were cover'd with Cotton wood &amp; Pine Trees, and a number of Islands.    We encamped on a very large long Island by us called <a class="regularization" title="Government (Diamond, White Goose, Swan) Island" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Government%20%28Diamond%2C%20White%20Goose%2C%20Swan%29%20Island">Swan Island</a>, which was chiefly a Priari, and had a large lake in it, having gone about 13 Miles this day.    We saw in the River ever since we came through the <a class="regularization" title="Columbia River, Great Falls of the" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Columbia%20River%2C%20Great%20Falls%20of%20the">great falls</a>, a great many Sea Otters, Geese, Swans, brants, ducks &amp; other water fowl.—    Our party killed several Geese Swans &amp; Ducks 〈of them〉 this day.    A number of Indians came to the Island that we were encamped on, in Canoes, &amp; encamped with us.    Some of our party borrowed a small Canoe from those Indians, &amp; carried it out to the lake, where they killed a further quantity of Swans &amp; Geese.—
