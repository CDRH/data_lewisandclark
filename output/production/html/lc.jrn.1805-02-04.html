This morning fair tho' could    the thermometer stood at 18° below Naught, wind from N. W.    <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt Clark</a> set out with a hunting party consisting of sixteen of our command and two frenchmen <a href="#n09020401" id="ln09020401" class="ref_link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> who together with two others, have established a small hut and resided this winter within the vicinity of <a class="regularization" title="Fort Mandan (N.

Clark</a> therefore deturmined to continue his rout down the river even as far as the River bullet unless he should find a plenty of game nearer—    The men transported their baggage on a couple of small wooden Slays drawn by themselves, and took with them 3 pack horses which we had agreed should be returned with a load of meat to fort mandane as soon as they could procure it.    no buffaloe have made their appearance in our neighbourhood for some weeks [<span class="italic">NB: time (shorter)</span>]; and I am informed that our Indian neighbours—suffer extreemly at this moment for the article of <span class="italic">flesh</span>.    <a class="regularization" title="Shields, John" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Shields%2C%20John">Shields</a> killed two deer this evening, both very lean—    one a large buck, he had shed his horns.
