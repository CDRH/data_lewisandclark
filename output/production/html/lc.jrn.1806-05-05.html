However, examination of the journals indicates that virtually all of these sites were recorded in October 1805 and that few of the sites observed in May 1806 were recorded on this map. Apparently the <a class="regularization" title="Nez Perce Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Nez%20Perce%20Indians">Nez Perce</a> settlement pattern consisted of a dispersed population with numerous smaller lodges at fishing locations in the fall, then, in the late spring, the population would concentrate at fewer sites where larger communal mat lodges were constructed.
