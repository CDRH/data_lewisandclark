the [wind] blew very heard last night from N. and continued without intermission throughout the day    it became could about twelve oclock— the canoes were driven by the violence of the waves against the shore and filled with water    I therefore thought myself fortunate in having had them unladen on my arrival,—     measured the hight of the bank in the point and found it 36 F[eet] 8 I[nches] above the level of the water at thime [the time?] which may with much propriety be deemed <span class="italic">low water mark</span> as neither <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">the Ohio</a> or <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Missippi</a> wer ever known to be lower—</p>
               <p>	I yesterday measured the bank on the W. side of the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississipi</a> and found it 52 feet 8 Inches and the bank at this hight is sometimes overflown so that allowing the water to be on a level a dike in the point to be on a level with the opposite bank must be raised 16 feet and to render it completely safe a few feet higher—    the bank of the <a class="regularization" title="Mississippi River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> side is from two to 4 feet higher than the extreem point and is about the same number of 4 feet higher than the extreem point and is about the same number of feet higher than the bank of the <a class="regularization" title="Ohio River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Ohio%20River">Ohio</a>,—
