               <h4>Summary of Route and Major Biological Discoveries</h4>
               <p>Until the Corps of Discovery reached the vicinity of present-day <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span> (the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Kansas River</span>) in late June, they had
                  not entered true wilderness and had made only one zoological discovery of
                  interest—their capture on May 31, 1804, of several specimens of the eastern
                  woodrat (<span class="italic">Neotoma floridana</span>) in the woods near the mouth of
                  the <span class="tei_name">Osage River</span>, in <span class="tei_name">Osage</span> and <span class="tei_name">Calloway</span> Counties. It was almost another
                  month before they had pushed upstream far enough to reach the <span class="tei_name">Kansas River</span>, near which they saw
                  Carolina parakeets and encountered two villages of <span class="tei_name">Kansa</span> natives.</p>
               <p>They reached the present border of <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> on July 11, camping near the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Big Nemaha River</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> side and the <span class="tei_name">Tarkio River</span> on the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> side. By then they were traveling along the so-named <span class="tei_name">bald-pated hills</span>. These tall,
                  loess-formed hills of western Iowa were covered at their lower levels by hardwood
                  forests, but often were capped with native prairie. On July 12, a short distance
                  upstream from the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Big
                     Nemaha River</span>, they observed some low "artificial" mounds representing
                  the sites of old Native American burial grounds. On the morning of July 30 the
                  group arrived at a high bluff on the <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span> side that is now part of <span class="tei_name">Fort Calhoun</span>. There they camped for four days
                  and held a council with the assembled chiefs of the <span class="tei_name">Otoe</span>-<span class="tei_name">Missouria</span> tribe. This council was the first held between the natives of
                  the central <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley and the
                  U.S. government, and the bluff was thus named <span class="tei_name">Council Bluff</span>. It later became the site of
                     <span class="tei_name">Camp Missouri</span>, the first
                  military post in <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, subsequently
                  renamed <span class="tei_name">Fort Calhoun</span>.</p>
               <p>On August 13 the group passed <span class="tei_name">Omaha
                     Creek</span> and camped at an old <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> village that night. On August 16 they seined
                  more than 1,000 fish of at least ten species at this "fishing camp," none of which
                  Elliott Coues could identify with certainty on the basis of the names that the men
                  used. Fish caught in the <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>-<span class="tei_name">Iowa</span> region and farther up the <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> did include some
                  remarkably large catfish (see the <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>
                  chapter in this book). They remained in the <span class="tei_name">Omaha</span> vicinity until August 19, and then began north again. On August
                  20, 1804, <span class="tei_name">Sergeant Floyd</span> died of a
                  probable burst appendix and was buried on a high bluff just south of present-day
                     <span class="tei_name">Sioux City</span>, <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span>. The next day the group passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Big Sioux
                     River</span>, camping in what is now <span class="tei_name">Dakota County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, with the <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> boundary on the opposite shore. The following day (August
                  22) they passed <span class="tei_name">Ionia Creek</span> and camped
                  in what is now <span class="tei_name">Union County</span>,
                     <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. By September 7 they
                  had passed out of what is now the shoreline of <span class="tei_name">Boyd County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, and were then entirely within the present boundaries of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>.</p>
               <p>The return trip was relatively rapid, the party arriving in what is now northern
                     <span class="tei_name">Boyd County</span>, <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, on August 29, 1806. They passed
                  the mouths of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara</span>, <span class="tei_name">James</span>, and <span class="tei_name">Vermillion</span> Rivers on
                  September 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On September 8 they passed <span class="tei_name">Council Bluff</span>, and the next day the mouth of
                  the <span class="tei_name">Platte River</span>. They passed
                  the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Big Nemaha River</span>
                  and entered present-day <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span> on September
                  11. On September 15 they passed the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Kansas River</span> and reentered <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>. They reached the confluence of the
                     <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> and <span class="tei_name">Mississippi</span> Rivers on September 23, 1806, and
                  were finally home.</p>

                           Bluffs</span> a badger was killed on July 20, 1804. Another was brought
                        into <span class="tei_name">Fort Mandan</span> by
                        one of the party on January 18, 1805. The species was called a "brarow" by
                        the expedition members. The <span class="tei_name">Oglala branch of the Lakotas</span> regarded
                        the badger as having great strength and tenacity, and its symbolic powers
                        extended to the healing of sick children.</p>

                     <strong>Beaver <span class="italic">Castor canadensis</span>
                     </strong>
                     <p>Beavers were first encountered on the outward journey near present-day <span class="tei_name">Leavenworth</span>, <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span>. They were seen again near <span class="tei_name">Council Bluffs</span>, <span class="tei_name">Iowa</span>, and after that were regularly
                        encountered, being trapped at nearly every stopping point. In <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> alone they were reported from
                        at least 33 locations. In his summary of the natural history of the
                        expedition, Raymond Burroughs calculated that at least 113 beaver were
                        killed over the entire expedition period. Three decades after the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition, Maximilian,
                        Prince of Wied, reported that in a single year 25,000 beaver pelts were
                        brought into <span class="tei_name">Fort
                        Union</span>. Beavers were already becoming rare only a decade later, when
                        John J. Audubon visited the same fort. At the time of the <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> expedition, North
                        American beavers were highly valuable as pelts and were classified as the
                        same species as the Old World beaver, but in 1820 they were recognized as
                        separate types. After great overharvesting and near disappearance, the North
                        American beaver has now recovered its former range and may be more common
                        than at any time in the past century.</p>

                     <p>Bison were not encountered by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                        until they had nearly reached the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Kansas River</span>. A large herd of
                        about 500 animals was observed on September 9 above the mouth of the <span class="tei_name">Niobrara
                        River</span>, but none was killed until August 23, when they had they had
                        reached the vicinity of present-day <span class="tei_name">Vermillion</span>, <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span>. Burroughs calculated that at
                        least 227 bison were killed during the expedition. The last known wild
                        bison, in what is now <span class="tei_name">North
                           Dakota</span>, was killed in 1888, a year after the last one in <span class="tei_name">Montana</span> was killed and about three
                        years after the last <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>

                     <p>Although several black bears were seen in <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span>, none was reported again in journal records until the
                        party arrived in what is now <span class="tei_name">North
                           Dakota</span>, when a female and her cubs were seen near the mouth of the
                           <span class="tei_name">Little
                           Missouri</span>. In a letter to his mother, <span class="tei_name">Captain Lewis</span> mentioned seeing black bears
                        in the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley
                        between <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span> and the mouth of the
                           <span class="tei_name">Big
                           Sioux River</span>. Farther west, no black bears were seen by <span class="tei_name">Lewis</span> and <span class="tei_name">Clark</span> between the mouth of the
                           <span class="tei_name">Little Missouri
                           River</span> and the <span class="tei_name">Bitterroot Mountains</span> of <span class="tei_name">Montana</span>, although grizzly bears were very common over this entire
                        route. Burroughs calculated that at least 23 black bears were killed during
                        the expedition. Black bears are now completely gone from <span class="tei_name">Kansas</span>. They are also probably gone from the <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley of <span class="tei_name">South Dakota</span> (a 1968 <span class="tei_name">Black Hills</span> sighting is the most
                        recent) and from <span class="tei_name">North Dakota</span>
                        (there are some early-twentieth-century records of sightings in the <span class="tei_name">Turtle Mountains</span>).
                        In 2000 a black bear wandered into northwestern <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>, perhaps from <span class="tei_name">Wyoming</span>, producing the first state record since
                        1907. Since then a few more bears have reported in western <span class="tei_name">Nebraska</span>.</p>

                        more were killed. Burroughs calculated that at least 375 elk were killed
                        during the expedition. On the return trip the last one was obtained near the

                        thought might have been this species. Since the red-tailed hawk is by far
                        the most common breeding hawk of the central <span class="tei_name">Missouri</span> Valley, and is a permanent resident

                        Swenk tentatively identified this species as the lark bunting (<span class="italic">Calamospiza melanocorys</span>). However, by August the lark
                        bunting's breeding season is over, and males would be molting out of their
                        nearly all-black breeding plumage and into a brown plumage. Other more
                        common and permanently black-plumaged birds in that region are better
                        possibilities, including various blackbirds and grackles. Gary Moulton has
                        suggested that <span class="tei_name">Clark</span>
                        observed the red-winged blackbird, which seems a much more likely choice, as
                        by late August these abundant birds would be forming migratory flocks. One
                        of the most numerous of North American songbirds, this species may number in
                        excess of 100 million birds. However, although it probably increased greatly
                        during the first half of the twentieth century, its overall population has
                        been declining significantly over the past four decades as breeding habitats
                        have been increasingly converted to agriculture.</p>

                        prairie-chickens or sharp-tailed grouse, given the wooded habitat along the
                        river. Early records suggest that ruffed grouse once occurred along <span class="tei_name">Nebraska's</span>

                        most probably were wood ducks, which would have been common along the wooded
                           <span class="tei_name">Missouri River</span> shorelines
                        in late summer. Wood ducks were also reportedly seen in the vicinity of

                     <p>A widespread perennial shrub whose edible fruits were cooked or eaten raw by
                        Native Americans. The fruits were used in feasts celebrating a girl's
                        arrival at puberty, and the plant's English vernacular name relates to the
                        fact that the berries were once used to flavor bison meat. Collected

                        It produces fairly large acorns, a valuable food for many wildlife species
                        as well as humans, who often boiled the acorns to rid them of bitter tannic
                        acid. The abundant tannin in oak bark, acorns, and galls was almost
                        certainly used by Native Americans for tanning leather. Collected September

                        Its use was generally limited to medicine men, and its root was regarded as
