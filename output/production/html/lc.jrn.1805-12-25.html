Wednesday 25th Decr. 1805.    rainy &amp; wet.    disagreeable weather.    we all moved in to our new Fort, which our officers name <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clotsop</a> after the name of the <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clotsop</a> nation of Indians who live nearest to us.    the party Saluted our officers by each man firing a gun at their quarters at day break this morning.    they divided out the last of their tobacco among the men that used and the rest they gave each a Silk hankerchief, as a Christmast gift, to keep us in remembrence of it as we have no ardent Spirits, but are all in good health which we esteem more than all the ardent Spirits in the world.    we have nothing to eat but poore Elk meat and no Salt to Season that with but Still keep in good Spirits as we expect this to be the last winter that we will have to pass in this way.—

                  <em class="hi">Wednesday 25th.</em>    Was another cloudy wet day.— This morning we left our 
camp and moved into our huts. At daybreak all the men paraded and fired a round of small arms, wishing the Commanding Officers a merry Christmas. In the course of the day <a class="regularization" title="Lewis, Meriwether" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Lewis%2C%20Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</a> and  <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Capt. Clarke</a> collected what tobacco remained, and divided it amongst those who used tobacco, as Christmas-gift; to the others they gave handkerchiefs in lieu of it. We had no spirituous liquors to elevate our spirits this Christmas; but of this we had but little need, as we were all in very good health. Our living is not very good; meat is in plenty, but of an ordinary quality, as the elk are poor in this part of the country. We have no kind of provisions but meat, and we are without salt to season that.</p>
               <p>
The 26th, 27th and 28th, were cloudy with rain. We found our huts smoked; there being no chimneys in them except in the officers' rooms. The men were therefore employed, except some hunters who went out, in making chimnies to the huts. In the evening of the 27th we were informed that a large fish, answering to the description of a whale, was driven upon shore. In the forenoon of the 28th six men <a href="#n26122503" id="ln26122503" class="ref_link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> started for the sea shore to make salt, as we have none in the fort. Two hunters returned, having killed a deer, and three went out to hunt. <a href="#n26122504" id="ln26122504" class="ref_link"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

Wednesday Decemr. 25th    We had hard rain &amp; Cloudy weather as usual.    We all moved into our new Garrison or Fort, which our Officers named after a nation of Indians who resided near us, called the <a class="regularization" title="Clatsop Indians" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians">Clatsop</a> Nation; <a class="regularization" title="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Fort%20Clatsop%20%28Oreg.%29">Fort Clatsop</a>.—    We found our huts comfortable, excepting smoaking a little.—</p>
               <p>
We saluted our officers, by each of our party firing off his gun at day break in honor to the day (Christmass[)]    Our Officers in return, presented to each of the party that used Tobacco a part of what Tobacco they had remaining; and to those who did not make use of it, they gave a handerchief or some other article, in remembrance of Christmass.    We had no ardent spirit of any kind among us; but are mostly in good health, A blessing, which we esteem more, than all the luxuries this life can afford, and the party are all thankful to the Supreme Being, for his goodness towards us.—    hoping he will preserve us in the same, &amp; enable us to return to the United States again in safety.    We have at present nothing to eat but lean Elk meat &amp; that without Salt, but the whole of our party are content with this fare.—
