The nativs of this neighbourhood eate the root of the Cattail or Cooper's flag.    it is pleasantly tasted and appears to be very nutrecious.    the inner part of the root which is eaten without any previous preperation is Composed of a number of capellary white flexable Strong fibers among which is a mealy or Starch like Substance which readily disolves in the mouth and Seperates from the fibers which are then rejected.    it appears to me that this Substance would make excellent Starch; nothing Can be of a pureer white than it is.—.</p>
