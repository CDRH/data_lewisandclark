Set out early this morning, or before sunrise; still continued our march through the level valley on the lard. side of the river.    the valley much as yesterday only reather wider; I think it 12 Miles wide, tho' the plains near the mountains rise higher and are more broken with some scattering pine near the mountain.    in the leaveler parts of the plain and river bottoms which are very extensive there is no timber except a scant proportion of cottonwood near the river.    the under wood consists of the narrow leafed or small willow, the small honeysuckle, rosebushes, currant, serviceberry, and goosbery bushes; also a small species of berch in but small quantities 〈of a species〉 the leaf which is oval finely, indented, small and of a deep green colour. <a href="#n18080305" id="ln18080305" class="ref_link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>    the stem is simple ascending and branching, and seldom rises higher than 10 or 12 feet.    the Mountains continue high on either side of the valley, and are but scantily supplyed with timber; small pine apears to be the prevalent growth; it is of the pich kind, with a short leaf.    at 11 A. M. <a class="regularization" title="Drouillard, George" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Drouillard%2C%20George">Drewyer</a> killed a doe and we halted about 2 hours and breakfasted, and then continued our rout untill night without halting, when we arrived at the river in a level bottom which appeared to spread to greater extent than usual.    from the appearance of the timber I supposed that the river forked above us and resolved to examine this part of the river minutely tomorrow.    this evening we passed through a high plain for about 8 miles covered with prickley pears and bearded grass, tho' we found this even better walking than the wide bottoms of the river, which we passed in the evening; these altho' apparently level, from some cause which I know not, were formed into meriads of deep holes as if rooted up by hogs    these the grass covered so thick that it was impossible to walk without the risk of falling down at every step. some parts of these bottoms also possess excellent terf or peat, I beleive of many feet deep.    the mineral salts also frequently mentioned on the <a class="regularization" title="Missouri River" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?places=Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> we saw this evening in these uneven bottoms. <a href="#n18080306" id="ln18080306" class="ref_link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>    we saw many deer, Antelopes ducks, gees, some beaver and great appearance of their work. also a small bird and the Curlooe as usual. <a href="#n18080307" id="ln18080307" class="ref_link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>    we encamped on the river bank on Lard. side having traveled by estimate 23 Miles.

Saturday August 3rd    A Clear morning, &amp; we set out on our Voyage early, <a class="regularization" title="Clark, William" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../search?people=Clark%2C%20William">Captain Clark</a> walked on Shore a short time, and killed a Deer.—    We halted our Canoes, and took the Deer on board, and then proceeded on, We find the River very crooked, and filled with Islands.    We continued on, and saw 2 Deer a small distance a head of us.—    One of our hunters went out after them, this hunter killed a Panther on a small Island, a small distance from us.    it differed but very little from those seen in the United States.    It measured 7½ feet long, and was of a reddish colout, its tushes was very long, the Talons thick but not long, We passed many places in the River, that the water ran so rapid, that we were forced to double man the Tow ropes to drag the Canoes over the Shoals &amp; rapids.    We passed a large Priari lying on the South side of the River, high Grass &amp; bushes, growing along the River.    We also passed a very large spring, which lies on the South side of the River, and comes from under the mountains.—    The beaver had dammed up the Mouth of this large spring, and had built their houses all through the pond it had formed, it falls over the beaver dam into the River, about 4 feet, We passed over a bad rapid, and halted about One o'Clock P. M. to dine at a bottom of timber'd land, on the south side of the River—    The day was warm but pleasant, we proceeded on and passed several springs, one of which was very large, lying on the south side of the river, &amp; some plains, some of which was covered with Cotton wood Trees &amp; birch timber.—    The River has this day run more rapid, &amp; the Rapids much longer, than any we had yet 
seen, which fataigued our Men exceedingly.—    We came 11½ Miles this day &amp; encamped 〈in〉 on the South side of the River, in a place of Wood land.—
