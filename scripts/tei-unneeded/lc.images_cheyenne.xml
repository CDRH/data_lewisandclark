Like some other Native peoples of the Plains, the Cheyennes abandoned farming as a way of life when they moved from the Great Lakes region to the Plains. By the time of the Corps of Discovery, the Cheyennes were mobile horse riders and noted fighters, allied with the Arapahos and living in the region around the headwaters of the Platte River in Wyoming and western Nebraska. Their lives, like the Arapahos, centered on the buffalo. Even decades later, as seen in this picture, the Cheyennes preferred to hunt buffalo and live in portable tepee lodges. As with the Arapahos, the Cheyennes split into northern and southern divisions in the decades immediately following the Corps of Discovery. The Northern Cheyenne, after fighting victoriously with the Lakotas against Custer at the Little Bighorn in 1876, were placed on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, while the Southern Cheyenne were eventually resettled on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation in western Oklahoma. Today both divisions of the Cheyennes are creatively developing economic solutions to decades-old impoverishment on their reservations and taking steps to ensure the vitality of their language and culture.
