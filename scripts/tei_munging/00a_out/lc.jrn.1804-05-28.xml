Monday 28th May 1804.    a pleasant morning.    Several men out a hunting.    the Latidude at this place is 38° 44' 3 5–10th    as I was a hunting this day I came across a cave on the South Side or fork of a river about 100 yards from the River.    I went a 100 yards under ground.    had no light in my hand if I had, I Should have gone further    their was a Small Spring in it.    it is the most remarkable cave I ever Saw, in my travels.    I returnd to the River    found the boad had gone on and had left the french perogue for me.    I called    they came across for me, and went to camp    took din[ner] and procd. on    the barge had been gone abt. 2 hours.    we went about 2 miles and Camped for the night.</p>
               <p>
Monday May 28th    This morning being fair I went out hunting with several of our Men, for the day; and on my route I discover'd a Cave on the south side or fork of a small River, about 100 Yards from said fork.    I entered the Cave and proceeded about 100 Yards under the ground, and found from light which came from the 〈top〉 Mouth of the Cave a small 
spring in it.    I think it one of the most remarkable Caves I ever saw in my travels.    I should have proceeded further into the Cave, but it being dark towards the further end, and having no light, I was forced to return.—    On 
my arriving at the River I found that Captains <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had proceeded on with the Boat, and had left a pettiauger and some hands waiting for me.    On my hailing them, they came across for me.    We then proceeded to camp, and took dinner, after which we proceeded on with the Pettiauger, the Barge having been gone about two hours, we followed on about two hours; and encamped for that night.
