                  <hi rend="italic">Sunday 6th.</hi>    We had a fine clear morning with some white frost, and renewed our journey early; saw a great many serviceberries, not yet ripe, and some flax which grows on these plains. Having gone about seven miles we passed a <name type="place" key="North Fork Blackfoot (Cohahlarishkit) River">north branch of the Co-qual-la-isquet</name>,<ref target="n37070634" n="34"/> which is 40 yards wide and was mid-rib deep to our horses, with a rapid current. About seven miles up the valley we passed a beautiful small lake;<ref target="n37070635" n="35"/> where the river and road leave the valley, and bears towards the northeast between two hills not very large. We kept up the river, through a small brushy valley about the eighth of a mile wide, for a mile and half, and then halted for dinner. Here our two hunters came to us, and had killed a deer. We kept two men out every day hunting. In this small valley there is a considerable quantity of cotton wood timber; and the musketoes are very troublesome. At 1 o'clock we proceeded on, passed a number of handsome streams which fall into the river, and a number of old Indian lodges. As we advance the valley becomes more extensive, and is all plain. At night we encamped<ref target="n37070636" n="36"/> on a beautiful creek, having travelled twenty five miles. Our hunters killed four deer to day.
