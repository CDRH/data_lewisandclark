Tuesday Novemr. 26th    A cloudy wet morning, &amp; we set out early.    we proceeded about 1 Mile up the River &amp; then crossed it.    In doing of which we passed through several Islands.    We proceeded on down the South side of the River, &amp; came to an Inhabited Village of Indians.<ref target="n26112612" n="12"/>    We halted at this place for a short time; where the Indians gave us plenty to eat consisting of Roots not unlike potatoes &amp; behaved friendly to us.—    They also gave us a few of these Roots or wild potatoes to take with us.    We continued on still down the River; the day being wet, cold and very disagreeable.    We encamped<ref target="n26112613" n="13"/> in a thicket on the South shore.    Several Indians came to us in a Canoe, with Roots to sell.    We saw along the shore, a number of Islands that lay very low &amp; marshy.    The Geese, swan &amp; Ducks are in the greatest plenty at this place, &amp; our Hunters killed a number of them.    We purchased the Roots the Indians had brought with them in the Canoe, and they left us well pleased.—
