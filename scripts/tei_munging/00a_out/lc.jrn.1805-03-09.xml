He had a formidable, and largely bad, reputation.

He was less than cordial to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> but was far more favorable toward the British traders, being particularly helpful to <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Fran<seg n="u231">ç</seg>ois-Antoine Larocque</name>, when the rest of the tribe opposed the trader's proposed trip to the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> in 1805.

The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> finally threw him out of power in 1813, after which he withdrew and established a separate village of only a few lodges.
