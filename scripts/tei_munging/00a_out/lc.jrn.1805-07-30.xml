                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> being much better this morning and having completed my observations we reloaded our canoes and set out, ascending <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jeffersons river</name>.    <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name>, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">his woman</name> two invalleds and myself walked through the bottom of the Lard. side of the river about 4½ miles when we again struck it at the place <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">the woman</name> informed us that she was taken prisoner.<ref target="n18073001" n="1"/> here we halted untill <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> arrived which was not untill after one P.M. the water being strong and the river extreemly crooked.    we dined and again proceeded on; as the river now passed through the woods the invalleds got on board together with <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name> and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">the Indian woman</name>; I passed the river and continued my walk on the Stard. side.    saw a vast number of beaver in many large dams which they had maid in various bayoes of the river which are distributed to the distance of three or four miles on this side of the river over an extensive bottom of timbered and meadow lands intermixed.    in order to avoid these bayoes and beaver dams which I found difficult to pass I directed my course to the high plain to the right which I gained after some time with much difficulty and waiding many beaver dams to my waist in mud and water.    I would willingly have joined the canoes but the brush were so thick, the river crooked and bottoms intercepted in such manner by the beaver dams, that I found it uceless to attempt to find them, and therefore proceeded on up the river in order to intersept it where it came near the plain and woult be more collected into one channel.    at length about sunset I arrived at the river only about six miles from my calculation on a direct line from the place I had left the canoes but I thought they were still below me. I found the river was divided where I reached it by an Island and was therefore fearfull that they might pass without my seeing them, and went down to the lower point of the large island; here I discovered a small Island, close under the shore on which I was; I passed the narrow channel to the small island and examined the gravly bar along the edge of the river for the tracks of the men, knowing from the appearance of the river at this place that if they had passed they would have used the cord on the side where I was. I saw no tracks and was then fully convinced that they were below me. I fired my gun and hallooed but counld hear nothing of them.    by this time it was getting nearly dark and a duck lit on the shore in about 40 steps of me and I killed it; having now secured my supper I looked our for a suitable place to amuse myself in combating the musquetoes for the ballance of the evening. I found a parsel of drift wood at the head of the little Island on which I was and immediately set it on fire and collected some willow brush to lye on. I cooked my duck which I found very good and after eating it layed down and should have had a comfortable nights lodge but for the musquetoes which infested me all night.    late at night I was awakened by the nois of some animal runing over the stoney bar on which I lay but did not see it; from the weight with which it ran I supposed it to be either an Elk or a brown bear.<ref target="n18073002" n="2"/>    the latter are very abundant in this neighbourhood.    the night was cool but I felt very little inconvenience from it as I had a large fire all night. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had proceeded on after I seperated from him and encamped on a islad. only about 2 miles below me<ref target="n18073003" n="3"/> but did not hear the report of my gun nor of my hooping.—I saw some deer and antelopes.<ref target="n18073004" n="4"/>
