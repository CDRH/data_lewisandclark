a frost this morning. The Inds. Cought out of their traps Several Sammon and gave us two, I purchased two others which we made last us to day. Several a Camp of about 40 Indians came from the West fork and passed up to day, nothing killed by my party with every exertion in all places where game probably might be found. I dispatched one man<ref target="n22082801" n="1"/> to the upper camps to enquire if <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Cap. Lewis</name> was comeing &amp;c.    he returned after night with a letter from <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> informing me of his Situation at the upper Village, and had precured 22 horses for our rout through by land on the plan which I had preposed in which he agreed with me in; and requsted me to ride up and get the horses the Indian informed him they had reserved for me &amp;c. I purchased Some fish roe of those pore but kind people with whome I am Encamped for which I gave three Small fish hooks, the use of which they readily proseved, one Indian out all day &amp; killed only one Sammon with his gig; my hunters killed nothing, I had three pack Saddles made to day for our horses which I expected <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt Lewis</name> would purchase &amp;c. Those Sammon which I live on at present are pleasent eateing, not with standing they weaken me verry fast and my flesh I find is declineing</p>
