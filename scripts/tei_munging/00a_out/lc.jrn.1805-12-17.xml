Some rain last night and a continuation of it this morning.    all the men at work about the houses, Some Chiking, Dobbing Cutting out dores &amp;c. &amp;c. The 7 men left to bring in the Elk arrived and informed that they Could not find the meat that the party who Stayed out all night had left—    the forepart of this day rained hailed and blew hard, the after part is fair and Cool—    a Mountain which is S. [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>]° E. about 10 mile distant has got Snow on its top which is ruged and uneavin</p>
               <p>
Cause a Small fire &amp; Smoke to be made under the meat which is hung up in Small peaces:    The trees which our men have fallen latterly Split verry badly into boards.    The most of our Stores are wet.    our Leather Lodge has become So rotten that the Smallest thing tares it into holes and it is now Scrcely Sufficent to keep off the rain off a Spot Sufficiently large for our bead.
