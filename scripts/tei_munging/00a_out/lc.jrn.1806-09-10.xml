               <name type="person" key="Pike, Zebulon Montgomery">Zebulon Montgomery Pike</name>, a young army officer, had carried out an expedition to the upper <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> in 1805.

Historians now believe that <name type="person" key="Wilkinson, James">General Wilkinson</name> did indeed have some ulterior purpose, which <name type="person" key="Pike, Zebulon Montgomery">Pike</name> may or may not have been aware of, but no solid proof has come to light.

Some people accused <name type="person" key="Pike, Zebulon Montgomery">Pike</name> of involvement in <name type="person" key="Burr, Aaron">Aaron Burr's</name> conspiracies but he was able to continue his army career.
