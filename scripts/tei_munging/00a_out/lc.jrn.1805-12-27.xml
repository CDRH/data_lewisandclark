Friday Decmr. 27th    It continued raining hard during the whole of this day.    We were all employed in building Chimneys in our huts, which we compleated, &amp; found our huts comfortable &amp; without smoak.    In the Evening some Indians<ref target="n25122704" n="4"/> came to our Fort, they informed us by signs, that a large Fish was drove by the Wind &amp; waves on the shore near to where their lodges were, &amp; we all suppose from the description they gave of it, that it must be a Whale.—
