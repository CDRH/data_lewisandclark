On the bank opposite our camp is an ancient fortification or breastwork,<ref target="n06090209" n="9"/> similar to those which have been occasionally discovered on the western waters.

"Glassee"—    a glacis is a natural or artificial slope in front of a fortification, on which the attackers would be exposed to fire from the defenders.</p>

"gouge"—    a gorge is the entrance into some outlying work.</p>
