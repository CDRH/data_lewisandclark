Some of the men went out to hunt and some to mend the canoe which had been split in the storm yesterday. The natives still stay with us, and have a few roots and berries to subsist on at present; but I cannot conjecture how they live during the winter. They have no mockasons or leggins of any kind; and scarce any other covering than the small robes, which were mentioned before.</p>
               <p>
In the afternoon, 10 of the <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clat-sop</name> nation<ref target="n26112306" n="6"/> that live on the south side of the river, came over to our camp. These are also naked, except the small robes which hardly cover their shoulders. One of these men had the reddest hair I ever saw, and a fair skin, much freckled.<ref target="n26112307" n="7"/> In the evening our hunters came in, and had killed 3 deer, 8 brants, and 12 ducks.— In the evening the weather cleared and we had a fine night.
