A delightful morning, set out at an erly hour.    the country though which we passed to day was much the same as that discribed of yesterday; there wase more appearance of birnt hills, furnishing large quanties of lava and pumice stone,<ref target="n11041701" n="1"/> of the latter some pieces were seen floating down the river. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked on shore this morning on the Stard. side, and did not join us untill 〈near sunset〉 half after six in evening.    he informed me that he had seen the remains of the <name type="native_nation" key="Assiniboine Indians">Assinniboin</name> encampments in every point of woodland through which he had passed.    we saw immence quantities of game in every direction around us as we passed up the river; consisting of herds of Buffaloe, Elk, and Antelopes with some deer and woolves.    tho' we continue to see many tracks of the bear we have seen but very few of them, and those are at a great distance generally runing from us; I thefore presume that they are extreemly ware and shy; the Indian account of them dose not corrispond with our experience so far.    one black bear passed near the perogues on the 16th and was seen by myself and the party but he so quickly disappeared that we did not shoot at him.—    at the place we halted to dine on the Lard. side we met with a herd of buffaloe of which I killed the fatest as I concieved among them, however on examining it I found it so poar that I thought it unfit for uce and only took the tongue; the party killed another which was still more lean.    just before we encamped this evening we saw some tracks of Indians who had passed about 24 hours; they left four rafts of tim[ber] on the Stard. side, on which they had passed.    we supposed them to have been a party of the <name type="native_nation" key="Assiniboine Indians">Assinniboins</name> who had been to war against the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountain</name> Indians, and then on their return.    <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> saw a Curlou today.<ref target="n11041702" n="2"/>    there were three beaver taken this morning by the party. the men prefer the flesh of this anamal, to that of any other which we have, or are able to procure at this moment. I eat very heartily of the beaver myself, and think it excellent; particularly the tale, and liver.    we had a fair wind today which enabled us to sail the greater part of the distance we have travled, encamped on the Lard shore the extremity of the last course<ref target="n11041703" n="3"/>
