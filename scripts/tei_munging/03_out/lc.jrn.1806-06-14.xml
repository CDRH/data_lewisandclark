Sent our hunters out early this morning. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> killed a deer and brought it in by 10 A. M.    the other hunters <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> returned early without having killed anything. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> returned.    we had all our articles packed up and made ready for an early departure in the morning.    our horses were caught and most of them hubbled and otherwise confined in order that we might not be detained.    from hence to <name type="place" key="Travelers' Rest (Idaho)">traveller's rest</name>
                  <ref target="n36061401" n="1"/> we shall make a forsed march; at that place we shal probably remain one or two days to rest ourselves and horses and procure some meat.    we have now been detained near five weeks in consequence of the snows; a serious loss of time at this delightfull season for traveling. I am still apprehensive that the snow and the want of food for our horses will prove a serious imbarrassment to us as at least four days journey of our rout in these mountains lies over hights and along a ledge of mountains never intirely destitute of snow.    every body seems anxious to be in motion, convinced that we have not now any time to delay if the calculation is to reach the United States this season; this I am detirmined to accomplish if within the compass of human power.
