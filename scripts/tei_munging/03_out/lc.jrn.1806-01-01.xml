This morning I was awoke at an early hour by the discharge of a volley    of small arms, which were fired by our party in front of our quarters to usher in the new year; this was the only mark of rispect which we had it in our power to pay this celebrated day.    our repast of this day tho' better than that of Christmass, consisted principally in the anticipation of the 1st day of January 1807, when in the bosom of our friends we hope to participate in the mirth and hilarity of the day, and when the zest given by the recollection of the present, we shall completely, both mentally and corporally, enjoy the repast which the hand of civilization has prepared for us.    at present we were content with eating our boiled Elk and wappetoe, and solacing our thirst with our only beverage <hi rend="italic">pure water.</hi> two of our hunters who set out this morning reterned in the evening having killed two bucks elk;    they presented <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and myself each a marrow-bone and tonge, 〈each〉 on which we suped.    visited today by a few of the <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clotsops</name> who brought some roots and burries for the purpose of trading with us.    we were uneasy with rispect to two of our men, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Wiser</name>, who were dispatched on the 28th ulto. with the saltmakers, and were directed to return immediately; their not having returned induces us to believe it probable that they have missed their way.—    our fourtification being now completed we issued an order for the more exact and uniform dicipline and government of the garrison. (see orderly book 1st January 1806).—

The fort being now completed, the Commanding officers think proper to direct: that the guard shall as usual consist of one Sergeant and three privates, and that the same be regularly relieved each morning at sunrise.    The post of the new guard shall be in the room of the Sergeants rispectivly commanding the same.    the centinel shall be posted, both day and night, on the parade in front of the commanding offercers quarters; tho' should he at any time think proper to remove himself to any other part of the fort, in order the better to inform himself of the desighns or approach of any party of savages, he is not only at liberty, but is hereby required to do so.    It shall be the duty of the centinel also to announce the arrival of all parties of Indians to the Sergeant of the Guard, who shall immediately report the same to the Commanding officers.</p>
               <p>
The Commanding Officers require and charge the Garrison to treat the natives in a friendly manner; nor will they be permitted at any time, to abuse, assault or strike them; unless such abuse assault or stroke be first given by the natives.    nevertheless it shall be right for any individual, in a peaceable manner, to refuse admittance to, or put out of his room, any native who may become troublesome to him; and should such native refuse to go when requested, or attempt to enter their rooms after being forbidden to do so; it shall be the duty of the Sergeant of the guard on information of the same, to put such native out of the fort and see that he is not again admitted during that day unless specially permitted; and the Sergeant of the guard may for this purpose imploy such coercive measures (not extending to the taking of life) as shall at his discretion be deemed necessary to effect the same.</p>
               <p>
When any native shall be detected in theft, the Sergt. of the guard shall immediately inform the Commanding offercers of the same, to the end that such measures may be pursued with rispect to the culprit as they shall think most expedient.</p>
               <p>
At sunset on each day, the Sergt. attended by the interpreter <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> and two of his guard, will collect and put out of the fort, all Indians except such as may specially be permitted to remain by the Commanding offercers, nor shall they be again admitted untill the main gate be opened the ensuing morning.</p>
               <p>
At Sunset, or immediately after the Indians have been dismissed, both gates shall be shut, and secured, and the main gate locked and continue so untill sunrise the next morning: the water-gate may be used freely by the Garrison for the purpose of passing and repassing at all times, tho' from sunset, untill sunrise, it shall be the duty of the centinel, to open the gate for, and shut it after all persons passing and repassing, suffering the same never to remain unfixed long than is absolutely necessary.</p>
               <p>
It shall be the duty of the Sergt. of the guard to keep the kee of the Meat house, and to cause the guard to keep regular fires therein when the same may be necessary; and also once at least in 24 hours to visit the canoes and see that they are safely secured; and shall further on each morning after he is relieved, make his report verbally to the Commandg officers.—</p>
               <p>
Each of the old guard will every morning after being relieved furnish two loads of wood 〈each〉 for the commanding offercers fire.</p>
               <p>
No man is to be particularly exempt from the duty of bringing meat from the woods, nor none except the Cooks and Interpreters from that of mounting guard.</p>
               <p>
Each mess being furnished with an ax, they are directed to deposit in the room of the commanding offercers all other public tools of which they are possessed; nor 〈are〉 shall the same at any time hereafter be taken from the said deposit without the knowledge and permission of the commanding officers; and any individual so borrowing the tools are strictly required to bring the same back the moment he has ceased to use them, and no case shall they be permited to keep them out all night.</p>
               <p>
Any individual selling or disposing of any tool or iron or steel instrument, arms, accoutrements or ammunicion, shall be deemed guilty of a breach of this order, and shall be tryed and punished accordingly.— the tools loaned to <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> are excepted from the restrictions of this order.</p>

Wednesday 1st Jany. 1806—    The party Saluted our officers at day break this morning by firing at their quarters as a remembrence of the new year    a pleasant morning.    2 men went out a hunting. Several of the natives<ref target="n26010119" n="19"/> visited us.    they go bare leged all winter and bare footed    Some kind of a little Robe over their Shoulders &amp;C.    the women have Short peticoats made of Some kind of grass Some of which are twisted like twine, and are nearly naked otherways    the general part of them are verry poor and ask a large price for any thing they have to part with.    in the evening the two hunters returned &amp; had killed two large buck Elk.—

Wednesday January 1st    At day break, the Men at the fort fired several Guns, as a salute to our Commanding officers; &amp; in honor of the day.    The Morning was pleasant.    Two of our party were sent out to hunt.    Several Indians<ref target="n26010122" n="22"/> came to the fort on a visit.    They were entirely naked, excepting a breech Cloth which they wore &amp; Skins thrown over their Shoulders.    This is the manner which the Natives in general go cloathed.    The Winters here are not very Cold, &amp; the ground has not as yet been cover'd with Snow this Winter.    In the afternoon the hunters returned to the Fort, they had killed 2 large Buck Elks 〈bucks〉

            <note xml:id="n26010108" n="8">This list of trading captains and their ships in the Elkskin-bound Journal appears between the entries of December 7 and 8 and is placed by date. The following less detailed list appears in Codex I, p. 156, reading backwards, and is brought together with the other. The list from Codex I is nearly identical to one by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> on <ref n="1806-03-16" type="related">March 16, 1806</ref>. (See note at <ref n="1806-01-29" type="related">January 29, 1806</ref>.) Both lists here are in <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> hand. Obviously the captains gathered this information from the Indians at the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. We have made an attempt to identify these men from what information is available about early trading ventures in the area. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> evidently understood that these skippers had been at the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name> recently, which is not the case, so far as the record shows, with some of the men referred to in these notes. Some of them may have made other voyages which are not in the records, or the language barrier may have confused the information, although many of the Indians had some English. The principal source is the researches of Frederick W. Howay.</note>
