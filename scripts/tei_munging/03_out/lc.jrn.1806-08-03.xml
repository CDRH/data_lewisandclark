I arrose early this morning and had the perogue and canoes loaded and set out at half after 6 A. M.    we soon passed the canoe of <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> who were on shore hunting, the men hailed them but received no answer we proceeded, and shortly after overtook <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J.</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name> who had killed 25 deer since they left us yesterday; deer are very abundant in the timbered bottoms of the river and extreemly gentle.    we did not halt today to cook and dine as usual having directed that in future the party should cook as much meat in the evening after encamping as would be sufficient to serve them the next day; by this means we forward our journey at least 12 or 15 miles Pr. day.    we saw but few buffaloe in the course of this day, tho' a greater number of Elk, deer, wolves, some bear, beaver, geese a few ducks, the party coloured covus,<ref target="n37080301" n="1"/> one Callamet Eagle,<ref target="n37080302" n="2"/> a number of bald Eagles,<ref target="n37080303" n="3"/> red headed woodpeckers &amp;c.    we encamped this evening on N. E. side of the river 2 ms. above our encampment of the 12th of May 1805.<ref target="n37080304" n="4"/>    soon after we encamp <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> killed a fat doe.    the <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fieldses</name> arrived at dark with the flesh of two fine bucks, besides which they had killed two does since we passed them making in all 29 deer since yesterday morning. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> did not overtake us this evening.

last night the Musquetors was so troublesom that no one of the party Slept half the night.    for my part I did not Sleep one hour.    those tormenting insects found their way into My beare and tormented me the whole night.    they are not less noumerous or troublesome this morning.    at 2 miles passed the enterance of Jo <name type="place" key="Charbonneau (Joseph Field's) Creek">Field's Creek</name>
                  <ref target="n37080306" n="6"/> 35 yds wide imediately above a high bluff which is falling into the river very fast.    on the Side of this bluff I saw Some of the Mountain Bighorn animals. I assended the hill below the Bluff.    the Musquetors were So noumerous that I could not Shute with any Certainty and therefore Soon returned to the Canoes. I had not proceeded far before I saw a large gangue of ewes &amp; yearlins &amp; fawns or lambs of the bighorn, and at a distance alone I saw a ram.    landed and Sent <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labeech</name> to kill the ram, which he did kill and brought him on board.    this ram is not near as large as maney I have Seen.    however he is Sufficiently large for a Sample    I directed <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratten</name> to Skin him with his head horns &amp; feet to the Skin and Save all the bone. I have now the Skin &amp; bone of a Ram a Ewe<ref target="n37080307" n="7"/> &amp; a yearlin ram of those big Horn animals.    at 8. A. M. I arived at the Junction of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Rochejhone</name> with the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, and formed my Camp imediately in the point between the two river at which place the party had all encamped the 26th of April—1805.<ref target="n37080308" n="8"/>    at landing I observed Several Elk feeding on the young willows in the point among which was a large Buck Elk which I shot &amp; had his flesh dryed in the Sun for a Store down the river.    had the Canoes unloaded and every article exposed to dry &amp; Sun. Maney of our things were wet, and nearly all the Store of meat which had been killed above Spoiled. I ordered it to be thrown into the river. Several Skins are also Spoiled which is a loss, as they are our principal dependance for Clothes to last us to our homes &amp;c.</p>
