We dispatched <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name> early this morning to hunt on the road and indeavour to obtain some meat for us.    just as we had prepared to set out at an early hour a deer came in to lick at these springs and one of our hunters killed it; this secured us our dinners, and we proceeded down the creek sometimes in the bottoms and at other times on the top or along the steep sides of the ridge to the N. of the Creek.    at one mile from the springs we passed a stout branch of the creek on the north side and at noon having travelled 13 ms. we arrived at the entrance of a second Northen branch of the creek<ref target="n36063001" n="1"/> where we had nooned it on the 12th of Septr. last.    here we halted, dined and graized our horses.    while here <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Sheilds</name> took a small tern<ref target="n36063002" n="2"/> and killed a deer.    at this place a road turns off to the wright which the indians informed us leads to <name type="place"
                        key="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River">Clarks river</name>
                  <ref target="n36063003" n="3"/> some distance below where there is a fine extensive vally in which the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Shalees</name> or <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Ootslashshoots</name> sometimes reside.    in descending the creek this morning on the steep side of a high hill my horse sliped and both his hinder feet out of the road and fell, I also fell off backwards and slid near 40 feet down the hill before I could stop myself such was the steepness of the declivity; the horse was near falling on me in the first instance but fortunately recovers and we both escaped unhirt. I saw a small grey squirrel<ref target="n36063004" n="4"/> today much like those of the <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name> coast only that the belly of this was white. I also met with the plant in blume which is sometimes called the lady's slipper or mockerson flower.<ref target="n36063005" n="5"/>    it is in shape and appearance like ours only that the corolla is white, marked with small veigns of pale red longitudinally on the inner side.    after dinner we resumed our march. soon after seting out <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Sheilds</name> killed another deer and in the course of the evening we picked up three others which <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> had killed along the road making a total of 6 today. Deer are very abundant in the neighborhood of <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">travellers rest</name> of both speceis,<ref target="n36063006" n="6"/> also some bighorns<ref target="n36063007" n="7"/> and Elk.    a little before sunset we arrived at our old encampment on the south side of the creek a little above it's entrance into <name type="place"
                        key="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River">Clark's river</name>.<ref target="n36063008" n="8"/>    here we encamped with a view to remain two days in order to rest ourselves and horses &amp; make our final arrangements for seperation.    we came 19 ms. after dinner the road being much better than it has been since we entered the mountains    we found no appearance of the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Ootslashshoots</name> having been here lately.    the indians express much concern for them and apprehend that the <name type="native_nation" key="Atsina Indians">Minnetares of fort de Prarie</name> have distroyed them in the course of the last winter and spring, and mention the tracks of the bearfoot Indians which we saw yesterday as an evidence of their being much distressed.—    our horses have stood the journey supprisingly well, most of them are yet in fine order, and only want a few days rest to restore them perfectly.—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 30th.</hi>    We continued our march early and had a fine morning. When we were ready to set out, we saw a deer coming to a lick at the hot spring, and one of our hunters shot it. Two hunters went on ahead. At noon another went out a short time, and killed a fine deer. We halted for dinner at the same place, where we dined on the 12 of Sept. 1805,<ref target="n36063013" n="13"/> as we passed over to the Western ocean. After dinner we proceeded on, and on 
our way found three deer that one of the hunters<ref target="n36063014" n="14"/> had killed and left for us. 
In the evening we arrived at <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travellers'-rest creek</name>,<ref target="n36063015" n="15"/> where the party rested 
two days last fall, and where it empties into <name type="place"

Here we encamped and meet with the hunters.
