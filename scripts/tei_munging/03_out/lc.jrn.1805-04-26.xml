This morning I dispatched <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> up the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name> with orders to examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the same evening; two others were directed to bring in the meat we had killed last evening, while I proceeded down the river with one man<ref target="n11042601" n="1"/> in order to take a view of the confluence of this great river with the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, which we found to be two miles distant on a direct line N. W. from our encampment.    the bottom land on the lower side of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name> near it's mouth for about one mile in width appears to be subject to inundation; while that on the opposite side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and the point formed by the junction of these rivers is of the common elivation, say from twelve to 18 feet above the level of the water, and of course not liable to be overflown except in extreem high water, which dose not appear to be very frequent    there is more timber in the neighbourhood of the junction of these rivers, and on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> as far below as the <name type="place" key="Little Muddy (White Earth) River">White earth river</name>, than there is on any part of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> above the entrance of the <name type="place" key="Cheyenne River">Chyenne river</name> to this place.    the timber consists principally of Cottonwood, with some small elm, ash and boxalder.<ref target="n11042602" n="2"/>    the under growth on the sandbars and verge of the river is the small leafed willow; the low bottoms, rose bushes which rise to three or four fe[e]t high, the redburry, servicebury, and the redwood; the high bottoms are of two discriptions either timbered or open; the first lies next to the river and it's under brush is the same with that of the low timbered bottoms with the addition of the broaf leafed willow, Goosbury, choke cherry, purple currant; and honeysuckle bushis; the open bottoms border on the hills, and are covered in many parts by the wild hyssop which rises to the hight of two feet. I observe that the Antelope, Buffaloe Elk and deer feed on this herb; the willow of the sandbars also furnish a favorite winter food to these anamals as well as the growse, the porcupine, hare, and rabbit.<ref target="n11042603" n="3"/>    about 12 Olock I heard the discharge of several guns at the junction of the rivers, which announced to me the arrival of the paty with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>; I afterwards learnt that they had fired on some buffaloe which they met with at that place, and of which they killed a cow and several Calves; the latter are now fine veal. I dispatched one of the men to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> requesting him to send up a canoe to take down the meat we had killed and our baggage to his encampmt, which was accordingly complyed with.    after I had completed my observations in the evening I walked down and joined the party at their encampment on the point of land fromed by the junction of the rivers;<ref target="n11042604" n="4"/> found them all in good health, and much pleased at having arrived at this long wished for spot, and in order to add in some measure to the general pleasure which seemed to pervade our little community, we ordered a dram to be issued to each person; this soon produced the fiddle, and they spent the evening with much hilarity, singing &amp; dancing, and seemed as perfectly to forget their past toils, as they appeared regardless of those to come.    in the evening, the man I had sent up the river this morning returned, and reported that he had ascended it about eight miles on a streight line; that he found it crooked, meandering from side to side of the valley formed by it; which is from four to five miles wide.    the corrent of the river gentle, and it's bed much interrupted and broken by sandbars; at the distance of five miles he passed a large Island well covered with timber, and three miles higher a large creek falls in on the S. E. side<ref target="n11042605" n="5"/> above a high bluff in which there are several stratas of coal.<ref target="n11042606" n="6"/>    the country bordering on this river as far as he could percieve, like that of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, consisted of open plains.    he saw several of the bighorned anamals in the couse of his walk;<ref target="n11042607" n="7"/> but there were so shy that he could not get a shoot at them; he found a large horn of one of these anamals which he brought with him.    the bed of the yellowstone river is entirely composed of sand and mud, not a stone of any kind to be seen in it near it's entrance. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> measured these rivers just above their confluence; found the bed of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> 520 yards wide, the water occupying 330.    it's channel deep.    the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name> including it's sandbar, 858 yds, of which, the water occupyed 297 yards; the depest part 12 feet; it was falling at this time &amp; appeard to be nearly at it's summer tide.—    the Indians inform that the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name> is navigable for perogues and canoes nearly to it's source in the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>, and that in it's course near these mountains it passes within less than half a day's march of a navigable part of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    it's extreem sources are adjacent to those of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, <name type="place" key="Platte River (Nebr.)">river platte</name>, and I think probably with some of the South branch of the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>.<ref target="n11042608" n="8"/>    the first part of its course lies through a mountanous rocky country tho' well timbered and in many parts fertile; the middle, and much the most extensive portion of the river lies through a delightfull rich and fertile country, well covered with timber, intersperced with plains and meadows, and well watered; it is some what broken in many parts.    the lower portion consists of fertile open plains and meadows almost entirely, tho' it possesses a considerable proportion of timber on it's borders.    the current of the upper portion is extreemly rappid, that of the middle and lower portions much more gentle than the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    the water of this river is turbid, tho' dose not possess as much sediment as that of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    this river in it's course recieves the waters of many large tributary strams principally from the S. E. of which the most considerable are the <name type="place" key="Tongue (Le-ze-ka) River">Tongue</name> and <name type="place" key="Bighorn (Ar-sar-ta) River">bighorn</name> rivers [<hi rend="italic">NB: &amp; <name type="place"

I could observe no regular stratas of it, tho' it lies on the sides of the river hills in large irregular masses, in considerable quantities; it is of a light colour, and appears to be of an excellent quality.—<ref target="n11042610" n="10"/>

emence numbers of antelopes in the forks of the river, Buffalow &amp; Elk &amp; Deer is also plenty    beaver is in every bend.

M, having went 10 Miles, and arrived at the River's mouth called <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Roshjone</name>,<ref target="n11042622" n="22"/> where we came too, in Order to wait for <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> and his party.—    who had not arrived yet here, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> shortly after our arrival here, sent a party out a hunting, and directed them to proceed up to the Point of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">River Roshjone</name>; and then proceeded to assertain the Width of both Rivers at this place.—    〈he〉 they found on measuring these Rivers, that the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">River Mesouri</name> was 337 Yards wide; and very deep; and the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">River Roshjone</name> at its mouth, 97 Yards wide, and continued the same width for a considerable distance up it.—    The <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">River Roshjone</name> is a Shallow River, the water in it is Clear and its current rapid.—    The mouth of this River is 1,888 Miles, from the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri River</name>, and 279 Miles from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>.    The Country here is Priaries, and some thickets of Trees, the land appears very rich &amp; fertile.—    In the Evening we were Joined by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> and his party.—    They had killed several buffaloes, Antelopes, and Deer; which they brought with them and a Buffalo Calf alive, which had followed them 7 or 8 Miles, it being common for the Buffalo Calves, when separated from their dams, to follow the hunters.—</p>
               <p>
The party that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> had sent out hunting returned; bringing with them, a number of Buffalo Calves which they had killed—    The game at this season of the year being poor, the flesh of the Buffalo Calves, was a welcome supply to us, they being in general in good Order, and in Taste very &amp; [<hi rend="italic">illegible, crossed out</hi>] like Veal 〈much like it as well as〉 and had much the resemblance of Veal in its appearance, We found a great many signs of Beaver in the bottoms on both Rivers.—    The place that we encamped in this Evening; 〈is〉 was a handsome point, lying on the South side of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">River Roshjone</name>
               </p>
               <p>
