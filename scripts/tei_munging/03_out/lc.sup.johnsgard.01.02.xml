               <p>Until the Corps of Discovery reached the vicinity of present-day <name type="place" key="Kansas">Kansas</name> (the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Kansas (Decaugh, Kaw) River">Kansas River</name>) in late June, they had
                  not entered true wilderness and had made only one zoological discovery of
                  interest—their capture on May 31, 1804, of several specimens of the eastern
                  woodrat (<hi rend="italic">Neotoma floridana</hi>) in the woods near the mouth of
                  the <name type="place" key="Osage (Osarge) River">Osage River</name>, in <name type="place" key="Osage County, Kans.">Osage</name> and <name type="place" key="Calloway County, Mo.">Calloway</name> Counties. It was almost another
                  month before they had pushed upstream far enough to reach the <name type="place" key="Kansas (Decaugh, Kaw) River">Kansas River</name>, near which they saw
                  Carolina parakeets and encountered two villages of <name type="native_nation" key="Kansa Indians">Kansa</name> natives.</p>
               <p>They reached the present border of <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name> on July 11, camping near the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Big Nemaha River">Big Nemaha River</name> on the <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name> side and the <name type="place" key="Tarkio River">Tarkio River</name> on the <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name> side. By then they were traveling along the so-named <name type="place" key="Bald-pated Prairie">bald-pated hills</name>. These tall,
                  loess-formed hills of western Iowa were covered at their lower levels by hardwood
                  forests, but often were capped with native prairie. On July 12, a short distance
                  upstream from the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Big Nemaha River">Big
                     Nemaha River</name>, they observed some low "artificial" mounds representing
                  the sites of old Native American burial grounds. On the morning of July 30 the
                  group arrived at a high bluff on the <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name> side that is now part of <name type="place" key="Fort Calhoun, Nebr.">Fort Calhoun</name>. There they camped for four days
                  and held a council with the assembled chiefs of the <name type="native_nation" key="Oto Indians">Otoe</name>-<name type="native_nation" key="Missouri Indians">Missouria</name> tribe. This council was the first held between the natives of
                  the central <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> Valley and the
                  U.S. government, and the bluff was thus named <name type="place" key="Council Bluff (Nebr.)">Council Bluff</name>. It later became the site of
                     <name type="place" key="Camp Missouri (Nebr.)">Camp Missouri</name>, the first
                  military post in <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>, subsequently
                  renamed <name type="place" key="Fort Calhoun, Nebr.">Fort Calhoun</name>.</p>
               <p>On August 13 the group passed <name type="place" key="Omaha (Mahar) Creek">Omaha
                     Creek</name> and camped at an old <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name> village that night. On August 16 they seined
                  more than 1,000 fish of at least ten species at this "fishing camp," none of which
                  Elliott Coues could identify with certainty on the basis of the names that the men
                  used. Fish caught in the <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>-<name type="place" key="Iowa">Iowa</name> region and farther up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name> did include some
                  remarkably large catfish (see the <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>
                  chapter in this book). They remained in the <name type="place" key="Omaha, Nebr.">Omaha</name> vicinity until August 19, and then began north again. On August
                  20, 1804, <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Sergeant Floyd</name> died of a
                  probable burst appendix and was buried on a high bluff just south of present-day
                     <name type="place" key="Sioux City, Iowa">Sioux City</name>, <name type="place" key="Iowa">Iowa</name>. The next day the group passed the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Big Sioux River (Rivière des Sioux)">Big Sioux
                     River</name>, camping in what is now <name type="place" key="Dakota County, Nebr.">Dakota County</name>, <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>, with the <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name> boundary on the opposite shore. The following day (August
                  22) they passed <name type="place" key="Ionia Creek">Ionia Creek</name> and camped
                  in what is now <name type="place" key="Union County, S. Dak.">Union County</name>,
                     <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>. By September 7 they
                  had passed out of what is now the shoreline of <name type="place" key="Boyd County, Nebr.">Boyd County</name>, <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>, and were then entirely within the present boundaries of <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>.</p>
               <p>The return trip was relatively rapid, the party arriving in what is now northern
                     <name type="place" key="Boyd County, Nebr.">Boyd County</name>, <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>, on August 29, 1806. They passed
                  the mouths of the <name type="place" key="Niobrara (Quicurre, Rapid) River">Niobrara</name>, <name type="place" key="James (Jacque) River (S. Dak.)">James</name>, and <name type="place" key="Vermillion (White Stone) River (S. Dak.)">Vermillion</name> Rivers on
                  September 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On September 8 they passed <name type="place" key="Council Bluff (Nebr.)">Council Bluff</name>, and the next day the mouth of
                  the <name type="place" key="Platte River (Nebr.)">Platte River</name>. They passed
                  the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Big Nemaha River">Big Nemaha River</name>
                  and entered present-day <name type="place" key="Kansas">Kansas</name> on September
                  11. On September 15 they passed the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Kansas (Decaugh, Kaw) River">Kansas River</name> and reentered <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>. They reached the confluence of the
                     <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> Rivers on September 23, 1806, and
                  were finally home.</p>

                        one of the party on January 18, 1805. The species was called a "brarow" by
                        the expedition members. The <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Oglala">Oglala branch of the Lakotas</name> regarded
                        the badger as having great strength and tenacity, and its symbolic powers
                        extended to the healing of sick children.</p>

                     <p>Beavers were first encountered on the outward journey near present-day <name type="place" key="Leavenworth, Kans.">Leavenworth</name>, <name type="place" key="Kansas">Kansas</name>. They were seen again near <name type="place" key="Council Bluffs, Iowa">Council Bluffs</name>, <name type="place" key="Iowa">Iowa</name>, and after that were regularly
                        encountered, being trapped at nearly every stopping point. In <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name> alone they were reported from
                        at least 33 locations. In his summary of the natural history of the
                        expedition, Raymond Burroughs calculated that at least 113 beaver were
                        killed over the entire expedition period. Three decades after the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expedition, Maximilian,
                        Prince of Wied, reported that in a single year 25,000 beaver pelts were
                        brought into <name type="place" key="Fort Union (N. Dak.)">Fort
                        Union</name>. Beavers were already becoming rare only a decade later, when
                        John J. Audubon visited the same fort. At the time of the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expedition, North
                        American beavers were highly valuable as pelts and were classified as the
                        same species as the Old World beaver, but in 1820 they were recognized as
                        separate types. After great overharvesting and near disappearance, the North
                        American beaver has now recovered its former range and may be more common
                        than at any time in the past century.</p>

                        until they had nearly reached the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Kansas (Decaugh, Kaw) River">Kansas River</name>. A large herd of

                        least 227 bison were killed during the expedition. The last known wild

                        Swenk tentatively identified this species as the lark bunting (<hi rend="italic">Calamospiza melanocorys</hi>). However, by August the lark
                        bunting's breeding season is over, and males would be molting out of their
                        nearly all-black breeding plumage and into a brown plumage. Other more
                        common and permanently black-plumaged birds in that region are better
                        possibilities, including various blackbirds and grackles. Gary Moulton has
                        suggested that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
                        observed the red-winged blackbird, which seems a much more likely choice, as
                        by late August these abundant birds would be forming migratory flocks. One
                        of the most numerous of North American songbirds, this species may number in
                        excess of 100 million birds. However, although it probably increased greatly
                        during the first half of the twentieth century, its overall population has
                        been declining significantly over the past four decades as breeding habitats
                        have been increasingly converted to agriculture.</p>

                           <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>. However, unidentified
                        ducks were also seen in some numbers during the river ascent through <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>, from as early as August 15,
                        1804 (present-day <name type="place" key="Dakota County, Nebr.">Dakota
                           County</name>), to September 5, 1804 (present-day <name type="place" key="Thurston County, Nebr.">Thurston</name> or <name type="place" key="Burt County, Nebr.">Burt County</name>). As Swenk concluded, these
                        most probably were wood ducks, which would have been common along the wooded

                        in late summer. Wood ducks were also reportedly seen in the vicinity of

                        America during the last four decades, and their breeding range has expanded
                        both to the west and north, partly as a result of the widespread erection of
