This morning was calm fair and warm; the Musquetoes of course troublesome.    all hands that could work were employed about the canoes.    which we completed and launched this evening.    the one was 25 feet and the other 33 feet in length and about 3 feet wide.    we have now the seats and oars to make and fit &amp;c. I walked out today and ascended the bluffs which are high rockey and steep; I continued my rout about 3½ when I gained a <ref target="n16071401" n="1">conspicuous eminence about 2 mes. distant from the river a little below the entrance of <name type="place" key="Fort Mountain Creek">Fort Mountain Creek</name>.</ref>    from this place I had a commanding view of the country and took the bearings of the following places. <ref target="n16071402" n="2">(viz)</ref>

               <p>The country in most parts very level and in others swelling with gentle rises and decents, or in other wirds what I have heretofore designated a wavy country destitute of timber except along the water-courses. On my return to camp found <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name> had arrived with all the canoes about noon and had unloaded them     every preperation except the entire completion of the oars poles &amp;c is made for our departure tomorrow.    the grass and weeds in this bottom are about 2 feet high; which is a much greater hight than we have seen them elsewhere this season.     here I found the <ref target="n16071403" n="3">sand rush and nittles in small quantities.</ref>    the grass in the plains is not more than 3 inches high.    grasshoppers innumerable in the plains and the small birds before noticed together with the <ref target="n16071404" n="4">brown Curlooe</ref> still continue nomerous in every part of the plains.—</p>
