The winter at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

The winter would try the expedition's diplomatic skill and expand its ethnographic horizons. At the same time, the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> people would get their first long look at the coming wave of American traders and bureaucrats. Those long <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name> months were an apprenticeship during which each group probed the other and formed lasting impressions.</p>
               <p>
A traveler coming up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> from <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> in 1804 would have found five Indian settlements—two <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and three <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>—strung out along the river in what is now central <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>. Past the <name type="place" key="Heart (Ches-che-tar and similar spellings) River">Heart River</name>, the first town was the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village known to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> as <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Matootonha</name>. More correctly named <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>, this village was located on the west bank of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> described <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> as "situated on an eminance of about 50 feet above the water in a handsome plain."<ref target="n0402" n="2"/> Like its sister village across the river, <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> was built by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"

                  </ref> sometime around 1787. In most of their notes, the explorers referred to <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> as the "lower" or "first" <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> reported that the village had about forty earth lodges. Because <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> was the closest <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village to the expedition's winter quarters, the explorers became very familiar with both the town and its leading chiefs. <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>, known to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> as <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Big White</name>, was the most prominent civil chief in <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>. The captains named <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Kagohhami, or Little Raven</name>, also a civil chief, as Second Chief.</p>
               <p>
Farther up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, directly north of <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> and on the east bank of the river, was the second <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> settlement. Throughout the expedition's records this town of about forty or fifty earth lodges was called <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>. <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> was a mispronunciation of Nuptadi, one of the four <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> subtribes existing before the 1781 smallpox epidemic. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> often called <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> the "upper" or "second" <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village. Because it was the home of <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Posecopsahe</name>, or <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>, the civil chief designated Grand <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> Chief by the explorers, <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> took on special significance for the expedition's diplomacy. <name type="person" key="Raven Man Chief (Car-gar-no-mok-she)">Cargarnomakshe, or Raven Man Chief</name>, was made Second Chief of <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> by the captains.</p>
               <p>
Directly across the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> from <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> was a <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> village so distinct from the two other <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> towns that virtually every European visitor noted the differences. Known as <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name>, the village was established about 1787 by the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi Hidatsas</name>. Built on a terrace overlooking the confluence of the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife</name> and the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> rivers, <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name> had about fifty warriors in 1804. The captains knew these people as the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Amahami, Ahaharway, or Wattasoon Indians</name> and always distinguished them in their records from the two other <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> groups. Although the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawis</name> were linguistically distinct from their <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> neighbors on the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>, they were not a separate tribe as <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> believed. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawis</name> called themselves <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Ahaharways or Ahnahaways</name>; <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Wattasoon</name> was their <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> name. French traders nicknamed them the "soulier" Indians and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> occasionally termed the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawis</name> as the Shoe or Moccasin people. The captains had some contact with the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi Hidatsas</name> of <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name> through <name type="person" key="White Buffalo Robe Unfolded (Ta-tuck-copinrehas)">Tatuckcopinreha, or White Buffalo Robe Unfolded</name>, the most prominent village chief.</p>

On the right bank of the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife</name>, about a mile from the confluence of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, was the town <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> called the "First <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetaree</name> Village," or "the little village of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Menitarras</name>." Built about 1787 by <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa Hidatsas</name> and home to a substantial number of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> families as well, the village was properly known as <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name>. Village residents were sometimes named in expedition journals as <name type="place" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetarees Metaharta</name> or the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetarees of the Willows</name>. <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name> has special significance for the history of the expedition since it was there that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Shoshoni.html"

Observing <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages during the summer of 1806, <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the Younger</name> described them as "a cluster of molehills or muskrat cabins." The trader explained that on closer examination "the nearly circular huts are placed very irregularly; some so close to each other as scarcely to leave a foot-passage, others again at a distance of 20 to 30 feet apart. But about the center of each village is an open space of about four acres, around which the huts are regularly built at equal distances, fronting the open space."<ref target="n0404" n="4"/> For both <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> households the village was the focus of important political, economic, and ceremonial activities. In many ways the villages can be best understood as a collection of households all acting together to advance the welfare of the family, the clan, and the village.</p>
               <p>
Just as the medicine lodge was the focal point for <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> villages, the center of a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village was the sacred cedar post and the open plaza around it. The cedar post represented <name type="person" key="Lone Man">Lone Man</name>, the primary <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> culture hero. On the north edge of the plaza was the large medicine or Okipa lodge. Hanging on poles outside the Okipa lodge were effigies representing various spirits. The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages seen by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> consisted of about forty to fifty domestic lodges arranged around the plaza. The social position of each household determined the location of lodges. Those families with important ceremonial responsibilities and those who owned powerful bundles lived near the plaza while less prominent households occupied lodges farther away. <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> earth lodges were usually occupied for anywhere between seven to twelve years. Each lodge housed from five to sixteen persons with the average number in a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> lodge being ten persons.<ref target="n0405" n="5"/> At the time of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages were defended by log palisades.</p>
               <p>
These villages, so familiar from the descriptions of explorers and traders like <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the Younger</name> and nineteenth-century artists like George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, were in fact only part of the settled experience of the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> villagers. They divided their time between large, permanent summer lodge towns and smaller winter camps. The winter lodges, built in wooded bottoms to escape the harsh winter storms, were neither large nor especially well constructed. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> did not comment on these winter camps, and it is possible that fear of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

Toward the end of October 1804, as the expedition passed the <name type="place" key="Cannonball (Bullet) River">Cannonball River</name>, the explorers began to notice abandoned <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages. On October 19, the captains saw the ruins of a sturdy <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> settlement on a hill some ninety feet above the river. In the days that followed, as the American party passed through the old <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> homeland around the <name type="place" key="Heart (Ches-che-tar and similar spellings) River">Heart River</name>, there were even more signs of village life before the epidemic scourges of the 1780s and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

A <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> sun dance post standing alone on the prairie was a silent witness to the past.

Faced with these unsettling artifacts of a troubled past, there must have been a certain measure of relief among the explorers when, on October 24, they encountered the first live <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> Indians seen by the expedition. As the captains passed an island in the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, they came upon a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief on a fall hunt. Because one of their central diplomatic objectives was to promote an alliance of all <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name> villagers against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

The captains were sure they had moved one step closer to that goal when the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief and the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief traveling with them met "with great Cordiallity and serimony."

Expeditionary diplomacy, as well as personal expectations about those "handsome women," was slowed the next day as progress upriver became more difficult.

As the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> flotilla neared the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages, the pace of the expedition's activity increased. There were all sorts of problems that called for the captains' attention and most of those questions involved relations with the Indians. The Americans needed to prepare for full-scale talks with <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs, a prospect that required careful thought, reliable interpreters, and plenty of gifts.

                     <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>
                  </ref>. And there was the presence of Canadian and English traders on the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. These men, none of whom were American citizens, posed a unique challenge to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> Indian diplomacy. Were they to be allowed to continue trading with the Indians, thereby undercutting <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> ventures, or were they to be expelled, perhaps with a show of force? In the confused days immediately after the Louisiana Purchase, the status of those foreign traders was unclear. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> would have to tread carefully, watching the words and actions of both Indians and traders, gathering valuable information but alienating no one. American sovereignty had to be proclaimed but not so stridently as to frighten Indian trading partners. Finally, and of no little concern, a suitable location for winter quarters had to be found.</p>
               <p>
Plans to resolve those questions began to take shape on the evening of October 26, when the Americans camped in a fallow cornfield just below <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>. Earlier in the day, the captains had accepted two <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs and their household goods as temporary keelboat passengers. Now as the whole party made camp, they were joined by scores of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> men, women and children who clustered around the expedition's gear. Poking and probing all the strange objects, the Indians seemed especially attracted to the corn mill. Because <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was still suffering from a persistent rheumatic complaint and both men were unsure of their reception by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> alone joined the chiefs in making the short walk to <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>. Fears of an unfriendly reception were quickly allayed when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> was given a warm welcome. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name> cryptic "found the nation very friendly" masks the real concern the expedition had about relations with the villagers. At this early stage perhaps neither the chiefs nor the captains were quite ready to pass final judgment on each other. But it was an encouraging sign of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> friendship when the chiefs came back to the expedition's camp later in the evening and smoked with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.<ref target="n0416" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p>
That first evening of talking and smoking was important preparation for the days to come but it was, after all, only the beginning. Contact had been made with only one <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village. With much left to do, the expedition continued to make measured progress upriver on the following day. Saturday proved to be a day filled with informal visits to both <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages, considerable socializing, and an important meeting with the trader <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">René Jusseaume</name>.</p>
               <p>
Leaving camp early on Saturday morning, the expedition made its first stop at <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> hiked up the fifty-foot terrace to the stockaded town, noting as he went the earth lodges with many horses tethered outside. Once in the village, the explorer was greeted by several chiefs. Although <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> did not record which chiefs were present, it is most likely that he met <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> and perhaps <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Little Raven</name>, the Second Chief. After smoking, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was invited to remain at the village for some food. Anxious to impress their powerful visitor and perhaps make a valuable trade connection, the <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> chiefs were very displeased when <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> rejected their offer of corn and beans. That displeasure was eventually dispelled when the captain explained that he felt "indisposed" and was not prepared to take on the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> menu.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps the most important event during the two-hour visit at <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> was the meeting with <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">René Jusseaume</name>. A free trader with ties to the North West Company, <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> had been living among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> for some fifteen years and spoke their language fluently. Few whites could match <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume's</name> knowledge and experience on the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. Many fellow traders did not like the Frenchman, including <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the Younger</name>, who described him as a man whose ways were "much worse than those of a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandane</name>." The dour <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Henry</name> asserted that <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> was "possessed of every superstition natural to those people, nor is he different in every mean, dirty trick they have acquired from intercourse with the set of scoundrels who visit these parts." Although <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> were eager to hire <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> as an interpreter and informant on Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> life, they had an equally low opinion of him. Later that evening, after <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> told <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> that he had once served the elder <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> as a scout in the <name type="place" key="Illinois">Illinois</name> country during the Revolution, the explorer described him as "a cunin artful an insonce [insolent] ar—[?]."<ref target="n0417" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p>
His visit at <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> over, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> returned to the river. As the expedition passed the Nuptadi village called <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>, the banks were lined with <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> children intent on not missing a single move made by the white strangers. Opposite the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> village of <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name>, the keelboat and pirogues were anchored and camp was established. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> then took an interpreter, perhaps Jusseaume, and paid a courtesy call at <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>. Most of the men who were out hunting had now returned, and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> spent an hour talking with the village leaders <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> and <name type="person" key="Raven Man Chief (Car-gar-no-mok-she)">Raven Man Chief</name>.</p>
               <p>
With the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages all properly visited, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> now turned their attention to preparing for the important council planned for October 28. The three <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages had not yet been invited, and it was imperative that they be part of any negotiations. The captains selected three runners, perhaps young <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> warriors, to carry carrots of tobacco to the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> towns to symbolize the Americans' cordial wish to talk. Erecting a flag pole, checking the supply of gifts, and sending invitations were only part of the preparations made that night. There was the pressing matter of political intelligence. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> needed to know the names of the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs and prominent men, as well as something of the way they might respond to the proposals offered by the captains. For all their dislike of <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name>, it was to him that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> turned for "some information of the chiefs of the different nations." <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume's</name> thorough knowledge of village politics is reflected in the complete list of Indian notables <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> composed on October 29. With all these matters in hand, the expedition welcomed overnight <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> visitors and bedded down for another night along the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.<ref target="n0418" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p>
The grand council bringing together <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>, <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>, <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>, and United States representatives was to take place on Sunday, October 28, 1804. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> described the level flood plain across the river from <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name> as "the most convenient place to hold a council with the whole nation." By midmorning <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> representing all three villages began to gather at the conference ground. Everything seemed in order before noon except the weather. Just as high winds had delayed talks with the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>, so now a strong gale from the Southwest turned the captains' plans upside down. Blowing sand picked up by the fierce wind stung everyone's face, and the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> became so rough that <name type="native_nation" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> and the other <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> chiefs could not cross to the meeting site.</p>
               <p>
Their plans gone awry, the captains spent the day entertaining the chiefs who were already there. Tours of the keelboat were conducted for the visiting dignitaries, who promptly pronounced it and <name type="person" key="York">York</name> to be "great medicine." <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>, and an interpreter then walked about a mile and a half up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> looking for a good location for the future <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. Although many places seemed promising, all lacked sufficient supplies of timber. The captains also used their time with the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief to ask him about leadership in the five villages. <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>, whom <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> came to rely on more and more during the winter, provided the names of twelve prominent chiefs to flesh out the information obtained from <name type="native_nation" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name>. There was also time for some friendly gift giving. Several women brought corn and boiled hominy; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> responded by offering a large glazed earthenware jar to <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat's</name> wife, "who receved it with much pleasure." Other members of the expedition indulged in some sightseeing. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> poked around <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>, noting the design of the village and marveling at the way <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> corpses were arranged on scaffolds outside the town. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>, who had caught two beavers the night before, probably did some more pelt hunting.<ref target="n0419" n="19"/> Hoping that the weather on Monday would be more favorable, the explorers again made their diplomatic arrangements. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs were asked to smoke with <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> and remain in his village until the next day. Despite these delays, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> were confident that they could persuade the Indian delegates to accept what might be called "the American Plan."</p>
               <p>
As <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> entered the crucial talks, they had several objectives in mind. Some were the same as those pursued in meetings with Indians lower down the river while others were unique to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-<name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> situation on the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. Of the goals that represented a continuity with earlier Indian conferences, two must have seemed especially important to the explorer-diplomats that Sunday evening. First, there was the vital matter of announcing American sovereignty over lands of the Louisiana Purchase. As they had done before, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> were anxious to impress on the minds of "dutiful Indian children" that they had a new and powerful father in a distant place. But sovereignty meant more than simply proclaiming <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</name> as the new Indian father. If American influence was to be substance and not shadow, men like <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> and <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> had to be made willing agents of United States policy. The second goal was closely tied to the first. American policy toward the Indians linked trade with sovereignty. Proclaiming ownership of new territories meant little unless some economic good would come from them. Everything that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had seen so far indicated the rich possibilities for <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>-based traders. That trade could serve many purposes. Strengthening American influence while reducing the power of British agents was not the least of the captains' concerns. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> never thought that trade followed the flag.

Commerce and nationalism were certainly important objectives to be pursued in the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-<name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> talks.

                  </ref> to abandon their British suppliers and join the American traders. The vital first step in forging such a villager alliance had been taken when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> convinced some <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chiefs to make peace with the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> towns. As the captains entered the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-<name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> conference, they still believed that a few words, a bit of military pomp, and some gifts could rearrange tribal politics to suit American interests.</p>
               <p>
The weather on the morning of October 29 did not bode well for the sort of meeting the explorers had in mind. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> wrote, "The winds was so hard that it was extreemely disagreeable, the Sands was blown on us in clouds."<ref target="n0420" n="20"/> Fearing that further delays might permanently damage their prospects for success, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> decided to proceed with the gathering. To shield the participants from the nasty weather, the captains ordered an awning put up and pieces of sail cloth stretched between stakes to block the wind and flying sand.</p>
               <p>
By midmorning all seemed in order, and at eleven o'clock the bow swivel gun on the keelboat was fired to signal the start of the meeting. Expeditionary records do not make it clear how many <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs were present. It is certain that <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name>, the powerful <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>-proper chief, was not present, nor was <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>. Those who did attend included <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> and the important <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>-proper chief <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name>. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> began the session by giving a long speech interpreted through <name type="native_nation" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name>, "the Substance of which [was] Similer to what we had Delivered to the nations below." That stock speech stressed the themes of United States sovereignty, American trade, and intertribal peace. Such proposals did not seem novel to the captains, but they did amount to substantial changes in the ways the five <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages did business with both native and white outsiders. Even before <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> introduced the touchy matter of peace with the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> and a villager alliance against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

                     <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>
                  </ref>, there were signs of displeasure. The most visible one came from <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name>. Although he had given up much formal power to <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name>, <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name> retained considerable influence among the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>-proper. As <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> spoke, the chief became increasingly restless and finally seemed ready to leave the council. When questioned, <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name> excused his unhappy reaction to the American proposals by claiming that his village stood in imminent danger of attack from unnamed but hostile Indians. One of the chiefs quickly saw through this deception and "rebuked [<name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name>] for his uneasiness at Such a time as the present." <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota's</name> "uneasiness" was probably a reflection of the close ties <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name> and the other <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages had to English traders, as well as a dislike for outsiders who dared dictate policy to the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>. But at this point in the proceedings <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota's</name> actions did not seem worrisome and the captains had no reason to think that there would be serious <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> opposition to any part of the American design.</p>
               <p>
At the end of the speech, the captains introduced the most controversial element on their diplomatic agenda. The assembled Indians must have known that the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief sitting in the council was more than window dressing. Now was the time to open the issue of an <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> peace with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"

                  </ref> and the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> as a preliminary to a general villager coalition. The captains did not record the words they used to propose the peace treaty, but what does survive is evidence of a significant gesture. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, by now acquainted with the protocol of plains diplomacy, took a pipe, smoked it and passed it to the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief. That pipe was in turn handed around to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> representatives. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> noted later, "They all smoked with eagerness out of the pipe held by the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Ricara</name> chief."<ref target="n0421" n="21"/> To demonstrate the importance of the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief and to enhance his status among the other chiefs, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> gave him an American dollar coin as a medal, "with which he was much pleased," as well as a certificate verifying his "sincereity and good conduct."</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> did not know until much later that the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> had privately blasted the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> as "liars and bad men." Speaking directly to the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief sometime after the council, <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> accused the <name type="place"
                        key="Grand (We-tar-hoo and similar spellings) River (S. Dak.)">Grand River</name> villagers of treachery in killing <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> representatives who had earlier sought peace. Whenever there was conflict between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>, the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief insisted that the instigators were always the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>. But <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> boasted that in those violent encounters <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> warriors killed the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> "like the buffalo." With a candor not shown to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> said to the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief, "We will make peace with you as our two fathers have directed, and they shall see that we will not be the Ogressors, but we fear the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Ricares</name> will not be at peace long."<ref target="n0422" n="22"/>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> did not hear about the acrimonious exchange until the end of November. Had they known about <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> reservations earlier, the American diplomats might not have been so sanguine in their expectations.</p>
               <p>
Relieved that the peace overture had evidently been well received, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> moved on to the next item—designating chiefs and distributing gifts. As they had done before, the captains were determined to "mint" chiefs whether the American stamp meant anything or not. Indians accepted the uniforms, medals, certificates, and flags as symbols of respect but had no intention of relinquishing political autonomy or cultural identity. Appointing men like <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> or <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> was essentially a meaningless exercise, but it fulfilled bureaucratic imperative. "With much serimony," the expedition handed out medals, coats, hats, flags, and other goods to those selected to receive American honors. Knowing that <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> was too important to be overlooked even though he was out hunting, the captains gave <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name> a suit of clothes for the chief. For the old <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>-proper chief himself, there was a supply of gifts, a flag, and some wampum. Because <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> knew so little about the politics of <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name> and <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>, they named no chiefs for those villages but simply listed a number of prominent warriors for the expedition's record. Unlike other earlier Indian conferences that ended with a general distribution of gifts to natives of all sorts and ranks, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> limited their presents to the chiefs and elders. That action caused considerable resentment, since most Indians persisted in viewing the expedition as a trading venture.</p>
               <p>
With the conference nearly over, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> asked the Indians for their replies as soon as possible. The proceedings ended as they began with a display of American firepower. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> fired his airgun, "which appeared to astonish the natives very much." The council concluded, most of the Indian participants drifted away, perhaps still wondering just what all the high-flown words and gifts really meant.</p>
               <p>
But for <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the day was not yet over. Later that evening the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief came to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> with an unwelcome request. The chief was beginning to feel uncomfortable in the company of so many recent enemies and wanted to return immediately to the <name type="place"
                        key="Grand (We-tar-hoo and similar spellings) River (S. Dak.)">Grand River</name> villages. With negotiations on the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> peace still in progress, his departure could cause delay and suspicion. With a string of wampum and a promise that the talks would be successful, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was able to forestall the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara's</name> departure. Having done that, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> might have noted how busy the day had been. Indeed, it had been so filled with diplomatic comings and goings that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> forgot to wind the expedition's chronometer.<ref target="n0423" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p>
If <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expected quick answers to the American proposals, they were to be disappointed. There was no <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> tribal council; each village had to spend considerable time formulating a response. There was a <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> tribal council, created about 1797 or 1798, but each of the three villages retained virtual autonomy in dealings with powerful outsiders.<ref target="n0424" n="24"/> Despite their experience in earlier negotiations with the Indians, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> still assumed that they were dealing with nation states possessing bureaucratic machinery able to formulate and enforce a single response to a diplomatic proposal. In the three weeks that followed the grand council, the captains got not one answer but many. And they encountered more questions and hostility than expected.</p>
               <p>
On the day after the conference, <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> and Ohheenar, an adopted <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Cheyenne.html"
                       rend="box">

Out hunting the day of the meeting, they were now eager to hear the speeches and share in the honors and gifts. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> offered the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs a synopsis of the American plan and ceremoniously placed a medal around <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke's</name> neck. Knowing that they would have to wait a bit longer for responses to their plans, the captains divided the rest of the day between continuing the search for winter quarters and trading with the dozens of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> who were now becoming a regular part of camp life. From the camp opposite <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name>, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> took eight men in a pirogue and sailed seven miles up toward the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>. On one of the islands in the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, he found a good supply of wood but decided that the site was too distant from the water. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was beginning to think that a location lower down the river and closer to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages might prove the best choice. Throughout the afternoon the expedition's camp was filled with Indians eager to exchange corn and cornmeal bread for a variety of trade goods. The expedition needed to lay in a substantial store of food for the long winter. These trading days fulfilled that need while furthering good relations between the explorers and their neighbors. As the cool October afternoon slipped into evening, everyone danced and drank, "which pleased the Savages much." And in the twilight there was something else that pleased the captains. Into camp came the <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Raven</name>, Second Chief at <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>, with an invitation from <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>. The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief wanted to talk, and he promised to give many bags of corn as a sign of good faith. The <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Raven</name> also said that he was prepared to accompany the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief back to the <name type="place"
                        key="Grand (We-tar-hoo and similar spellings) River (S.

               </p>
               <p>
The last day of October 1804 marked the first of the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa's</name> formal replies to the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> diplomatic offensive. Because the captains believed that <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> was the single most powerful <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief, they were anxious to know his response. About noon, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> walked down to <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>. At the village <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was welcomed "and with great ceremoney was Seeted on a roabe by the Side of the Chief." <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> placed a fine buffalo robe over <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> shoulders, "and after smoking the pipe with several old men around" <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> began to speak.</p>
               <p>
His speech was a carefully worded reply to the American proposals—a response designed to reassure <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> friendship without tying the villages too closely to an uncertain policy. The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief went directly to the heart of the explorers' plan. Declaring that he believed what the captains said about an end to violence, <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> felt certain that a general peace would "not only give him Satisfaction but all his people." The chief graphically illustrated the benefits of such a peace, saying it would mean "they now could hunt without fear, and their womin could work in the fields without looking everry moment for the enemey." The idea of a general Indian peace was fundamental to American policy, but in the case of the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> villagers that peace had to be achieved among themselves before it could be widened to include others. <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> seemed to indicate that was a real possibility. Pointing to the <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Raven</name> and several warriors seated nearby, he indicated that these men would accompany the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief back to his village "to smoke with that people." Saying that the way was now open, <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> also showed some interest in going to see the Great Father in <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>.</p>
               <p>
If <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> had things to say that pleased <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> also had complaints. Those complaints were based on the captains' inability to explain the nature of their mission. Previous Indian-white contact had always been within the context of trade. Indians of the region had yet to encounter white soldiers or bureaucrats. The very concept of exploration as an activity apart from war or trade simply made no sense to the Indians. As the expedition went upriver, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> did give away substantial stocks of goods. The rumors that preceded the party stressed that display of wealth and raised expectations that many Indians might share in it. If the captains left behind among the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> a vivid folklore, what went ahead were tales of cloth, beads, and ironware for all. When <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> did not immediately distribute gifts in the amounts expected after the first council, there was dissatisfaction. As <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> put it plainly, "When you came up the Indians in the neighboring Villages, as well as those out hunting when they heard of you had great expectations of receving presents. Those hunting immediately on hearing returned to the Village and all was Disapointed, and Some Dissatisfied." <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> admitted that he was pleased with his gifts but reported that most in <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> expected more.</p>
               <p>
The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief concluded his speech by restoring some stolen French beaver traps whose return had been requested earlier by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Two of the traps were laid at <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> feet, along with twelve bushels of corn and several buffalo robes.

Since this was the first official contact the expedition had had with any <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief since the grand council, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> probably hoped that <name type="person" key="Tatuckcopinreha">Tatuckcopinreha</name> would respond to at least part of the American proposal.

Although the failure to get any clear statement from <name type="person" key="Tatuckcopinreha">Tatuckcopinreha</name> was unfortunate, this first day of gathering Indian reactions was successful from the captains' perspective.

The following day it was <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke's</name> turn to speak with the captains. About ten o'clock the <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> chief, accompanied by <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> and Ohheenar, came into the expedition's camp. <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> had two things on his mind, the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> peace and the future location of the expedition's winter quarters. The explorers were more interested in the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan's</name> response to their proposals; he appeared far more concerned about the site of <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

As it turned out, <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> was the one who had his priorities in order, at least as far as <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> needs were concerned. But because the white strangers were so insistent, the chief began with words about peace and the Indian alliance. <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> agreed to make peace with the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> and promised to send a delegation down to the <name type="place"

Some years before, a chief sent by the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages to smoke for peace had been murdered by the faithless <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>. Such acts fueled the continued violence and distrust, <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> declared. He boasted, "We have killed enough of them. We kill them like birds." But at the same time, <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> agreed that perhaps now was the time for a peace.

               <p>
Those were the words <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> wanted to hear. The captains were intent on accomplishing their diplomatic assignments, and obtaining assurances from both <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs must have been satisfying.

"A good peace" was not the same as a lasting one, nor was it intended to be. <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> and <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> were not talking about a fundamental rearrangement of relations between villages or tribes.

The chief's solicitude for American comfort during the winter was more apparent than real. His real concern was to keep the expedition nearby for a regular supply of trade goods and for protection against <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> raids. And there was the always troubled state of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-<name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> relations. <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> wanted a <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

All of this was couched in terms of available food for the winter, <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> claiming that it would be easier to supply the expedition's needs if the fort was closer to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages.

In the days that followed, the diplomatic pace slowed. Dropping temperatures, hard frosts, and the first signs of ice on the river were all warnings of the impending plains winter. Indian negotiations now seemed less important than building warm shelter and laying in a good supply of meat and corn. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</name> summed up the expedition's activity in early November by writing that "all the men at Camp Ocepied their time dilligenently in Building their huts and got them Made comfertable in that time to live in."<ref target="n0429" n="29"/> As <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

The daily visits of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> men and women bringing corn, beans, squash, and buffalo meat for trade now became not only a ritual of friendship but an important source of provisions. With the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> chief and a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-<name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> delegation having left for the <name type="place"
                        key="Grand (We-tar-hoo and similar spellings) River (S.

That there were no <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs in the delegation and that the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages had not replied to the captains' proposals seemed relatively unimportant.</p>

No sooner had the captains been forced to confront <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> discontent than they heard about serious trouble between the Brulé <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

                  </ref> assaults all pointed to yet another nagging and unresolved problem. Since the last days of October, the captains had had no official contact with the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages. Those villages had never replied to the American proposals, nor had they taken any substantial part in the delegation sent to negotiate with the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> towns. As these problems began to flood in on the captains, it was essential that talks be opened with leaders at <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name> and <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>.</p>
               <p>
Those talks began on November 25, when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>, <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">René Jusseaume</name>, and <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Toussaint Charbonneau</name> rode from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> to the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages. Six additional members of the expedition took one of the pirogues up to the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>. Their destination was <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>, largest and most powerful of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> settlements. For reasons that are not clear, the American party went directly to the lodge of a <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief named the <name type="person" key="Serpent">Serpent</name>. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> seemed especially interested in talking with another chief named the <name type="person" key="Horned Weasel (Maw-pah'-pir-re-cos-satoo)">Horned Weasel</name>. Oddly, there is no record of any attempt to talk with either <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> or <name type="person" key="Cherry Grows on a Bush (Caltarcota)">Caltarcota</name>. <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Charles">Charles Mackenzie</name>, a North West Company trader living in <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name>, was told by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> that when the Americans attempted to talk with the <name type="person" key="Horned Weasel (Maw-pah'-pir-re-cos-satoo)">Horned Weasel</name> they were politely but forcefully rebuffed. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief let it be known that he was "not at home." <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> admitted to <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Mackenzie</name> that "this conduct surprised me, it being common only among your English Lords, not to be 'at home' when they did not wish to see strangers."<ref target="n0434" n="34"/> Although <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and the rest of the American party did manage to find lodging that night, they were not given the chance to present American views to any <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name> chiefs.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> did not know that while he was being cold-shouldered in <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was in the midst of entertaining at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> some of the very men <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> wanted to meet. Sometime during the day of the 25th, with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and all the interpreters away from the fort, two <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs, one of them <name type="person" key="Waukeressara">Waukeressara</name>, appeared at the expedition's quarters. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> recognized the significance of the visit, noting that the chiefs were "the first of that Nation who has Visited us Since we have been here." Handicapped by the absence of the interpreters and anxious to pay "a perticular attention" to the visitors, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was reduced to handing out some paint, a piece of lace, a handkerchief, and "some other few articles" in hopes of making a favorable impression. The captain believed that the gifts "pleased them very much" but it would take more than an assortment of presents to change <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> attitudes.<ref target="n0435" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Unaware of the events at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> and feeling rejected by the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>-proper in <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> rode over to the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa Hidatsa</name> village on the morning of November 26. Perhaps the American diplomat hoped that among <name type="person" key="Black Moccasin (Omp-se-ha-ra)">Black Moccasin's</name> people he might gain a more sympathetic hearing. Sometime during the day, after complaining to <name type="native_nation" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Mackenzie</name> about his unpleasant experiences in <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> convened a council of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa</name> chiefs. Just who attended this meeting in <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name> is not clear since the only account is from a sketchy narrative written by <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Mackenzie</name>. Certainly there were <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa Hidatsas</name> present, and it is possible that some curious <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatas</name>-proper also showed up. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> began the proceedings by trying to explain the nature and purpose of the American presence. There had been confusion on this point, and the diplomat was eager to clarify the objective of the party as exploration, not trade. But this was a minor point, or so it seemed to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>. Mainly, he promoted the twin themes of American policy toward the Indians on the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>: peace among the tribes and a villager alliance. To emphasize United States sovereignty and good will, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> distributed clothing, medals, and flags. Although some <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> took the gifts, others made a show of rejecting them. At this point several of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> gave voice to their feelings, declaring that no matter how many presents were offered, they "could not be reconciled to like these 'strangers' as they called them." The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs then complained that "had these Whites come amongst us with charitable views they would have loaded their 'Great Boat' with necessaries. It is true they have ammunition, but they prefer throwing it away idly than sparing a shot of it to a poor <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>."</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> response to these complaints was oddly inappropriate. Unlimbering his airgun, he gave a quick demonstration of its accuracy and fire power. The assembled Indians were certainly impressed with the weapon and "dreaded the magic of its owners," but <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> had hardly quieted their fears. Nor had he gained any converts for the American gospel. The complaints continued, and at last one <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief boasted that if his young warriors ever caught the Americans on the plains they would share the fate of hunted wolves. Unimpressed with either the expedition's weaponry or <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> diplomacy, the same chief insisted that there were only two sensible men in the entire American expedition, "the worker of iron and the mender of guns."</p>
               <p>
Despite these allegations and veiled threats, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> may well have thought his mission was at least partially successful. The explorer extracted a promise from some <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs not to wage war on distant peoples such as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Shoshoni.html"

                  </ref> and <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>. But such a promise was hardly binding, and no sooner had <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> let <name type="place" key="Metaharta (Metehartar) village">Metaharta</name> than the chief of the Wolves, a society of young warriors, took a party of fifty to raid the <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> also may have thought he had made some diplomatic progress because two <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs, <name type="person" key="Big Stealer (Mar-noh-tah)">Marnohtoh</name> and <name type="person"
                        key="Tail of the Calumet Bird (Man-nes-surree, Man-se-rus-se)">Mannessurree</name>, agreed to return with him to <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> for further talks.<ref target="n0436" n="36"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Once back at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, there were more talks and now some of the sources for <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> distrust of the expedition were revealed. The chiefs unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and poorly concealed abuse on the captains. The first part of that torrent concerned rumors spread by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> and designed to keep the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> from coming to trade at the fort. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chiefs claimed the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> had told them that the Americans were in league with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>
                  </ref> and were preparing a secret winter attack. This rumor was added to another <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-inspired tale which insisted that any <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> who went to the expedition's quarters would be killed by the explorers. These rumors gained weight among the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villagers as they witnessed a number of events for which there seemed no explanation except a sinister one. When <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">René Jusseaume</name> moved his family into <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, many <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> saw this as a sign of a coming attack. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> were further worried by the sheer size of <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> and its well-armed occupants. A number of chiefs were offended also at what they called "the high-sounding language the American captains bestowed upon themselves and their nation, wishing to impress the Indians with an idea that they were great warriors, and a powerful people, who, if exasperated, could crush all the nations of the earth." As <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the Younger</name> later explained, such saber rattling did not set well with the proud <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>.</p>
               <p>
Rumor, misunderstanding, and a dash of American swagger were not the only things that had alienated the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>. There was the matter of economic ties with British traders and what <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> believed to be illegal political activity by North West Company agents. The captains knew long before they got to the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> that they would encounter British citizens working for the two great trading companies. As <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> understood it, American policy was to allow such business activity by foreign nationals to continue so long as it did not threaten federal sovereignty. The explorers had made it plain in their earliest meetings with <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Charles">Mackenzie</name> and <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">François Antoine Larocque</name> that North West Company agents would not be forced out of the new lands of the Louisiana Purchase as long as they did not distribute any symbols of political authority such as flags and medals. After listening to the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas'</name> charges, the captains were convinced that <name type="person" key="Lafrance, Baptiste">Jean Baptiste La France</name>, a North West Company clerk working for <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> and <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Charles">Mackenzie</name>, was speaking "unfavorably" among the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> about American actions and intentions. There is no doubt that the Indian villagers felt close enough to the British traders to exclude American economic overtures. They did not need someone like La <name type="place" key="France">France</name> to remind them of the important role played by both the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> himself made his preferences known in a conversation with <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Charles">Charles Mackenzie</name>. The chief "said a great deal in favor of the [North West] Company, but he did not praise the Americans."</p>
               <p>
And there was one final sentiment voiced by the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> at the end of November. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> believed that an Indian policy promoting peace between the tribes was both humane and rational. Many younger <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> warriors did not share that view. They explained that forswearing raids on enemies would leave unavenged the deaths of relatives. More important, without the status gained by deeds of valor there would be no way to select village leaders. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> recorded one young warrior's concern that "if they were in a state of peace with all their neighbors what would the nation do for chiefs?" This man saw the unfortunate cultural consequences of peace, explaining that "the chiefs were now old and must shortly die and that the nation could not exist without chiefs."</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> may well have been overwhelmed by both the vehemence and the number of <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> grievances. Just how <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> answered them is not recorded in the expedition journals. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> only noted with forced optimism that "all those reports was contredicted by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> with a conviction on the minds of the Indians of the falsity of those reports." But little had really changed. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> were no more prepared to become part of the American grand design than before. All the concerns that had forced <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> mission were still unresolved. In fact, now that the captains knew just how much tension there was between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"

                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>

               </p>
               <p>
Determined to do whatever they could to preserve a policy toward the Indians that now seemed on the verge of complete collapse, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and  decided to call in the Nor'Wester <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> for a severe tongue-lashing. Unable to change Indian realities, the captains evidently fixed on the Nor'Westers as the source of the expedition's difficulties. Although <name type="place" key="Lafrance, Baptiste">La France</name> had probably done all he could to keep the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> loyal to their North West Company partners and <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> had sometimes made a nuisance of himself in pressing his request to accompany the Americans to the <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had no real evidence to suggest that British traders were inciting opposition to American authority. Nonetheless, on November 28 the captains met with <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> and other <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs for "a little talk on the Subject of the British Trader <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">M. Le rock</name> Giveing meadals and Flags." The chiefs were told that if they accepted such gifts they would "incur the displeasure of their Great American Father."<ref target="n0438" n="38"/>
               </p>
               <p>
With the Indians properly warned, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> turned directly to <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name>. On the following day the trader and one of his men came to <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> just as a soldier in the expedition was setting out to summon him. <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> was treated well enough; in fact, relations between the traders and the explorers were to remain genial during most of the winter. There was a good deal of mutual visiting between the two groups and the captains found men like <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name>, <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Charles">Mackenzie</name>, and <name type="person" key="Heney, Hugh">Hugh Heney</name> to be valuable sources of information on a wide variety of subjects. But now the tension of the past several weeks began to show as <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> accused <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> of intending to distribute medals and flags. He quickly replied that, in failing to carry such objects with him, he "ran no risk of disobeying" their orders. Apparently put off by that disclaimer, the captains then brought <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name> into the discussion. <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>, with the expedition's permission, had been working part-time for <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> in the trade with the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>. <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name> was "strictly enjoined not to utter a word to the Indians which might in any way be to the prejudice of the United States, or any of its citizens," even if <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> ordered him to do so. Turning to <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larcoque</name>, one of the captains added sarcastically, "Which we are very far from thinking you would." The air temporarily cleared, the explorers and traders spent a pleasant evening at the fort. <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> was told about American trade policy on the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and the extension of the factory system into the region. "In short," recalled <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name>, "during the time I was there a very grand plan was schemed, but its being realized is more than I can tell, although the Captains say they are well assured it will."<ref target="n0439" n="39"/>

Nothing of substance had changed. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> may have felt confident about <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque's</name> "fair promises," but the fundamental problems undermining that "very grand plan" were no nearer resolution. All the fears and concerns that drove <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> to make his ill-fated journey to the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> towns had not gone away. Like virtually all white diplomats on the North American frontier, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> found it difficult to believe that they could not easily rearrange Indian realities to serve non-Indian interests. The captains were not the masters of Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> Indian affairs. They were simply players in a complex game made more intricate by their very presence. Just how helpless the expedition was to shape native actions became painfully clear at the end of November.</p>

Friday morning, November 30, seemed like the beginning of any other routine day at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. There had been a hard frost overnight and now hut fires were stoked up to beat back the cold. At eight o'clock the quiet was broken by a voice shouting from the other side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. A <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> called for a pirogue to ferry him across the river, explaining he had "something of consequence to communicate." Once in the fort, the Indian presented the captains with news that alarmed them and at the same time offered a unique opportunity for the expedition to flex its military muscle. He explained that five <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> hunters had been surprised and attacked by a party of <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> warriors. In the struggle that followed one villager was killed, two were wounded, and nine horses were stolen. There had also been trouble between the raiders and hunters from <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name>. Four <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> from that village were missing and rumors were flying of an imminent <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

"We thought it well," explained <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, "to Show a Disposition to ade and assist them against their enemies, perticularly those who Came in oppersition to our Councels." After a hurried discussion, the captains organized a large armed party of soldiers from the fort. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expected to swell their own ranks by obtaining volunteers from <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>, <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>, and <name type="place" key="Mahawha (Marharha) village">Mahawha</name>.</p>
               <p>
By midmorning <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had his men ready for action. The putative expedition consisted of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name>, and about twenty soldiers. Crossing the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, the group headed for the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village of <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>. Once across the river, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> arrayed his troops in battle formation with men out on each flank and a covering rear guard. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant Ordway</name>, who was on the left flank, recalled later that heavy brush matted down with snow made the march slow and difficult. Finally making their way out of the river bottom, the Americans broke onto the level plain behind <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had planned the show of force as a means to impress and reassure the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"

"The Indians not expected to receive Such Strong aide in So Short a time was much surprised, and a little allarmed at the formadable appearence of my party." When <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and his men were about two hundred yards from the village, a very worried <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> and several other chiefs came out and nervously invited the Americans into the town.

Turning to <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>, who was evidently in <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> or other business, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> asked him to verify the assault on the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> hunters. This done, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> then recommended that war parties from both <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages join the American forces "to meet the Army of <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Souex</name> and chastise them for taking the blood of our Dutiful Children."</p>
               <p>
If the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs were alarmed by the arrival of heavily armed soldiers, they were astounded at <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> proposal.

The dead man could be avenged in the spring. Clearly the chiefs found the American suggestions both puzzling and disturbing. After a brief talk among themselves, <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> explained that all the villagers were impressed with the readiness of the Americans to defend them. Trying to accept some of the blame for the attack and thereby defuse the situation, the chief said that his people "carelessly went out to hunt in small parties believing themselves to be safe from the other nations." Although <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> tended to portray the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> as the instigators in this and other attacks, <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> saved his harshest words for the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>. Recalling the discussion of the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> truce at the meetings in late October, <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> revealed for the first time his harsh words directed at the visiting Indian diplomat. "I knew," insisted the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief, "that the <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Panies</name> [<name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>] were liers, and told the old Chief who Came with you (to Confirm a peace with us) that his people were liers and bad men and that we killed them like the Buffalo, when we pleased." <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name> again expressed the common <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> view that any peace with the aggressive <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> was bound to be unstable. He added that two <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> men who had been in <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> at the time of the raid were sent packing by the chiefs for fear that revenge might be taken on them. According to <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name>, those visitors reported that two of the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> towns "were making their Mockersons," a sure sign of preparation for war, and that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"

Even so, the prospect of rushing out to "chastise" the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name> in the dead of a <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name> winter had little appeal to any of the villagers. "My father," said <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man</name>, "the Snow is deep and it is cold, our horses Cannot travel through the plains, those people who have spilt our blood have gone back."

The journey back in failing light and deep snow proved to be "verry fatigueing." To boost their spirits once inside the fort, each man was given an extra liquor ration.

The day must have been an unsettling climax to a troubled month. At the end of October, with the initial <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> councils finished, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had believed they were well on the way to achieving their Indian policy goals. Then the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> peace seemed assured and unity among the village peoples appeared probable. But events throughout November challenged those assumptions. The captains' best efforts to salvage something of their plans failed. Their response to the attack on the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> hunters was symbolic of how little white outsiders could alter Indian realities. Held prisoner by their own political and cultural values, the captains were determined to use the incident as an excuse for the display of their military might and, with some luck, to strike a blow against the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
                  <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"

                  </ref>. Differing perspectives on warfare and diplomacy meant that the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs found the American desire for winter revenge at best baffling and at worst stupid. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> unhappy <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> foray could now be matched by an equally fruitless <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> journey into the complicated Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> Indian world.</p>
               <p>
As the snow and cold of a <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name> December closed in, the captains found more of their time taken up with the demands of food, warm clothing, and reliable fires. They had no intention of ignoring the uneasy state of Indian affairs around them, but travel conditions and lack of sufficient information narrowed their options and limited what actions could be taken. Believing that the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs had been both impressed and reassured, they had only to discover the current state of <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>

The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> winter was neither all high diplomacy nor a nerve-racking round of alarms and confusions. Most of the five months spent at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> were taken up with demands for food and shelter. Explorers and Indians got to know each other in ways that had little to do with federal policy or grand councils. Visiting, hunting, trading, and sexual adventures were all common ground where people from different cultures could talk, joke, haggle, and compete in the shared struggle for life on the northern plains.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> was no isolated frontier outpost, caught in the grip of a <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name> winter and cut off from the simple pleasures of human companionship. Long before <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> came to the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villagers had brightened their winters with a steady round of visits to the lodges of friends and neighbors. Life in the winter camps could be harsh and hungry, but there also were times for storytelling and gossip. Once <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> was built, the Americans simply became part of that social web that bound the villagers together. Nothing seemed more natural than the desire of explorer and Indian alike to see each other at home and share some food and friendship.</p>
               <p>
From the moment the expedition reached its winter quarters, Indian visitors came in a steady stream. Fascinated by the "great boat," the endless variety of curious objects, and the Americans themselves, village men, women, and especially children, could not get enough close looks at the bearded strangers. Although some Indians came to trade, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> remarked later in the winter that most were "lookers on" simply attracted by the presence of the expedition.<ref target="n0442" n="42"/> By the end of the councils in late October, any initial reserve each group had about the other was gone. When <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> returned on October 30 from a trip upriver looking for a suitable fort location, he found his men gaily dancing sets and reels, "which pleased the savages much."<ref target="n0443" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Once the expedition's workmen began to build <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, there was even more reason for Indians to come down and watch the construction of a great lodge the size and shape of which they had never seen. Just how much good-natured banter was possible between Indian onlookers and American workers is not part of the expedition's record, but throughout November there was hardly a day in which numbers of Indians did not come to inspect the construction.<ref target="n0444" n="44"/> By the end of the month, as the fort took shape, it was possible for the explorers to invite selected Indian visitors—usually chiefs, elders, and their families—into their rooms. On November 20, for example, three chiefs from <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name> paid a visit, stayed all day, and were "verry Curious in examining our works."<ref target="n0445" n="45"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Indians were drawn not only to the fort itself but to the many "curiosities" they found inside. It had long been the expedition's practice to display all sorts of weapons and scientific instruments to Indians in an effort to impress them with American technology. When <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> and other <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> came to the fort in early March 1805, they were shown everything from <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> airgun to his spyglass. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> promptly proclaimed these devices to be "Great Medicines." Whether impressed or not, many visitors found the objects both mysterious and compelling. Thermometers, quadrants, writing paper, and metal objects of all sorts were worth a special trip. It was as if <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

During most of the winter, Indians were welcomed at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> with unfailing hospitality. Only once during the entire season were Indians asked not to visit the fort. On Christmas Day, 1804, the expedition wanted to do its own celebrating. Native neighbors were told that the festivities were part of a special "medicine day" for whites only. On every other day the gates were open. When a group of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Cheyenne.html"

When meat became very scarce in mid-January, many Indians came to the fort hoping to be fed. Although the expedition was not any better supplied than the villagers, <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> reported that "we use them as well as possible."<ref target="n0447" n="47"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Indian visitors brought to the expedition's huts a sense of friendship and "good company." Visits from Indian neighbors usually meant sharing food and enjoying a dance or some fiddle music by <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</name>. There must have been time to appreciate a fine bow, a good gun, or a skillfully decorated pair of moccasins. Older men like <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> often told what <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> described as "Indian aneckdotes." Although none of those stories was set down in their journals, the Americans may have heard the sorts of stories and tales told in lodges among friends.<ref target="n0448" n="48"/>
               </p>
               <p>
The sheer numbers of that company sometimes tested patience on both sides of the cultural divide. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> called the Indians "good company" and in the same breath complained that "they usually pester us the ballance of the day after once being introduced to our apartment." <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> peevishly recalled that on one day in mid-December he had fourteen Indians all eating in his squad room at the same time. On another occasion, when the weather suddenly turned warm at the end of December, "great numbers of indians of all discriptions Came to the fort." In fact, there were so many visitors during the day that <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> complained, "We found them troublesome in our huts." Misunderstandings were inevitable. When an Indian did something to annoy <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</name>, the soldier struck the man on his hand with a spoon.<ref target="n0449" n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Despite the tensions that would naturally come when people meet each other at close quarters, the daily round of Indian visitors was a welcome part of the <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

Later, at <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name> on the <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>, the captains would feel compelled to issue strict regulations controlling the presence of Indians inside the palisade. The <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> rules were much looser. The only serious attempt at limiting native guests came in early February when the sergeant of the guard discovered that women belonging to the <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name> and <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> households "were in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any time of night and admitting their Indian visitors."

Social calling was a two-way affair during the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>. Members of the expedition managed to make frequent trips to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages. Those trips were usually for trade and occasionally for personal affairs, but some were simply for good company. When <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and a friend went up to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> towns during a break in the January weather, they were given a warm welcome and plenty to eat. These visits were a regular part of the explorers' lives during an otherwise difficult winter.</p>
               <p>
Perhaps the grandest, and certainly the loudest, visit paid by the expedition to the Indian towns was in celebration of New Year's Day, 1805. Both English and French traditions called for a boisterous, joyful romp to usher in the new year. On January 1, after firing two swivel guns to mark the occasion, the captains allowed sixteen men "with their Musick" to visit <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> "for the purpose of Dancing." The merry men of the expedition had told <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> that their visit was made at "the perticular request of the Chiefs of that Village." Led by <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name>, the party left the fort carrying a fiddle, a tambourine, and a sounding horn. At the entrance to <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> the Americans fired their weapons and played a brisk tune. Welcomed into the village, they marched to the central plaza, fired another round, and began to dance. The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> onlookers were especially charmed by the ability of <name type="person" key="Rivet, François">François Rivet</name> to dance upside down on his hands. All joined in a circle around <name type="person" key="Rivet, François">Rivet</name>, dancing and singing. After some time all the revelers were invited into the lodges for food and gifts of buffalo robes.</p>
               <p>
Toward noon <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> appeared with <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name>, and a third man. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> walk up to <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> combined pleasure and diplomacy. "My views," he explained, "were to alay Some little Miss understanding which had taken place Thro jelloucy and mortification as to our treatment of them." When <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> arrived at the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> town, he found the festivities in full swing. To add to the merriment, he called on <name type="person" key="York">York</name> to dance, "which amused the crowd very much, and somewhat astonished them, that so large a man should be active." As the good times continued throughout the afternoon, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> visited the lodges of all except two of <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka's</name> leading men. Those who did not merit a holiday greeting were guilty, so <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> charged, of "some expressions not favorable towards us, in comparing us with the traders from the north."

                  </ref> reassured the captains that the remarks were made "in jest and laftur." Late in the afternoon the eating and dancing finally played out and most of the men in the expedition went back to <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>.

               </p>
               <p>
One day of New Year's celebrating simply led to another, and with a second <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village nearby, no one needed any more reason to make a second round of holiday cheer. This time it was <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> turn. Along with <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, the captain and most of the garrison went out on January 2 toward <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>. At the village there was more of what <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> described as "frolicking." Eating, dancing, and a general good time were enjoyed by soldiers and villagers alike.<ref target="n0452" n="52"/>
               </p>
               <p>
The expedition and its Indian neighbors were drawn to each other not only by the shared desire for friendship but by the needs of business and trade. The explorers had an insatiable appetite for <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> corn and other produce. The kills made by expeditionary hunters had to be supplemented by buffalo and antelope brought by Indians. Filling the larders of <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> brought Indian suppliers and white consumers together to haggle over what a basket of corn was worth and just how many hoes could be mended for a side of buffalo.</p>
               <p>
Although Indians occasionally brought food to the fort as a gift, the expedition learned early in its stay that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> were skilled traders who expected good measure for their crops. At the end of October, just as the Americans were establishing winter quarters, <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> women began to bring corn and cornbread into camp. As <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> observed, "They expect us to give them some small article in return for their produce."<ref target="n0453" n="53"/> As winter drew on and word spread that the fort was a good market for food products, a steady stream of Indian men and women came to trade. In one typical exchange, <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Little Raven</name> and his wife brought a quantity of corn meal and were given some dried buffalo meat, a pot, and an axe. On another occasion <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> had his wife pack down one hundred pounds of buffalo, which was exchanged for "some small presents to the squar and [the] child [received] a small axe [with] which she was very much pleased." There is no evidence that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> ever worked out a uniform price and exchange schedule in which certain amounts of corn or meat would automatically receive a set quantity of trade goods or blacksmith services. Rather, it appears that each purchase was bargained on the spot. The captains were willing to barter almost anything in their store of goods in order to maintain a steady supply of food. However, they refused to trade in firearms. When an old man came looking for a pistol in return for some corn and four buffalo robes, his offer was firmly rejected.<ref target="n0454" n="54"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Because the expedition so desperately needed Indian corn and the captains knew that there was a tremendous demand among the natives for metal goods, an interesting exchange system gradually developed between <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> and the nearby villages. That system involved Indians bringing corn as payment for blacksmith work done at the <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> forge. Under the direction of <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>, a skilled smith, the expedition's force and bellows were put in place at the end of December. Iron hoes were mended, firearms were repaired, and later a brisk business was done fabricating battle axes. Indian visitors to the fort were "much surprized" by workings of the machinery and once the captains let them know of the new arrangement for trade, corn supplies quickly increased.<ref target="n0455" n="55"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Until late January 1805, this system seemed to work well. Indians got hoes mended and axes sharpened while the expedition maintained a dependable store of provisions. But this exchange economy had a curious flaw. There were only so many hoes in need of repair and only a limited number of dull axes. By the end of January, the blacksmith-corn trade stood in danger of shutting down for want of Indian interest. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> then shrewdly analyzed the requirements of their Indian customers. Despite the fact that intertribal peace was a mainstay of the expedition's diplomacy, the captains decided to enter the weapons business. Their plan was both to manufacture and to repair war axes, a weapon much in demand by Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> warriors. This new aspects of expedition-Indian trade demanded an expansion of <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan's</name> industrial capacity. More charcoal was needed for the forge, and on January 24 work parties were detailed to begin cutting timber. Several days later prairie grass was cut to cover a makeshift charcoal kiln. By January 29 <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> reported, "We are burning a large Coal pit to mend Indians hatchets, and to make war axes." The captain readily admitted that the weapons trade was vital for the expedition's survival, noting it was "the only means by which we procure corn from them."<ref target="n0456" n="56"/>
               </p>
               <p>
For the rest of the winter the smiths were busy filling Indian orders for war axes. When the forge ran far behind on orders, an old burned-out stove was salvaged and cut up to make arrow points and buffalohide scrapers. Because unworked metal was so scarce at this point, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> established a short-term exchange schedule. The smiths were to charge seven or eight gallons of corn for each four-inch piece of sheet iron. Just how important this trade had become was plain when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> wrote that "the blacksmiths have proved a happy resource to us in our present situation as I believe it would have been difficult to have devised any other method to have procured corn from the natives." As the winter began to break in March and warriors started to talk about the spring raids, the pace of war axe production increased. By March 13, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> observed, "Many Indians here today all anxiety for war axes the smiths have not an hour of idle time to spare." Because the captains had so often emphasized the American desire to end intertribal wars, arming warriors with weapons made at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> put the explorer-diplomats in an odd position. The captains never intended to fuel the fires of raid and ambush, but neither were they so naive as to think that the "impliments of War" from the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> forge were for defensive purposes only. Typical of this dilemma was the request from a <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name> war chief who came to purchase an axe and obtain permission to attack <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>
                  </ref> and <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> warriors. For the proper price in corn the axe was handed over, but the request to use it was denied. The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief must have wondered just what sort of man would arm a warrior and then tell him not to engage the enemy. The war axes were prized possessions and some ended up being traded with other Indians for equally desirable goods. How far those products of the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> forge traveled was discovered some fourteen months later when the expedition, on its way home, stopped at the Pahmap <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_NezPerce.html"

               </p>
               <p>
If trading brought explorers and Indians closer together as business partners, those same transactions provide modern students of Indian-European relations with some valuable evidence about how each culture saw the other. The men of the expedition were often bewildered by watching the Indians bring in valuable food supplies in exchange for what seemed worthless bits of metal and fabric. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> insisted that <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> men and women were eager to have "old shirts, buttons, awls, knives, and the like articles." Other journalists in the party, as well as many early traders, agreed with that evaluation.<ref target="n0458" n="58"/> It was equally true that Indians wondered why whites were so ready to part with precious metal goods for corn that could be grown every year. Neither group fully realized that cultures value objects and goods differently, depending on the needs and circumstances of that particular culture. A classic case of the differing perspectives on material culture was the use made by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> of a corn mill given to them by the expedition during the winter. Although the Indians were fascinated by the device, they had no use for it in its present state. On the other hand, the metal in the grinder was a scarce and valuable commodity to be made into arrow points and hide scrapers. The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> promptly dismantled the mill to serve their own cultural needs. The largest piece was attached to a wooden handle and what emerged was a fine pounder for making grease from buffalo marrow bones. When <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the Younger</name> saw the skillful transformation of the corn mill, he quickly labeled the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> mechanics "foolish fellows."<ref target="n0459" n="59"/>
               </p>
               <p>
But the Indian interest in European goods of all kinds was more than a matter of obtaining the fruits of western iron technology. Native peoples throughout North America often saw European goods as something more than just material objects. This was especially the case with guns, peace medals, Christian missionary relics, and coins. Those things were venerated as both symbols and transmitters of the strong medicine and spiritual energy the whites seemed to possess. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> had some inkling of this when he wrote in 1807 that the Indians believed the first white traders "were the most powerful persons in the nation."<ref target="n0460" n="60"/> The power of the whites could be shared with others by wearing or using things associated with them. Some <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>-proper villagers gave voice to that belief when they claimed that the gifts, flags, and silver medals distributed by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> contained powerful evil forces that reflected the dangerous intent of the expedition. Fearing the "bad medicine" in the objects, the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name> thought the best thing to be done with such hazardous goods was to pawn them off on unsuspecting enemies.<ref target="n0461" n="61"/> Just as white Americans a century and a half later would prize bits of pottery and arrow points as reminders of a distant and mysterious native past, so <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> men and women valued buttons and tobacco boxes as links, for good or ill, to powerful strangers.</p>
               <p>
Although visiting and trading were important parts of life shared by Indians and explorers during the long winter months, few activities bound the men of the fort to the villagers as did hunting. Both cultures valued the hunter for his skill in a dangerous pursuit. Throughout the winter there were many joint hunting parties. Those trips, often in bitter cold and through deep snow, served to increase the sense of sharing a common life on the plains.</p>
               <p>
One such hunting venture took place in early December. When buffalo were discovered nearby, <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name> sent word to the fort and invited the expedition to join the chase. Always ready to replenish their food stores, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, and fourteen other men gathered with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref> for the hunt. The explorers watched with admiration as the mounted Indian hunters guided the buffalo herd away from broken ground and on to a level plain where each man cut out an animal for the kill. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his men were able to kill ten buffalo, five of which were packed back to the fort. The remaining dead animals were, according to plains custom, available for any hunter to butcher and take along. On the second day of the hunt, as the temperature fell to -12°F, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> joined the chase. The expedition's guns brought down several more buffalo, but the harsh cold and broken ground extracted a high price for the meat. Several of the hunters had frostbitten feet, two men had badly bruised hips from falling on hard ground, and <name type="person" key="York">York</name> had a frostbitten penis. This rigorous two-day adventure added food to <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> larders and surely impressed the explorers with the Indians' hunting skills. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> certainly understood the physical requirements of the winter buffalo hunt when he admitted he "felt a little fatigued haveing run after the Buffalow all day in Snow many Places 18 inches Deep, generally 6 or 8." It was that kind of understanding that made hunters from both cultures value and appreciate each other.<ref target="n0462" n="62"/>
               </p>
               <p>
The need for medical attention was yet another force that brought Indians and explorers together during that winter. Native doctoring focused on the healing of cuts, bruises, and abrasions. Because the captains had the reputation as powerful spirit beings, some Indians believed that white medical techniques might be especially effective in serious cases. At the end of December, for example, a woman brought her child who was suffering from a severe abscess on the lower back. Anxious to obtain "some medisin," the worried mother promised "as much corn as she could carry" as payment. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> laconically wrote that "<name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> administered," but his method of treatment and the outcome were not recorded. Perhaps the most serious Indian case the captains dealt with involved the young adopted son of a <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name> family. At temperatures around -40°F, the young boy had wandered away from the village and had spent the night on the prairie protected only by a buffalo robe. When the boy was found, his feet were severely frostbitten.

The young Americans were looking for something to soften the rigors of a <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name> winter, and the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> women were willing for the same reasons as their <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> sisters. There is little doubt that the explorers found village women attractive. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> noted after the first <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> meeting that the Indians "had Some handsome women with them."<ref target="n0464" n="64"/> He became involved in <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan's</name> first troublesome sexual affair. One morning, toward the end of November, the sentry on duty reported that an Indian was about to kill his wife. Hoping to stop such a violent act, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> went outside the fort for a talk with the angry husband. From the conversation came a complex tale of sexual jealousy. About eight days before, the Indian couple had had a bitter argument and the woman had left the village and spent several days with the <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name> and <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jusseaume</name> women. After a cooling-off-period, the Indian woman had returned to her husband only to have the quarrel flare up again. Beaten and stabbed three times, the terrified woman fled once again to the safety of <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and her sisters. When <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> tried to quiet the angry husband, the captain was told that <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> was somehow involved in the nasty business. The Indian claimed that <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> had slept with his wife, and "if he wanted her he would give her to him." <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> then ordered <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> to give the irate man some trade goods to soothe his ruffled feathers. But at the same time, the captain chided the Indian, saying that "not one man of this party had touched his wife except the one he had given the use of her for a nite, in his own bed." Tacitly admitting that there was a good deal of intercourse between his men and the village women, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> claimed that they would not "touch a woman if they knew her to be the wife of another man." Exactly how <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> knew the means used to select only unmarried bed partners is unknown, but perhaps believing that <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> soldiers only slept with single women eased his conscience. In this particular case, the captain ordered that "no man of this party have any intercourse with this woman under penalty of Punishment." As for the unhappy Indian couple, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> played marriage counselor and advised the pair to go home and "live happily together in the future."<ref target="n0465" n="65"/>

Although not usually so violent as the <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> affair, sexual liaisons were an accepted part of <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> life. Regular visits to nearby villages and the large number of women who frequented the fort offered the opportunities sought by both sexes. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> knew well in advance of their departure from <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> that sexual relations would be part of the expedition's experience. Understandably, they included the sorts of medical instruments and remedies believed effective against venereal diseases. Symptoms of venereal complaints were first recorded in mid-January 1805. By the end of the month at least one in the party was "very bad with the pox." As the explorers were preparing to leave <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> at the end of the winter, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> made yet another revealing statement about the widespread incidence of sex with Indian women and its medical consequences.

Most sexual affairs during the winter were private matters that satisfied the personal needs of the different partners. But there was one <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> ceremony that involved sexual relations far beyond the personal and the private. The buffalo-calling or walking ritual involved younger men offering their wives to elderly warriors and hunters for sexual intercourse. Essential to the rite was the belief that power, in this case the hunting abilities of old men, could be transferred from one person to another by sexual relations. Buffalo calling was not simply to lure a herd close to the village but also a means of giving young men special skill in the chase. White males were also sought after as sources for great power. As <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> himself noted, "The Indians say all white flesh is medisan." The <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> agreed, saying that "the white men are powerful, they are like magic." Just how many men in the expedition obligingly took part in the ritual is unknown, but the trader <name type="person" key="Tabeau, Pierre-Antoine">Tabeau</name> reported that many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html"

                  </ref> attack on <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> and the surrounding villages cannot be known. There was no doubt that many <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> saw <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> as a dangerous force. The Americans had challenged <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name> economic power, threatened by the important <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name> connection, and were attempting to forge a military and commercial alliance against the nomads. There was surely sufficient reason for any number of war parties to move against the expedition. But there is no evidence that such a move was planned by any of the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name> bands. For all the talk of a spring massacre, the captains did not appear to take <name type="person" key="Gravelines, Joseph">Gravelines'</name> warning seriously. It may have been that by the end of the winter the diplomatic education of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was sufficiently advanced so that they knew something about the difference between rumor and reality. More likely, their knowledge that they would leave the region in early spring made the threat less menacing.</p>
               <p>
March was the last full month the expedition spent at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. To the daily routine of trading, hunting, and tending the hut fires were now added the time-consuming preparations for the second year of western travel. Canoe builders were busy making four craft while others were checking ropes, clothing, and vital hardware. Ice breaking up in the river and the return of biting gnats were sure signs of spring and the time of departure.</p>
               <p>
Preparations were interrupted early in March by the arrival of a <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> delegation. On a cold, windy March morning, as <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> walked up to inspect the canoe builders, he met the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>-proper chief <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">La Borgne</name>. The chief was surely the most influential of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> village leaders, and his apparent refusal to parley with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> throughout the winter was a real defeat for their diplomacy. <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> had made no attempt to hide his disdain for the captains. <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name> had reported earlier in the year <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne's</name> barbed sarcasm aimed at the explorers.

               <p>
That remark seemed to justify the impression most white travelers on the Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> had about the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief. <name type="person" key="Brackenridge, H. M.">Henry M. Brackenridge</name>, calling <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> "one of the most extraordinary men I ever knew," described the chief as "sometimes a cruel and abominable tyrant" who ruled with "unlimited control." <name type="person" key="Brackenridge, H. M.">Brackenridge's</name> fellow traveler John Bradbury agreed. The English naturalist used words like "monster," "savage" and "ferocious" to portray <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name>. Tales relating <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne's</name> violence and strength gained wide currency in the region; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> told <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name> one such story about the chief's murder of a faithless wife. While <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> was unquestionably a man of personal strength and ability, he was neither the tyrant nor the brute presented in the records of those who actually saw little or nothing of him. <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the Younger</name> did have much experience with <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> and this trader's observations suggest a very different sort of man. Now in his mid-forties, the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief had become a skilled warrior and astute diplomat.

Although it is now unclear what sort of calculation brought <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> to <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> on March 9, 1805, it was a move the chief would not have taken without careful thought. Because <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> spent much of the day with the canoe builders and later at <name type="place" key="Ruptáre (Rooptahee) village">Rooptahee</name>, just what passed between <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> is unknown. It is certainly plain that the chief was shown all the respect due his position and was showered with gifts. Hearing that <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> had not received the presents sent to him after the October 1804 meetings, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> made a special point to offer a wide variety of goods, including a shirt, some scarlet cloth, a flag, and a metal gorget. To impress the chief with western technology, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> brought out the airgun, the quadrant, and a spyglass, all of which <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> pronounced "Great Medicines." Perhaps the most charming moment of the day came when <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> spotted York standing nearby. The chief had heard about <name type="person" key="York">York's</name> blackness from young warriors. Doubting what they had seen, the chief called for <name type="person" key="York">York</name> to be brought to him. Thinking that perhaps <name type="person" key="York">York's</name> color was paint, <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> spit on his own hand and vigorously rubbed <name type="person" key="York">York's</name> skin. When <name type="person" key="York">York</name> removed the handkerchief from his head and showed <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> his hair, the chief was astonished and promptly declared that the black man "was of a different species from the whites."</p>
               <p>
The meeting with <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> must have seemed strangely anticlimatic. So much had happened over the winter that made the captains need the support or at least the understanding of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> chief. But on the vital questions of Upper <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> diplomacy the expedition's record for March 9 is strangely silent. If <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> broached the subject of a villager alliance and trade with <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, perhaps <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> showed no interest in pursuing such matters. Whatever his feelings, <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name> made no promises. The two swivel guns fired in his honor at the end of the meeting signaled nothing except the failure of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> diplomacy to change <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> minds.<ref target="n0475" n="75"/>

When the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> winter was nearly over, two incidents occurred that symbolized the experience of that season for both the expedition and its Indian neighbors. Toward the end of March, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> heard that two <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> war parties had left the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name> villages and a third was soon to depart.

Had the expedition's diplomats carefully checked <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> weapons, they might have been even more dismayed. Many of their war axes probably bore the marks of having been made at the <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

Tensions between <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villagers were certain to flare up once American traders came from <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>.

               <p>
But if <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> diplomacy produced few if any of the changes sought by the explorers, it would be misleading to declare the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> winter either a failure or a disappointment. In many ways the months at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> were both productive and peaceful. During the 1805–1806 winter at <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, surrounded by dampness and subjected to an unending fare of foul elk meat and dried salmon, many in the party would recall the bracing plains climate and tasty diet with considerable nostalgia. Personal relations between explorers and villagers during the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> winter were marked by genuine good feeling with only few misunderstandings. Those friendships made it possible for the expedition to spend a winter on the plains with a sense of security unrivaled in the history of North American exploration. That sense of harmony, security, and good spirits can be felt in the last visit <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> paid to <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name> on an unseasonably warm day in early April. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> smoked with the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief "as is their custom," and when <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> arrived the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> presented him with a pair of beautifully decorated moccasins. If the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> war parties were an unpleasant reminder of unachieved goals, those moccasins symbolized what good neighbors both peoples had been. The simple rituals of hunting, eating, trading, and sleeping together had bound the explorers and villagers together during a <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name> winter.
