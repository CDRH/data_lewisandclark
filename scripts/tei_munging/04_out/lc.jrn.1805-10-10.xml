In passing over one a canoe sprung a leak, but did not sink; though the greater part of the loading was wet; and we had to halt and dry it. We stopped a short distance above the junction of this with another large river.

About a mile below the confluence we halted on the north side and encamped<ref target="n22101022" n="22"/> for the night, as the wind blew so hard we could not proceed. We came 20 miles to day.
