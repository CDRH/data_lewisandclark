Monday Febry 3rd    We had a little frost, &amp; the weather has moderated since Yesterday.    About noon two of our hunters came to the fort from hunting.    they informed us that they had killed 7 Elk &amp; caught 1 Large beaver.    Six of our Men set out with a Canoe to go after the Elk meat, but soon returned the wind being too high for them to proceed, down to the Bay.    In the evening they attempted it again, but the tide was so low that they could not get near the Shore, for the sholes &amp; sand Barrs.    five men came in from the <name type="place" key="Saltmaking Camp (Oreg.)">Salt camp</name>, with 2 bushels of Salt &amp; the flesh of part a whale which we found tolerably good eating.—    The natives call the whale meat E-Co-ley.—
