My friend <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> was very sick all last night but feels himself somewhat better this morning since his medicine has opperated.<ref target="n18072801" n="1"/> I dispatched two men early this morning up the <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">S. E. Fork</name> to examine the river; and permitted sundry others to hunt in the neighbourhood of this place. Both <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> and myself corrisponded in opinion with rispect to the impropriety of calling either of these streams the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and accordingly agreed to name them after the President of the United States and the Secretaries of the Treasury and state having previously named one river in honour of the Secretaries of War and Navy. In pursuance of this resolution we called the <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">S. W. fork</name>, that which we meant to ascend, <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson's River</name> in honor of 〈that illustrious personage〉 <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</name>. [<hi rend="italic">NB?: the author of our enterprise,</hi>]<ref target="n18072802" n="2"/>    the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Middle fork</name> we called <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madison's River</name> in honor of <name type="person" key="Madison, James">James Madison</name>, and the <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">S. E. Fork</name> we called <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">Gallitin's River</name> in honor of <name type="person" key="Gallatin, Albert">Albert Gallitin</name>.<ref target="n18072803" n="3"/>    the two first are 90 yards wide and the last is 70 yards.    all of them run with great valocity and thow out large bodies of water. <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">Gallitin's River</name> is reather more rapid than either of the others, is not quite as deep but from all appearances may be navigated to a considerable distance. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> who came down <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madison's river</name> yesterday and has also seen <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson's</name> some distance thinks <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madison's</name> reather the most rapid, but it is not as much so by any means as <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">Gallitan's</name>.    the beds of all these streams are formed of smooth pebble and gravel,<ref target="n18072804" n="4"/> and their waters perfectly transparent; in short they are three noble streams.    there is timber enough here to support an establishment,<ref target="n18072805" n="5"/> provided it be erected with brick or stone either of which would be much cheaper than wood as all the materials for such a work are immediately at the spot.    there are several small sand-bars along the shores at no great distance of very pure sand and the earth appears as if it would make good brick.<ref target="n18072806" n="6"/> I had all our baggage spread out to dry this morning; and the day proving warm, I had a small bower or booth erected for the comfort of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>    our leather lodge when exposed to the sun is excessively hot. I observe large quantities of the sand rush in these bottoms which grow in many places as high as a man's breast and stand as thick as the stalks of wheat usually do. this affords one of the best winter pastures on earth for horses or cows, and of course will be much in favour of an establishment should it ever be thought necessary to fix one at this place.    the grass is also luxouriant and would afford a fine swarth of hay at this time in parsels of ma[n]y acres together.<ref target="n18072807" n="7"/>    all those who are not hunting altho' much fatiegued are busily engaged in dressing their skins, making mockersons lexing [leggings] &amp;c to make themselves comfortable.    the Musquetoes are more than usually troublesome, the knats are not as much so.<ref target="n18072808" n="8"/>    in the evening about 4 O'Ck the wind blew hard from South West and after some little time brought on a Cloud attended with thunder and Lightning from which we had a fine refreshing shower which cooled the air considerably; the showers continued with short intervals untill after dark.    in the evening the hunters all returned they had killed 8 deer and 2 Elk.    some of the deer wer in excellent order.    those whome I had sent up <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">Gallitin's river</name> reported that after it passed the point to which I had seen it yesterday that it turned more to the East to a considerable distance or as far as they could discover the opening of the Mountains formed by it's valley which was many miles.    the bottoms were tolerably wide but not as much so as at or near it's mouth.    it's current is rappid and the stream much divided with islands but is sufficiently deep for canoe navigation. Our present camp is precisely on the spot that the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake</name> Indians were encamped at the time the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name> of the <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife R.</name> first came in sight of them five years since.    from hence they retreated about three miles up <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jeffersons river</name> and concealed themselves in the woods, the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name> pursued, attacked them, killed 4 men 4 women a number of boys, and mad prisoners of all the females and four boys, <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi> or Indian woman was one of the female prisoners taken at that time; tho' I cannot discover that she shews any immotion of sorrow in recollecting this events, or of joy in being again restored to her native country; if she has enough to eat and a few trinkets to wear I believe she would be perfectly content anywhere.—</p>
