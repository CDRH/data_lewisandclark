The party that were ordered last evening set out early this morning. the weather was fair and could wind N. W.    about five oclock this evening one of the wives of <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> was delivered of a fine boy.<ref target="n09021101" n="1"/>    it is worthy of remark that this was the first child which this woman had boarn and as is common in such cases her labour was tedious and the pain violent; <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Mr. Jessome</name> informed me that he had freequently adminstered a small portion of the rattle of the rattle-snake, which he assured me had never failed to produce the desired effect, that of hastening the birth of the child; having the rattle of a snake by me I gave it to him and he administered two rings of it to the woman broken in small pieces with the fingers and added to a small quantity of water. Whether this medicine was truly the cause or not I shall not undertake to determine, but I was informed that she had not taken it more than ten minutes before she brought forth    perhaps this remedy may be worthy of future experiments, but I must confess that I want faith as to it's efficacy.—
