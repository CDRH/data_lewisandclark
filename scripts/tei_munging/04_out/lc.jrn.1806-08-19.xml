                  <hi rend="italic">Tuesday 19th.</hi>    This was a cloudy windy morning; and the water so rough, that our small canoes could not safely ride the waves: so we remained here and several of the men went out to hunt. We do not go on so rapidly as we did higher up the river: but having lashed our small canoes together, we go on very safe and can make 50 or 60 miles a day <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> is getting much better and we are all in good spirits. At 3 o'clock<ref target="n39081902" n="2"/> in the afternoon the wind ceased, and we proceeded on, and met with our hunters on the bank, who had killed six elk and eleven deer. We took the meat on board, proceeded on, and encamped on a sand-beach.
