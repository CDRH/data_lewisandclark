                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 13th.</hi>    There was a fine morning, and a hunter or two went out. The Indian exchanged horses with one of our men, whose horse had not recovered, and was unable to cross the mountains; and then went home to the village. At noon two of our men<ref target="n36061304" n="4"/> took their loads and went on ahead about eight miles to a small prairie to hunt until we should come up. During the afternoon the men<ref target="n36061305" n="5"/> who went out yesterday to hunt, returned with eight deer. In the evening the weather became cloudy. The musquitoes are very troublesome.
