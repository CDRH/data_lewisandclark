The sunflower is in bloom [<hi rend="italic">NB: Copy for <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Dr. Barton</name>
                  </hi>] and abundant in the river bottoms. The Indians of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> particularly those who do not cultivate maze make great uce of the seed of this plant for bread, or use it in thickening their soope.    they most commonly first parch the seed and then pound them between two smooth stones untill they reduce it to a fine meal.    to this they sometimes mearly add a portion of water and drink it in that state, or add a sufficient quantity of marrow grease to reduce it to the consistency of common dough and eate it in that manner.    the last composition I think much best and have eat it in that state heartily and think it a pallateable dish.    there is but little of the broad leafed cottonwood above the falls, much the greater portion being of the narrow leafed kind.<ref target="n17071702" n="2"/>    there are a great abundance of red yellow perple &amp; black currants, and service berries now ripe and in great perfection. I find these fruits very pleasent particularly the yellow currant<ref target="n17071703" n="3"/> which I think vastly preferable to those of our gardens.    the shrub which produces this fruit rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet; the stem simple branching and erect.    they grow closly ascociated in cops either in the oppen or timbered lands near the watercouses.    the leaf is petiolate of a pale green and resembles in it's form that of the red currant common to our gardens.<ref target="n17071704" n="4"/>    the perianth of the fructification is one leaved, five cleft, abreviated and tubular, the corolla is monopetallous funnel-shaped; very long, superior, 〈permanent tho'〉 withering and of a fine orrange colour.    five stamens and one pistillum; of the first, the fillaments are capillare, inserted into the corolla, equal, and converging; the anther ovate, biffid and incumbent.    with rispect to the second the germ is roundish, smoth, inferior pedicelled and small; the style, long, and thicker than the stamens, simple, cylinderical, smooth, and erect, withering and remains with the corolla untill the fruit is ripe.    stigma simple obtuse and withering.—    the fruit is a berry about the size and much the shape of the red currant of our gardins, like them growing in clusters supported by a compound footstalk, but the peduncles which support the several berries are longer in this species and the berries are more scattered.    it is quite as transparent as the red current of our gardens, not so ascid, &amp; more agreeably flavored.    the other species differ not at all in appearance from the yellow except in the colour and flavor of their berries. I am not confident as to the colour of the corolla, but all those which I observed while in blume as we came up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> were yellow but they might possibly have been all of the yellow kind and that the perple red and black currants here may have corollas of different tints from that of the yellow currant.—    The survice berry differse somewhat from that of the U' States<ref target="n17071705" n="5"/>    the bushes are small sometimes not more than 2 feet high and scarcely ever exceed 8 and are proportionably small in their stems, growing very thickly ascosiated in clumps.    the fruit is the same form but for the most part larger more lucious and of so deep a perple that on first sight you would think them black.—    there are two species of goosbirris<ref target="n17071706" n="6"/> here allso but neither of them yet ripe.    the choke cherries also abundant and not yet ripe.    there is Box alder, red willow and a species of sumac here also.    there is a large pine tree situated on a small island at the head of these rappids above our cam[p]; it being the first we have seen for a long distance near the river I called the island <hi rend="italic">

After making those observations we proceed, and as the canoes were still heavy loaded all persons not employed in navigating the canoes walled on shore.    the river clifts were so steep and frequently projecting into the river with their perpendicular points in such manner that we could not pass them by land, we wer therefore compelled to pass and repass the river very frequently in the couse of the evening.    the bottoms are narrow the river also narrow deep and but little current.    river from 70 to 100 yds. wide.    but little timber on the river    aspin constitutes a part of that little.    see more pine than usual on the mountains tho' still but thinly scattered.    we saw some mountain rams or bighorned anamals this evening, and no other game whatever and indeed there is but little appearance of any.    in some places both banks of the river are formed for a short distance of nearly perpendicular rocks of a dark black grannite of great hight;<ref target="n17071709" n="9"/> the river has the appearance of having cut it's passage in the course of time through this solid rock.    we ascended about 6 miles this evening from the entrance of the mountain and encamped on the Stard. side where we found as much wood as made our fires.<ref target="n17071710" n="10"/>    musquetoes still troublesome knats not as much so.—    <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> now informed me that after I left him yesterday, he saw the poles of a large lodge in praire on the Stard. side of the river which was 60 feet in diameter and appeared to have been built last fall; there were the remains of about 80 leather lodges near the place of the same apparent date. This large lodge was of the same construction of that mentioned above the <name type="place" key="White Bear Islands">white bear Islands</name>.    the party came on very well and encamped on the lower point of an island near the Stard. shore on that evening.    this morning they had set out early and proceeded without obstruction untill they reached the rappid where I was encamped.</p>

At 8 o'clock we came to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis's</name> camp, at a very rapid place of the river, and took breakfast. We had here to join the crews of two canoes together, to go up the rapids which were about half a mile long. The <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> at this place is very narrow. At the head of these rapids a fine spring comes in on the south side,<ref target="n17071717" n="17"/> which rises about a quarter of a mile from the river; and has a good deal of small cotton-wood and willows on its banks. There is also another spring below the rapids, but it sinks before it reaches the river. We proceeded on through the mountains, a very desert looking part of the country. Some of the knobs or peaks of these mountains, are 700 (perhaps some nearly 1200) feet high, all rock; and though they are almost perpendicular, we saw mountain sheep on the very tops of them. We saw few other animals to day. The general breadth of the river is 100 yards. We went 11 miles and encamped in a small bottom on the north side.

Wednesday July 17th    <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, and two of our party that went up

Some of the knobs on these mountains appear to be from the nearest calculation that we can make 〈to be〉 700 feet high, and it appear'd to be a solid rock, We saw on the very top of those Nobs, Mountain sheep although they appear to be almost perpendicular, In these mountains we saw fine Springs.    The Country appears to be a mere desart, and some narrow bottoms are at the points toward the River, Willow and Grass grow in them, The grass grows high and has a broad leaf.—    The River at this place runs very Crooked &amp; runs very Rapid, and is only about 100 Yards wide, We came 11 Miles this day &amp; encamped on the North side of the River, in a bottom having, a few Cotton wood Trees growing on it.    We found a great plenty of Yellow currants this day, In the Evening the Musketoes was very trouble-some.—
