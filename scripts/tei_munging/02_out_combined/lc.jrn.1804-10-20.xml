Set out early this morning and proceeded on    the wind from the S. E after brackfast I walked out on the L.

S. (3) and one on the L. S.<ref target="n07102006" n="6"/>    passed (4) a Island Covered with willows laying in the middle of the river    no current on the L. S.    Camped    on the L.

Great numbers of Buffalow Elk &amp; Deer, Goats.    our hunters killed 10 Deer &amp; a Goat today and wounded a white Bear    I saw Several fresh track of those animals which is 3 times as large as a mans track—, The wind hard all Day from the N. E. &amp; East, great numbers of buffalow Swiming the river</p>
               <p>
I observe near all large gangues of buffalow wolves and when the buffalow move those Anamals follow and feed on those that are killed by accident or those that are too pore or fat to Keep up with the gangue.

We encamped on the south side, and our hunters came in having killed 14 deer, a goat and a wolf; and one of them wounded a large white bear.
