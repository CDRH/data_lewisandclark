A delightfull morning    set out at an early hour and proceeded on very well, imployed the chord principally; the shores are abbrupt and bould and composed of a black and yellow clay: see no extensive collection of pure sand, the bars are composed black mud and a small poportion of fine sand;<ref target="n13052101" n="1"/> the courant still pretty strong.    the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> in it's course downward makes a suddon and extensive bend to receive the <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Muscle shell river</name>, the point of country thus formed tho' high is still much lower than that surrounding it, thus forming a valley of wavey country which extends itself for a great distance in a Northerly direction; the soil is fertile, produces a fine turf of low grass and some herbs, also immence quantities of the Prickley pear, without a stick of timber of any discription.    the country on the South side is high broken and crowned with some scrubby pines and dwarf cedar; the leaf of this pine is much longer than the common pitch or red pine of <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>, the cone is also longer and slimer, and the imbrications wider and thicker, and the whole frequently covered with rosin. Mineral appearances as usual.    the growse or praire hen are now less abundant on the river than they were below; perhaps they betake themselves to the open plains at a distance from the river at this season.<ref target="n13052102" n="2"/>

The wind which was moderate all the fore part of the day continued to encrease in the evening, and about dark veered about to N. W. and blew a storm all night, in short we found ourselves so invelloped with clouds of dust and sand that we could neither cook, eat, nor sleep; and were finally compelled to remove our lodge about eight oClock at night to the foot of an adjacent hill where we were covered in some measure from the wind by the hills.    several loose articles blown over board and lost.    our first station was on a bar on Stard. opposite the lower point of a small Island, which we now called <name type="place" key="Windy Island">windy Island</name>.<ref target="n13052103" n="3"/>    the bends of the river are short and suddon, the points covered with some cottonwood, larger willow, or broadleafed willow with an abundance of the wild rose and some small honeysuckle bushes constitute the undergrowth, the redwood is also found in small quantities. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C</name> walked on shore today and killed 2 Elk; the party killed several deer and a buffaloe Cow.—</p>

Tuesday 21st 1805.    a clear pleasant morning.    the 2 men returned who Stayed out all night had caught one beaver &amp; killed a deer.    they Swam across the <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Mussel Shell River</name> before Sun rise.    Soon after we Set off.    another beaver was caught    we proceeded on.    passed timbred bottoms &amp; hilly land on each Side, but the River hills are not So high, as they were for Some distance below.    Some of the party yesterday discovered a high range of mountains<ref target="n13052108" n="8"/> to the west, a long distance off.    we Saw Some old Indian Camps in a timbred bottom on N. S. where <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> killed an Elk.    about 1 oC. P. M. we halted to dine at a handsom timbred bottom on the South Shore.    one of the hunters killed an Elk.    the wind rose So high from the N. W. that we delayed about 2 hours and proceeded on    passed bottoms &amp; pine hills as usal.    Came about 15 Miles and Camped on a large Sand beach on N. S.    one of the hunters killed a buffaloe another killed a beaver.    the wind rose verry high Soon after we Camped, and made the Sand fly So that it was verry disagreeable.    the most of the party moved back towards the hills.</p>
               <p>
Tuesday May 21st    This morning we had clear and pleasant Weather; the Men that were out catching beaver returned this Morning at day light.    they had bad success, having caught only one Beaver, however they kill'd a deer, both of which they brought to our Camp.    We set out early, and passed bottoms covered with Timber, and hilly land lying on both sides of the River.    The Hills here are not so high, as they were below,—    Some of our party that was out hunting Yesterday, reported that they had seen, a high ridge of Mountains, which lay to the West, but appeared to be a very great distance from them, We proceeded on, and passed by some Bottom land, lying on the North side of the River where we saw some Indian Camps, that were old; 
these Camps were surrounded with Cotton Wood Trees, 〈where〉 <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> went on shore at that place, and killed an Elk, we shot a Beaver in the River, on our way here this day.—    About 1 o'Clock P. M. we halted to dine in a bottom of Timber, lying on the South side of the River, where one of our hunters killed an Elk.—    The wind rose here, to a very great height, from the North west so that we were forced to halt for two hours at that place.—</p>
               <p>
We proceeded on our Voyage about 3 o'Clock P. M and passed bottom land &amp; Pine hills, lying on both sides of the River, and came about 5 Miles and encamped on a Sand beach, lying on the North side of the River, our hunters that were out, killed a Buffalo, and a Beaver which was brought to our Camp, Soon after we encamped, the Wind blew so very hard, and the sand flew so much; that it made the place disagreeable, that most of our party moved back to some hills not far distant from the River.—
