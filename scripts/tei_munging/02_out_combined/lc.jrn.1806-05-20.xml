It rained the greater part of last night and continued this morning untill noon when it cleared away about an hour and then rained at intervals untill 4 in the evening.    our covering is so indifferent that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt C.</name> and myself lay in the water the greater part of the last night. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>, and the two <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Feildses</name> set out on a hunting excurtion towards the mountains. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> came in unsuccessfull, they had wounded a bear and a deer last evening but the night coming on they were unable to pursue them, and the snow which fell in the course of the night and this morning had covered the blood and rendered all further pursuit impracticable.    at 2 P. M. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labuish</name> arrived with a large buck of the Mule deer<ref target="n35052001" n="1"/> speceis which he had killed on <name type="place" key="Lolo (Collins's) Creek (Idaho)">Collins's Creek</name> yesterday.    he had left <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Cruzatte</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> on the Creek where they were to wait his return.    he informed us that it was snowing on the plain while it was raining at our camp in the river bottom.    late in the evening <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labuish</name> and <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">LaPage</name> set out to join <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Cruzatte</name> in order to resume their hunt early tomorrow morning.    this evening a party of indians assembled on the opposite bank of the river and viewed our camp with much attention for some time and retired.—    at 5 P. M. <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> who had been permitted to go to the village this morning returned with a pasel of Roots and bread which he had purchased.    brass buttons is an article of which they people are tolerable fond, the men have taken advantage of their prepossession in favour of buttons and have devested themselves of all they had in possesson which they have given in exchange for roots and bread.
