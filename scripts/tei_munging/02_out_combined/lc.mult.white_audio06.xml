               <hi rend="right"/>From that time on, it became known that the white people had laws. Right then, when the white men were to come across the ocean for the first time, our land had already been sold by them to the Government, their king or leader. The white man told their leader, "You give me a ship to go across to look for some land. There is land over there. If we find some land," they told the Government, their king, "it will be your land." They hadn't even seen our land yet, and they had already sold it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="right"/>The white man crossed and landed. They stuck a pole and flag in the ground, claiming the land. We lost our land, they beat us out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="right"/>The first Indians they saw, the whites showed the Indians necklaces, string, or something; the people liked them. They enjoyed the jewelry. We believed their words.</p>
