This morning at seven oCk. we were joined by <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergt. Pryor</name> and the three hunters    they brought with them 4 deer which <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> had killed yesterday.    we took breakfast and departed.    at 9 A. M. the wind arrose and continued hard all day but not so violent as to prevent our proceeding.    we kept close along the N. shore all day.    the river from the rapids as high as the commencement of the narrows is from ½ to ¾ of a mile in width, and possesses scarcely any current.    the bed is principally rock except at the entrance of <name type="place" key="Hood (Labiche's) River">Labuish's river</name>
                  <ref target="n31041401" n="1"/> which heads in <name type="place" key="Mount Hood (Timm, Falls Mountain)">Mount hood</name> and like the <name type="place" key="Sandy (Quicksand) River">quicksand river</name> brings down from thence vast bodies of sand.    the mountains through which the river pases nearly to the <name type="place" key="Lower Memaloose Island (Sepulcher Rock)">sepulchre rock</name>,<ref target="n31041402" n="2"/> are high broken, rocky, partially covered with fir white cedar, and in many places exhibit very romantic seenes.    some handsome cascades are seen on either hand tumbling from the stupendious rocks of the mountains into the river.    near the border of the river I observed today the long leafed pine.<ref target="n31041403" n="3"/>    this pine increases in quantity as you ascend the river and about the <name type="place" key="Lower Memaloose Island (Sepulcher Rock)">sepulchre rock</name> where the lower country commnces it superceedes the fir altogether.    throughout the whole course of this river from the rapids as high as the <name type="native_nation" key="White Salmon Indians">Chilluckkittequaws</name>, we find the trunks of many large pine trees sanding erect as they grew at present in 30 feet water; they are much doated<ref target="n31041404" n="4"/> and none of them vegetating; at the lowest tide of the river many of these trees are in ten feet water.    certain it is that those large pine trees never grew in that position, nor can I account for this phenomenon except it be that the passage of the river through the narrow pass at the rapids has been obstructed by the rocks which have fallen from the hills into that channel within the last 20 years; the appearance of the hills at that place justify this opinion, they appear constantly to be falling in, and the apparent state of the decayed trees would seem to fix the era of their decline about the time mentioned.    at 1 P. M. we arrived at a large village situated in a narrow bottom on the N. side a little above the entrance of <name type="place" key="White Salmon River (Canoe Creek)">canoe creek</name>.<ref target="n31041405" n="5"/>    their houses are reather detatched and extent for several miles.    they are about 20 in number. These people call themselves <name type="native_nation" key="White Salmon Indians">We-ock-sock, Wil-la-cum</name>.<ref target="n31041406" n="6"/>    they differ but litte in appeance dress &amp;c. from those of the rapids.    Their men have some leging and mockersons among them. these are in the stile of <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name>.    they have some good horses of which we saw ten or a douzen.    these are the fist horses we have met with since we left this neighbourhood last fall, in short the country below this place will not permit the uce of this valuable animal except in the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbian</name> vally and there the present inhabitants have no uce for them as they reside immediately on the river and the country is too thickly timbered to admit them to run the game with horses if they had them.    we halted at this village and dined.    purchased five dogs [<hi rend="italic">one word erased</hi>] some roots, shappalell, filberds<ref target="n31041407" n="7"/> and dryed burries of the inhabitants.    here I observed several habitations entirely under grownd; they were sunk about 8 feet deep and covered with strong timber and several feet of earth in a conic form.    these habitations were evacuated at present.    they are about 16 feet in diameter, nearly circular, and are entered through a hole at the top which appears to answer the double purpose of a chimney and a door.    from this entrance you decend to the floor by a ladder.    the present habitations of these people were on the surface of the ground and do not differ from those of the tribes of the rapids.    their language is the same with that of the <name type="native_nation" key="White Salmon Indians">Chilluckkittesquaws</name>.    these people appeared very friendly.    some of them informed us that they had lately returned from a war excurtion against the <name type="native_nation" key="Paiute Indians">snake indians</name> who inhabit the upper part of the <name type="place" key="Willamette (Multnomah) River">Multnomah river</name> to the S. E. of them.    they call them <hi rend="italic">

                  <ref target="n31041408" n="8"/>    that they had been fortunate in their expedition and had taken from their enimies most of the horses which we saw in their possession.    after dinner we pursued our voyage; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked on shore with <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>. I ascended the river about six miles at which place the river washed the base of high clifts on the Lard. side, here we halted a few minutes and were joined by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> and <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> and proceeded on to the entrance of a small run<ref target="n31041409" n="9"/> on N. side a little below a large village on the same side opposite the <name type="place" key="Lower Memaloose Island (Sepulcher Rock)">sepulchre rock</name>.    this village can raise about an hundred fighting men they call themselves [<hi rend="italic">NB: <name type="native_nation" key="Wishram-Wasco Indians">Smack-shops</name>.</hi>]<ref target="n31041410" n="10"/>    they do not differ in any rispect from the village below.    many of them visited our camp this evening and remained with us untill we went to bed.    they then left us and retired to their quarters.—

Some handsom Cascades are Seen on either Side tumbling from the Stupendious rocks of the mountains into the river. I observe near the river the long leafed Pine which increas as we assend and Superseeds the fir altogether about the <name type="place" key="Lower Memaloose Island (Sepulcher Rock)">Sepulchre rock</name>.

These horses appeared in good case. The wind blew hard from the southwest and the weather was clear and cool, but there has been no frost lately, except on the tops of the high hills. We stayed here three hours, and then proceeded on; passed several Indian camps, and halted at a small creek on the north side, where there are a number of Indian lodges.
