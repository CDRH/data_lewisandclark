            <p>
The essential, definitive record of the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expedition is contained in
the journals and observations of the two captains, "the writingest explorers of their
time," in the words of Donald Jackson.<ref target="n01" n="1"/> If no one else associated with the enterprise had written a word we would still have a marvelous narrative replete with geographic, zoological, botanical, and ethnographic information. In fact, however, at
least four other members of the party did set down their own daily accounts. This
edition brings them together with those of their commanders for the first time.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Thomas Jefferson</name> did not order the actual keeping of separate journals by anyone other than the captains. In his final instructions to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, however, he did suggest that "several copies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at leisure times, &amp; put into the care of the most trust-worthy of your attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will
be exposed."<ref target="n02" n="2"/> All this would seem to require is that some of the "attendants" copy
the captains' journals verbatim. Apparently <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, at an early stage, decided to do something else. On May 26, 1804, less than two weeks out from <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River
Dubois</name>, the captains noted that "The sergts . . . are directed each to keep a separate
journal from day to day of all passing accurences, and such other observations on
the country &amp;c. as shall appear to them worthy of notice.—"<ref target="n03" n="3"/>
            </p>
            <p>
In his last communication to <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> in April 1805, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>
wrote: "We have encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of them do so, to
whom in this respect we give every assistance in our power."<ref target="n04" n="4"/>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> had a sense of
history; in departing westward from the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages he compared his little fleet
of pirogues and canoes to the vessels of <name type="person" key="Cook, James">Captain Cook</name>.<ref target="n05" n="5"/> The significance of his enterprise warranted as complete a record as possible. It might be too much to ask any
enlisted men to copy their officers' voluminous journals, but those so inclined could
be encouraged to add their bit to the record.</p>
            <p>
At least some of the men who went with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> seem to have shared that
sense of history. They were volunteers, after all, and although some of them no
doubt simply hoped to escape from irksome military discipline or to find good beaver streams, others evidently knew very well that this was the chance of a lifetime,
that they were involved in something that would survive them, something greater
than their individual contribution. The combination of that sense of history with a
degree of literacy and considerable diligence made a few of them journal keepers.</p>
            <p>
To appreciate the work of these men, let us remember the conditions under
which they wrote. Most days of the voyage involved hard physical labor, working
canoes upstream, loading and unloading bulky equipment, hunting and butchering, tanning leather, making moccasins, cooking, chopping and shaping wood, caring for horses and searching for strays, mounting guard, portaging around falls and rapids, all of it while exposed to every kind of weather and to the attacks of insects
and grizzly bears, with the constant danger of physical injury from accidents. At the
end of such a day, perhaps while others were dancing to <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte's</name> fiddle, a
journal keeper would have to write by the light of a campfire in notebooks somehow
kept safe from the elements. According to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, seven of the thirty-odd men had
the perseverance and the sense of the destiny to try.</p>
            <p>
They wrote under the same conditions as the captains, and like them wrote not
only for themselves. It seems probable that they examined each other's journals,
and perhaps <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> read them, too. We know that on July 14, 1804, having
lost his notes for the previous day, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had "to refur to the . . . Journals of Serjeants." The enlisted men's journals were intended as part of the record; they were
public documents and we cannot expect any deep psychological revelations. No one
recorded explicitly, for example, his opinion of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> or <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> or <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>.</p>
            <p>
Literacy was the first requirement. It is probable that some of the men could not
even write their own names. Historians have expressed considerable humor over
<name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> awkward grammar and his versatility as a speller, but he was little worse than
many contemporaries who like him were men of affairs, government officials, and
army officers. Comparison of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> journal with those of the enlisted men should
keep us from laughing too much at <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Nor should we be overly amused at the
enlisted men, for none of their journals suggests stupidity or dullness. They tried to
the best of their ability to record an extraordinary experience.</p>
            <p>
Sergeants in the army had to be literate, since they kept records for their companies, and it is not too surprising that three of the four enlisted men's journals that
we now have are those of sergeants. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name> and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd</name> held that rank
from the start of the trip, and <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name> was promoted some three months out to
fill the place of the deceased <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</name> is the only private whose
journal we now have. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name> spelling and grammar are, if anything, better than
<name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>. We cannot judge <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name> performance for we do not have his original writing.
<name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> apparently struggled with writing, but there is rarely doubt
about what they meant.</p>
            <p>
We have four enlisted men's journals, in one form or another. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> indicated
that seven men were keeping journals, and the discrepancy requires some notice,
although few hard conclusions can be made. Since the other sergeants were expected to keep journals, one would assume that <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</name> would
also do so, but no document demonstrating this has come to light. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> served later
on as an army officer and an Indian agent, but other men who could barely sign their names filled those posts on the
frontier. On August 12, 1806, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> noted that
<name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> had left behind saddlebags containing his "papers," but <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> had just returned from being separated from the main party, and the papers could have consisted only of letters he was supposed to deliver to a Canadian trader, and perhaps
a journal of his separate trip, which began barely three weeks before. In any case,
<name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> went back and recovered the saddlebags, so the papers, whatever they were,
were not then lost. There is simply no clear evidence to show that <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> was one of
the seven journal keepers mentioned by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>.</p>
            <p>
It is fairly certain that one private besides <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> kept some sort of journal,
because <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Robert Frazer</name> announced his intention to publish by issuing a prospectus
soliciting subscribers barely a month after the party returned to <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, promising
"An accurate description of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and its several branches; of the mountains
separating the Eastern from the Western waters; of the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name> and the Bay
it forms on the <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>; of the face of the Country in general; of the several
Tribes of Indians on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name> rivers . . . ," and with all this "a
variety of Curious and interesting occurrences during a voyage of two years four
months and nine days." The account, <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name> made clear, was "Published by Permission of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captn. Meriwether Lewis</name>."<ref target="n06" n="6"/> If the journal was anything like what <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name>
promised, that it was never published is a great pity. Given the importance of the
expedition this is surprising, especially since <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name> was able to secure publication of his work the next year and since there were six further editions of his book
in six years. Clearly it was not lack of public interest in <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> discoveries
that held <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer's</name> work back. Whatever the problem was, <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name> passed from view
and so did his journal; we have no clue as to its fate.</p>
            <p>
In April 1805, when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> wrote that seven men were keeping journals, <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> was
already dead. If we accept <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name> as journal keepers, along with <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>,
<name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>, we still have two others to account for. It is possible that
<name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> counted <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, whose journal was sent back from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, even though
his record had ceased the previous August. There is a possibility that <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Private Alexander Willard</name> kept a journal, and with <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> we would have <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> seven journal keepers.<ref target="n07" n="7"/> One way or another a considerable part of the record appears to be lost, perhaps forever.</p>
            <p>
The journals that remain belong with those of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, supporting them
to the best of their ability as they did during the voyage. After the return <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>
evaluated his men, each according to his individual merits, and then wrote of them
all: "the Ample support which they gave me under every difficulty; the manly firmness which they evinced on every necessary occasion; and the patience and fortitude
with which they submitted to, and bore, the fatigues and painful sufferings incident to my late tour to the <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>, entitles them to my warmest approbation
and thanks."<ref target="n08" n="8"/>

            </p>
            <p>
Of <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</name> we know even less than about <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, less 
indeed than we know even about some expedition members who kept no journals. 
He said he was born in <name type="place" key="Fairfax County, Va.">Fairfax County</name>, <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>, in about 1775; his family moved to 
<name type="place" key="Kentucky">Kentucky</name> in 1784. He first enlisted in the regular army in 1798 and ended a standard five-year enlistment in 1803, having served in <name type="person" key="Bissell, Daniel">Daniel Bissell's</name> company of the First Infantry.<ref target="n09" n="9"/> He evidently reenlisted since, like <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, he was serving in <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Captain Russell Bissell's</name> company of the First Infantry at <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskia</name> when he 
joined <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, probably in November 1803. In the introduction to the fair copy of 
his journal he said that "I was led at an early period of my life to enter into the Army 
of the United States, by views I had to acquire military knowledge, &amp; to be acquainted with the Country in which I was born." We may take this to mean that, like 
many young men, he joined up for adventure and travel. He claims that during his 
service at <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskia</name> he conversed with traders doing business with the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri
River</name> tribes and began thinking "that there might be a practicability of penetrating 
across the Continent of North America, to the <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name> by way of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri
River</name>." If this is an accurate account of his thoughts, then it may be that when <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Captain Bissell</name> was ordered to furnish men for the Corps of Discovery he picked <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>, knowing that he was interested in such an enterprise. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> did not say that he volunteered; he thought that he was "fortunate in being chosen" as one 
of the party, "which contributed much to quicken the execution of my favorite project, and of satisfying my own ambition." The words may be those of <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> scribe or editor, but there is no reason to assume that a humble private was incapable of dreams and ambitions like those nourished by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name> for years 
before the expedition.</p>
            <p>
On December 26, 1803, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> refers to him as "<name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Corpl. White house</name>," perhaps 
an error since nowhere else during the expedition does he appear with this rank. 
Sometime in April 1804, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> notes that "<name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Wh[itehouse]</name> wishes to return," which 
can be interpreted in at least two ways. Either <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> was dissatisfied and 
wanted to return to his old company at <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskia</name>, or he was one of the expedition 
members expelled for misconduct at <name type="place" key="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)">Camp Dubois</name>, who were then allowed to return to the party after expressing repentance.<ref target="n10" n="10"/> At any rate, <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> did not 
choose to leave the expedition and was one of those chosen for the permanent 
party.</p>
            <p>
There was little else about <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> service with the Corps of Discovery that 
was remarkable. On May 17, 1804, he was one of the members of a court-martial 
trying <name type="person" key="Werner, William">William Werner</name> and <name type="person" key="Hall, Hugh">Hugh Hall</name> for disobedience. He was almost bitten by a 
rattlesnake on July 11, 1805, and was nearly killed in a canoe accident a month later. 
He took his discharge soon after the return to <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> and received $166.66⅔ in 
pay and a land grant which he promptly sold to his comrade <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>. 
Civilian life apparently presented difficulties not encountered in a trek to <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">the Pacific</name>; <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> was arrested for debt in <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> in 1807, and he reenlisted in the 
army in December of that year. He was stationed on the western frontier, serving at 
<name type="place" key="Fort Osage (Mo.)">Fort Osage</name> in 1808; he was there when he again reenlisted in 1812. In the War of 
1812 he served on the Canadian border and was in combat in the <name type="place" key="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</name> area 
in 1814. In August 1813 he was reduced in rank from corporal to private. He may 
have been one of those old soldiers who are at their best on active service but get 
into trouble on garrison duty. In 1816 he served for a time in the Corps of Artillery, 
reenlisted, and then deserted in February 1817. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> could learn nothing of him 
in the 1820s. Descriptions in his service records indicate that he was five feet, ten 
inches tall, had light brown hair, a fair complexion and hazel eyes, and was a skin 
dresser by trade.<ref target="n11" n="11"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> journal begins with the official start of the expedition on May 14, 
1804; what we have of the original runs to November 6, 1805, but a paraphrased 
version continues to April 2, 1806.<ref target="n12" n="12"/>
               <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> tells us that "In this Voyage I furnished myself with books, and also got from captains <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, every information that lay in their power, in order to compleat and make my journal correct 
(p. 6)." This statement not only indicates some intellectual curiosity on <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> part but may suggest that his journal originally ran to the end of the expedition and was "compleat" in that sense. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> also notes that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> kept his journal for him "when I was on a fatigue party." That statement provides one of the 
few insights into the relations between the captains and their men, and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> 
has more to say on that subject. These words, written when he was no longer under 
their command, praise "the manly, and soldier-like behavior; and enterprizing abilities; of both <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> . . . and the humanity shown at all times by them, to those under their command, on this perilous and important Voyage of discovery."</p>
            <p>
It has been suggested that <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> gave up writing his journal because writing was too much of a burden for a man of his limited education. Yet if we examine 
his work we find that his entries become fuller and more informative with time, as 
he got into the rhythm of his task and understood better what he was about. At <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort 
Mandan</name> and <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, when less was happening and there were no new sights, 
his entries become briefer, and gaps appear, but when there were new and varied 
experiences to report and new country to describe, <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> would give it a try, 
in spite of weather, fatigue, grammar, or spelling.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> original journal, as we now have it, consists of a single volume of 
three parts bound in animal skin, running from May 14, 1804, to November 6, 
1805. It was once thought that he ceased writing on that last date, but we now know 
that this is certainly not the case. On his deathbed, <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> gave the original 
journal to his Catholic confessor, Canon di Vivaldi; this may have been around 
1860. Later, Gertrude Haley of San Francisco loaned the priest money, and he gave 
her the journal in return. It passed into various hands, including those of the New York Historical Society. Haley regained possession and tried to sell it to the Library 
of Congress, which would not pay her asking price. Finally, Dodd, Mead and Company purchased it for the use of Reuben Gold Thwaites in his edition of the expedition journals.<ref target="n13" n="13"/>
            </p>

Seeing <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> difficulties with the language, Thwaites and others assumed 
that he had simply grown weary of writing in November 1805 and stopped. That 
notion was exploded by another of the fortuitous discoveries that mark the entire 
history of the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> journals. In February 1966, Professor George White, 
a geologist from the University of Illinois–Urbana, visited <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name> and in a 
bookstore was shown the manuscript of a journal by <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</name>. Returning 
home, he told his university colleague Donald Jackson, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Letters of the 
<name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition</hi>, who in turn informed the Newberry Library of <name type="place" key="Chicago, Ill.">Chicago</name>, 
then and now holder of the original journal. The Newberry obtained the new find 
and Jackson was able to examine it. It was a single notebook, written by someone 
other than <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> himself, running from May 14, 1804, to April 2, 1806. Just 
before the March 23, 1806, entry there is a heading, "Volume 2nd"; this would 
seem to indicate that there was a good deal more to come, and that <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> may 
have completed his journal to September 23, 1806. This paraphrased version fills 
in some gaps in the original as we now have it.<ref target="n14" n="14"/>
            </p>
            <p>
Jackson finally concluded that the new find, interesting as it was, did not provide 
enough new information to justify publication on its own.<ref target="n15" n="15"/> It does, however, extend 
<name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse's</name> record of the expedition by several months, and appears here so that 
this edition may be as complete as possible.</p>
