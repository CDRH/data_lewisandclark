                  <hi rend="italic">Wednesday 10th.</hi>    This day I went with some of the men to the lodges, about 60 in number. The following is a description of the form of these lodges and the manner of building them.</p>
               <p>
In a circle of a size suited to the dimensions of the intended lodge, they set up 16 forked posts five or six feet high, and lay poles from one fork to another. Against these poles they lean other poles, slanting from the ground, and extending about four inches above the cross poles: these are to receive the ends of the upper poles, that support the roof. They next set up four large forks, fifteen feet high, and about ten feet apart, in the middle of the area; and poles or beams between these. The roof poles are then laid on extending from the lower poles across the beams which rest on the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name>s, of such a length as to leave a hole at the top for a chimney. The whole is then covered with willow branches, except the chimney and a hole below to pass through. On the willow branches they lay grass and lastly clay. At the hole below they build a pen about four feet wide and projecting ten feet 
from the hut; and hang a buffaloe skin, at the entrance of the hut for a door. This labour like every other kind is chiefly performed by the squaws. They raise corn, beans, and tobacco. Their tobacco<ref target="n07101014" n="14"/> is different from any I had before seen: it answers for smoking, but not for chewing. On our return, I crossed from the island to the boat, with two squaws in a buffaloe skin stretched on a frame made of boughs, wove together like a crate or basket for that purpose.<ref target="n07101015" n="15"/>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name> held a Council with the Indians, and gave them some presents.

Wednesday October 10th    This morning some of our Men, with the Two frenchmen that stayed with us during last night, went off to the Indian Village, they found 〈there to be〉 that Village to contain 60 lodges in number, forming 16 Square 〈in〉 the whole forming a Circle of about 30 feet    〈they are〉    These lodges were about Six feet high—    The lodges are constructed by laying poles from One fork to the other, and the whole is laid on, in the like manner and they had cover'd the Tops of them over with Willows and Grass, and a thick Coat of mud over all, and had left 〈in〉 a hole in the Top which served for a chimney—and a place for a door, at the entry place.—    The〈ir〉 labour is chiefly performed by their Squaws, The Men returned, with three bands of the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Rick a Rees</name>, being the whole Nation; and our Officers held a treaty with them on the bank of the River, and made them some presents, And gave them a talk, which they received &amp; seemed highly pleased &amp; They went back to their Villages in the Evening—
