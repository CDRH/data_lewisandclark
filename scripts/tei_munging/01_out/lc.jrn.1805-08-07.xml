The morning being fair we spread our stores to dry at an early hour. Dispatched <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name> in surch of <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>.    our stores were now so much exhausted that we found we could proceed with one canoe less. we therefore drew out one of them into a thicket of brush and secured her in such manner that the water could not take her off should the river rise to the hight where she is. The creek which falls in above us we called <name type="place" key="Indian (Turf) Creek (Mont.)">turf creek</name> from the cercustance of it's bottoms being composed of excellent turf.<ref target="n18080701" n="1"/>    my air gun was out of order and her sights had been removed by some accedent I put her in order and regulated her.    she shot again as well as she ever did. The clouds last night prevented my taking any lunar observations    this day I took Equal Altitudes of the <seg n="u9737">☉</seg> with Sextant.</p>

This evening <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> brought in a deer which he had killed.    we have not heard any thing from <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> yet, we expect that he has pursued <name type="place" key="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River">Wisdom river</name> upwards for som distance probably killed some heavy animal and is waiting our arrival.    the large biteing fly or hare fly as they sometimes called are very troublesome to us. I observe two kinds of them a large black species and a small brown species with a green head.    the musquetoes are not as troublesome as they were below, but are still in considerable quantities.    the eye knats have disappeared. the green or blowing flies are still in swarms.<ref target="n18080703" n="3"/>
