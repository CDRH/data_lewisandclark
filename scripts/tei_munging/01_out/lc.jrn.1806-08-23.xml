We Set out very early, the wind rose &amp; became very hard, we passed the <name type="place" key="Moreau (Sur-war-kar-ne) River (S. Dak.)">Sar-war-kar-na-har river</name>
                  <ref target="n39082301" n="1"/> at 10 A. M and at half past eleven the wind became So high and the water So rough that we were obliged to put to Shore and Continue untill 3 p. M. when we had a Small Shower of rain after which the wind lay, and we proceeded on. Soon after we landed I Sent <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name> &amp; <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Jo.</name> &amp; <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name> down to the next bottom of timber to hunt untill our arival.    we proceeded on Slowly and landed in the bottom.    the hunters had killed three Elk and 3 Deer the deer were pore and Elk not fat    had them fleece &amp; brought in.    the Musqueters large and very troublesom.    at 4 P. M a Cloud from the N W with a violent rain for about half an hour    after the rain we again proceeded on. I observe great quantities of Grapes and Choke Cheries, also a Speces of Currunt<ref target="n39082302" n="2"/> which I had never before observed the leas is larger than those above, the Currt. black and very inferior to either the yellow, red, or perple—    at dark we landed on a Small Sand bar under a Bluff on the S W. Side and encamped,<ref target="n39082303" n="3"/> this Situation was one which I had Chosen to avoid the Musquetors, they were not very troublesome after we landed.    we Came only <hi rend="italic">40</hi> Miles to daye</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Saturday 23rd.</hi>    We set out early in a fine morning, but the wind was high; and we went on very well till near noon, when the wind blew so hard that we had to halt, and were detained about four hours. Three hunters<ref target="n39082304" n="4"/> went on ahead by land, and when we had overtaken them they had killed two elk and some deer, and we halted to take in the meat. Here we had a very heavy shower of rain, which detained us another hour. We encamped at night and found the musquitoes very troublesome.
