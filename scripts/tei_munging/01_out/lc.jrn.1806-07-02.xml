We sent out the hunters early this morning, they returned not so successfull as yesterday having killed 2 deer only. <name type="place" key="Shields, John">Sheilds</name> continued repairing the gunns which he compleated by evening.    all arrangements being now compleat we determined to set out in the morning.    in the course of the day we had much conversation with the indians by signs, our only mode of communicating our ideas.    they informed us that they wished to go in surch of the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Ootslashshoots</name> their friends and intended leaving us tomorrow morning, I prevailed on them to go with me as far as the <name type="place"
                        key="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River">East branch of Clark's River</name>
                  <ref target="n36070201" n="1"/> and put me on the road to the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. I gave the Cheif a medal of the small size; he insisted on exchanging names with me according to their custom which was accordingly done and I was called Yo-me-kol-lick which interpreted is <hi rend="italic">the white bearskin foalded.</hi>    in the evening the indians run their horses, and we had several foot races betwen the natives and our party with various success.    these are a race of hardy strong athletic active men.    nothin worthy of notice transpired in the course of the day. <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name> and <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name> are both very unwell with the pox which they contracted last winter with the <name type="native_nation" key="Chinook Indians">Chinnook</name> women this forms my inducement principally for taking them to the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">falls of the Missouri</name> where during an intervail of rest they can use the murcury freely. I found two speceis of native clover here, the one with a very narrow small leaf and a pale red flower, the other nearly as luxouriant as our red clover with a white flower the left and blume of the latter are proportionably large.<ref target="n36070202" n="2"/> I found several other uncommon plants specemines of which I preserved.<ref target="n36070203" n="3"/> The leaf of the cottonwood<ref target="n36070204" n="4"/> on this river is like that common to the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name> narrower than that common to the lower part of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> and wider than that on the upper part of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    the wild rose, servise berry, white berryed honeysuckle, seven bark, elder,<ref target="n36070205" n="5"/> alder aspin,<ref target="n36070206" n="6"/> chock cherry and the broad and narrow leafed willow<ref target="n36070207" n="7"/> are natives of this valley.    the long leafed pine forms the principal timber of the neighbourhood, and grows as well in the river bottoms as on the hills.    the firs and larch are confined to the higher parts of the hills and mountains.<ref target="n36070208" n="8"/>    the tops of the high mountains on either side of this river are covered with snow.    the musquetoes have been excessively troublesome to us since our arrival at this place.
