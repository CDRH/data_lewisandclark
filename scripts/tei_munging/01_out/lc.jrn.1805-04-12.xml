Set out at an early hour.    our peroge and the Canoes passed over to the Lard side in order to avoid a bank which was rappidly falling in on the Stard.    the red perogue contrary to my expectation or wish passed under this bank 〈with〉 by means of her toe line where I expected to have seen her carried under every instant. I did not discover that she was about to make this attempt untill it was too late for the men to reembark, and retreating is more dangerous than proceeding in such cases; they therefore continued their passage up this bank, and much to my satisfaction arrived safe above it.    this cost me some moments of uneasiness, her cargo was of much importance to us in our present advanced situation—    We proceeded on six miles and came too on the lower side of the entrance of the <name type="place" key="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River">little Missouri</name> on the Lard shore in a fine plain where we determined to spend the day for the purpose of celestial observation.<ref target="n11041201" n="1"/>    we sent out 10 hunters to procure some fresh meat.    at this place made the following observations.—</p>

The night proved so cloudly that I could make no further observations. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drewyer</name> shot a Beaver this morning, which we found swiming in the river a small distance below the entrance of the <name type="place" key="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River">little Missouri</name>.    the beaver being seen in the day, is a proof that they have been but little hunted, as they always keep themselves closly concealed during the day where they are so.—    found a great quantity of small onions<ref target="n11041202" n="2"/> in the plain where we encamped; had some of them collected and cooked, found them agreeable.    the bulb grows single, is of an oval form, white, and about the size of a small bullet; the leaf resem[bles] that of the shive, and the hunters returned this eving with one deer only.    the country about the mouth of this river had been recently hunted by the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetares</name>, and the little game which they had not killed and frightened away, was so extreemly shy that the hunters could not get in shoot of them.</p>
               <p>
The <name type="place" key="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River">little Missouri</name> disembogues on the S. side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> 1693 miles from the confluence of the latter with the <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>.    it is 134 yards wide at it's mouth, and sets in with a bould current but it's greatest debth is not more than 2½ feet.    it's navigation is extreemly difficult, owing to it's rapidity, shoals and sand bars.    it may however be navigated with small canoes a considerable distance.    this river passes through the Northern extremity of the <name type="place" key="Black Hills">black hills</name> where it is very narrow and rapid and it's banks high an perpendicular.    it takes it's rise in a broken country West of the <name type="place" key="Black Hills">Black hills</name> with the waters of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellow stone</name> river, and a considerable distance S. W. of the point at which it passes the <name type="place" key="Black Hills">black hills</name>.    the country through which it passes is generally broken and the highlands possess but little timber.    there is some timber in it's bottom lands, which sonsists of Cottonwood red Elm, with a small proportion of small Ash and box alder.<ref target="n11041203" n="3"/>    the under brush is willow, red wood, (sometimes called red or swamp willow—) the red burry, and Choke cherry—<ref target="n11041204" n="4"/>    the country is extreamly broken about the mouth of this river, and as far up 〈and〉 on both sides, as we could observe it from the tops of some elivated hills, which stand between these two rivers, about 3 miles from their junction.    the soil appears fertile and deep, it consists generally of a dark rich loam intermixed with a small proportion of fine sand.    this river in it's course passed near the N. W. side of the <name type="place" key="Killdeer (Turtle) Mountains">turtle mountain</name>, which is said to be no more than 4 or 5 leagues distant from it's entrance in a straight direction, a little to the S. of West.—    this mountain and the knife river have therefore been laid down too far S. W.<ref target="n11041205" n="5"/>    the colour of the water, the bed of the river, and it's appearance 〈of this river〉 in every respect, resembles the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; I am therefore induced to believe that the texture of the soil of the country in which it takes it's rise, and that through which it passes, is similar to the country through which the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> passes after leaving the woody country, or such as we are now in.—    on the side of a hill not distant from our camp I found some of the dwarf cedar of which I preserved a specimen (See No. 2).<ref target="n11041206" n="6"/>    this plant spread it's limbs alonge the surface of the earth, where they are sometimes covered, and always put forth a number of roots on the under side, while on the upper there are a great number of small shoots which with their leaves seldom rise higher than 6 or eight inches.    they grow 〈very〉 so close as perfectly to conceal the eath.    it is an evergreen; the leaf is much more delicate than the common Cedar, and it's taste and smell the same. I have often thought that this plant would make very handsome edgings to the borders and walks of a garden; it is quite as handsom as box,<ref target="n11041207" n="7"/> and would be much more easily propegated.—    the appearance of the glauber salts and Carbonated wood still continue.</p>

a fine morning    Set out verry early, the murcery Stood 56° above 0. proceeded on to the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River">Little Missouri</name> river and formed a Camp in a butifull elivated plain on the lower Side for the purpose of takeing Some observations to fix the Latitude &amp; Longitude of this river. this river falls in on the L.
