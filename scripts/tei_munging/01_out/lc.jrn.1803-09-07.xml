Foggy this morning according to custom; set out at half past seven, and in about two hundred paces stuck on a riffle    all hands obliged to get out.    observed the Thermometer at sun rise in the air to stand at 47° the tem[pe]rature of the river water being 68°—difference = 21°—    got over the riffle, at 45 mts. after 8.    passed <name type="place" key="Wellsburg, W. Va.">Charles town</name>
                  <ref target="n02090701" n="1"/> on the E. shore above the mouth of <name type="place" key="Dugout Coulee (Buffalo Creek)">Buffaloe</name> over which there is built a handsom wooden bridge, this has the appearance of a handsome little Village, containing about forty houses—    this village is three miles below our encampment of last evening—    reached <name type="place" key="Wheeling, W.

                  <ref target="n02090702" n="2"/> 16 miles distant at 5 in the evening    this is a pretty considerable Village contains about fifty houses and is the county town of <name type="place" key="Ohio, Va.">Ohio</name> (State of <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>)    it is situated on the east side of the river on an elivated bank; the landing is good, just below the town and on the same side <name type="place" key="Big Wheeling Creek">big Wheeling creek</name> emtys itself into the <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio</name>, on the point formed by this creek and the river stands an old stoccade fort,<ref target="n02090703" n="3"/> now gone to decay; this town is remarkable for being the point of embarkation for merchants and Emegrants who are about to descend the river, particularly if they are late in getting on and the water gets low as it most commonly is from the begining of July to the last of September; the water from hence being much deeper and the navigation better than it is from <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name> or any point above it—    I went on shore    waited on a <name type="person" key="Caldwell">Mr. Caldwell</name> a merchant of that place to whome I had consigned a part of my goods which I had sent by land from <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name>; found the articles in good order; her[e] met with <name type="person" key="Rodney, Thomas">Colo.
