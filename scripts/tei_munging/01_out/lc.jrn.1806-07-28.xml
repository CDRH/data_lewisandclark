The morning proved fair, I slept sound but fortunately awoke as day appeared, I awaked the men and directed the horses to be saddled, I was so soar from my ride yesterday that I could scarcely stand, and the men complained of being in a similar situation however I encourged them by telling them that our own lives as well as those of our friends and fellow travellers depended on our exertions at this moment; they were allert soon    prepared the horses and we again resumed our march; the men proposed to pass the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name> at the <name type="place" key="Grog Spring">grog spring</name>
                  <ref target="n37072801" n="1"/> where <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">rose river</name> approaches it so nearly and pass down on the S. W. side, to this I objected as it would delay us almost all day to reach the point [<hi rend="italic">EC: mouth of <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>
                  </hi>] by this circuetous rout and would give the enemy time to surprise and cut off the party at the point if they had arrived there,<ref target="n37072802" n="2"/> I told them that we owed much to the safety of our friends and that we must wrisk our lives on this occasion, that I should proceed immediately to the point and if the party had not arrived that I would raft the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name> a small distance above, hide our baggage and march on foot up the river through the timber untill I met the canoes or joined them at the falls; I now told them that it was my determination that if we were attacked in the plains on our way to the point that the bridles of the horses should be tied together and we would stand and defend them, or sell our lives as dear as we could.    we had proceeded about 12<ref target="n37072803" n="3"/> miles on an East course when we found ourselves near the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name>; we heared a report which we took to be that of a gun but were not certain; still continuing down the N. E. bank of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name> about 8 miles further, being then within five miles of the <name type="place" key="Grog Spring">grog spring</name> we heared the report of several rifles very distinctly on the river to our right, we quickly repared to this joyfull sound and on arriving at the bank of the river had the unspeakable satisfaction to see our canoes coming down.<ref target="n37072804" n="4"/>    we hurried down from the bluff on which we were and joined them striped our horses and gave them a final discharge imbrarking without loss of time with our baggage. I now learned that they had brought all things safe having sustaned no loss nor met with any accident of importance. <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Wiser</name> had cut his leg badly with a knife and was unable in consequence to work.<ref target="n37072805" n="5"/>    we decended the river opposite to our principal cash<ref target="n37072806" n="6"/> which we proceeded to open after reconnoitering the adjacent country.    we found that the cash had caved in and most of the articles burried therin were injured; I sustained the loss of two very large bear skins which I much regret; most of the fur and baggage belonging to the men were injured.    the gunpowder corn flour poark and salt had sustained but little injury the parched meal was spoiled or nearly so.    having no time to air these things which they much wanted we droped down to the point to take in the several articles which had been buried at that place in several small cashes;<ref target="n37072807" n="7"/> these we found in good order, and recovered every article except 3 traps belonging to <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> which could not be found.    here as good fortune would have it <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> who brought the horses from the falls joined us at 1 P. M. I had ordered them to bring down the horses to this place in order to assist them in collecting meat which I had directed them to kill and dry here for our voyage, presuming that they would have arrived with the perogue and canoes at this place several days before my return.    having now nothing to detain us we passed over immediately to the island in the entrance of <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name> to launch the red perogue, but found her so much decayed that it was imposible with the means we had to repare her and therefore mearly took the nails and other ironwork's about her which might be of service to us and left her.    we now reimbarked on board the white peroge and five small canoes and decended the river about 15 ms. and encamped on the S. W. side near a few cottonwood trees,<ref target="n37072808" n="8"/> one of them being of the narrow leafed speceis and was the first of that kind which we had remarked on our passage up the river.    we encamped late but having little meat I sent out a couple of hunters who soon returned with a sufficient quantity of the flesh of a fat cow.    there are immence quantities of buffaloe and Elk about the junction of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's</name> rivers.—    during the time we halted at the entrance of <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name> we experienced a very heavy shower of rain and hail attended with violent thunder and lightning.

                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 28th.</hi>    The morning was fine and pleasant, and at an early hour we proceeded down the river. In our way we killed six goats or antelopes and seven buffaloe; and about one o'clock came to the point at the mouth of <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>,<ref target="n37072833" n="33"/> where we met with the party who had come down from the falls by water, and who had just arrived; and also unexpectedly with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> and the three men who had gone with him. They had joined the party descending the river this forenoon, after riding one hundred and twenty miles since yesterday morning, when they had a skirmish with a party of the <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians, Piegan">Prairie Grossventres, or Bigbellied Indians</name> who inhabit the plains up <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>; of which they gave the following account.<ref target="n37072834" n="34"/> On the evening of the 26th <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> and his party met with eight of those Indians, who seemed very friendly and gave them two robes. In return <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> gave one of them, who was a chief, a medal; and they all continued together during the night; but after break of day the next morning, the Indians snatched up three of our men's guns and ran off with them. One Indian had the guns of two men, who pursued and caught him; and one of them killed him with his knife;<ref target="n37072835" n="35"/> and they got back the guns. Another had <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis's gun</name>, but immediately gave it up. The party then went to catch their horses, and found the Indians driving them off; when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> shot one of them, and gave him a mortal wound; who notwithstanding returned the fire, but without hurting the Captain. So our men got all their own horses but one, and a number of those belonging to the Indians, as they ran off in confusion and left every thing they had. Our men then saddled their horses, and made towards the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> as fast as possible; after <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> had satisfied himself with respect to the geography of the country up <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>.</p>
               <p>
We this day took the articles out of the place of deposit, and examined the large red periogue we left here,<ref target="n37072836" n="36"/> and found it too rotten to take down the river. We therefore took what nails out of it we could, left our horses on the plains and proceeded down the river. About the time we started a heavy gust of rain and hail, accompanied with thunder and lightning came on and lasted about an hour, after which we had a cloudy wet afternoon, and in the evening we encamped about twenty-five miles below the forks.
