               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> seems to have no entries for March 31, 1805, in either his Field Notes or Codex C, probably due to his misdating of the last few days in March. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> may have neglected either Field Notes or Codex C or both for several days during this busy time, and in resuming on or after April 1, was misled by his wrong dates and failed to realize there was no March 31 entry. The resumption of daily entries in the Field Notes on March 24 (March 25 by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> reckoning) after months of skimpy and irregular writing in them suggests that he was using them once more as the basis for Codex C during this hectic period, and that in transferring into Codex C he repeated the dating error. From April 1 his dates appear to be correct, but he still has the days of the week wrong up through the April 7 entry in Codex C. <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name> has corrected them in red, but we do not carry his emendations.</note>

            <note xml:id="n09040104" n="4">The word is difficult to read, but it is clearly a reference to the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>, the people of <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau's</name> other wife. However spelled, it is apparently a variation of "Ietan," also L'Iatan, Aliatan, and many other variants. In the captains' "Estimate of the Eastern Indians," sent back to <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

This name was applied loosely by Plains tribes and traders to the <name type="native_nation" key="Ute Indians">Utes</name>, the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>, or the <name type="native_nation" key="Comanche Indians">Comanches</name> (all "Snakes" in the sign language), depending on the context. The derivation is perhaps from the <name type="native_nation" key="Ute Indians">Utes</name>' name for themselves. Hodge, 1:594–95; 2:556–57; Hyde (IHP), 99–100, 183–84, 200–02.</note>
