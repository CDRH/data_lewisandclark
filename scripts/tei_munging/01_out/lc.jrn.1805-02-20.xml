There was also a belief that an underground village was located near the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</name> from which the precursors of the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> surfaced. These two ideas may become garbled in <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> rendition.
