The last night was disagreeably could; we were unable to set out untill 8 oclock A. M. in consequence of a heavy fogg, which obscured the river in such a manner that we could not see our way; this is the first we have experienced in any thing like so great a degree; there was also a fall of due last evening, which is the second we have experienced since we have entered this extensive open country.    at eight we set out and proceeded as yesterday by means of the cord principally, the hills are high and the country similar to that of yesterday. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> walked on shore with two of the hunters and killed a brown bear; notwithstanding that it was shot through the heart it ran as it's usual pace near a quarter of a mile before it fell.    one of the party wounded a beaver, and my dog as usual swam in to catch it; the beaver bit him through the hind leg and cut the artery; it was with great difficulty that I could stop the blood; I fear it will yet prove fatal to him.    on <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name> return he informed me that he had from the top of one of the adjacent hights<ref target="n13051901" n="1"/> discovered the entrance of a large stream which discharged itself into the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> on the Lard. side distant 6 or seven miles; from the same place he also saw a range of Mountains, bearing W. distant 40 or 50 miles; they appeared to proceed in a S. S. W. direction; the N. N. E. extremity of these mountains appeared abrupt.<ref target="n13051902" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p>
This afternoon the river was croked, rappid and containing more sawyers than we have seen in the same space since we left the entrance of the <name type="place" key="Platte River (Nebr.)">river Platte</name>.    <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> in the course of his walk killed three deer and a beaver, I also walked on shore this evening a few miles and killed an Elk, a buck, and a beaver.    the party killed and caught 4 other beaver &amp; 3 deer.</p>
