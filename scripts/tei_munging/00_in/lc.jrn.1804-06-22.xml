Both <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> journals indicate that this stream was on the starboard, or north, side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>, with the camp on the opposite side. However, <name type="place" key="Fire (Little Fire, Fire Prairie) River">Fire Creek</name> on later maps is on the south side of the river, in <name type="place" key="Jackson County, Mo.">Jackson County</name>, and is probably the <name type="place" key="Fire (Little Fire, Fire Prairie) River">Little Fire Creek</name> referred to by <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>.

Coues suggests that the mouth of <name type="place" key="Fishing (Fire Prairie River) River">Fishing River</name> had moved upstream some time after 1804. This would also simplify matters, in that the island on which the expedition was forced by wind to spend most of <ref n="1804-06-23" type="related">June 23, 1804</ref>, could be <name type="place" key="Fishing River Island">Fishing River Island</name>, which by the 1890s was downstream from the mouth of <name type="place" key="Fishing (Fire Prairie River) River">Fishing River</name>, instead of upstream from it, as the expedition's island would have to be. It is possible, however, that this island, described by <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name> as separated from the north bank by a narrow, timber-choked channel, later became part of the mainland. To add to the confusion, Nicollet shows <name type="place" key="Fire Creek">Fire Creek</name> as "Clear water Creek" and indicates a "<name type="place" key="Fishing (Fire Prairie River) River">Fire Prairie River</name>" on the south bank in present <name type="place" key="Jackson County, Mo.">Jackson County</name>, and mouthing above <name type="place" key="Fishing (Fire Prairie River) River">Fishing River</name>, which is not readily identifiable with a major stream in that vicinity today.
