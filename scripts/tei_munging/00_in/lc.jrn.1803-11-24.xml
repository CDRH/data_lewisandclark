Set out this morning at 7 OCl.    as we were bearing off, <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> the man who had been absent and lost for the last two days hailed, we passed the river and took him in    he was much fatiequed with his wandering and somewhat indisposed—   (1) The highland which sets in at <name type="place" key="Cape Girardeau, Mo.">Cape Jeredeau</name> continues with small intervals of low Land. on that side of the river, the other appearing low and subject to be overflowed for a considirable distance say 2 or three miles—    (2) this Isld. is not considerable,—    came too on the sand bar at the upper point of it and took Meridian Altitude <seg n="u9737">☉</seg>'s L. L. with Sext.    found it 64° 50' 30"    Error of sext. as usual—    (4) the main shore has been generally bold on the Lard. quart. all day but here putts in some high clifts the summits of which are crowned with pitch-pine &amp; seader,<ref target="n02112401" n="1"/> these rocks are nearly perpendicular in many places sixty feet, and the hight of the hills apear to be about 120 feet above the bank which forms their base of perhaps 15 or 18 feet tho from appearance they never over flow.    the rock which compose these clifts is a singular one tho' not uncomon to this country    it is a Limestone principally, but imbeded in this stone there are detached pieces of a stone resembleing flint of yellowish brown colour which appear at some former period to have been woarn smothe and assume different shapes and sizes as the pebbles of runing streams usually do tho' now firmly united and forming a portion of the solid mass of this rock—    many parts of the rock has also a considerable portion of grit or sand in it's composition tho' I was informed at <name type="place" key="Cape Girardeau, Mo.">Cape Jeradeau</name> where the same rock appears, that it makes very good lime—<ref target="n02112402" n="2"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">I am not confident with respect to the accuracy of the observation</hi> of this day, in consequence of some flying clouds which frequently interveened and obscured his [sun's] disk about noon and obliged me frequently to change the coloured glasses of the Sextant in order to make the observation as complete as possible.</p>
