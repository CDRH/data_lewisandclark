                  <hi rend="italic">Thursday 18th.</hi>    We had a clear pleasant morning with some frost. We set sail early, and a hunter went up each shore. Having proceeded two miles we met a couple of Frenchmen in a canoe, who had been up at the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> nation hunting, and met with a party of that nation, who robbed them of their arms, mmunition, and some fur which they had; and therefore they had to return down the river; but, meeting us, went back in hopes of recovering their property. We passed a small river, on the south side called <name type="place" key="Cannonball (Bullet) River">Cannon-ball river</name>. Several hunters went out here. We passed a creek on the north side, called <name type="place" key="Long Lake (Fish, Chewah) Creek">Fish Creek</name>, on which I killed a deer. At night we encamped on the south side, and all the hunters came in having killed six deer, four goats and a pelican.
