We thought it necessary to lay in a Store of Provisions for our voyage, and the fish being out of Season, we purchased forty dogs for which we gave articles of little value, Such as bells, thimbles, knitting pins, brass wire &amp; a few beeds all of which they appeared well Satisfied and pleased.</p>

every thing being arranged we took in our Two Chiefs, and Set out on the great <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>, haveing left our guide and the two young men two of them 〈not〉 enclined not to proceed on any further, and the 3rd could be of no Service to us as he did not know the river below</p>
               <p>
Took our leave of the Chiefs and all those about us and proceeded on down the great <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>    passed a large Island at 8 miles about 3 miles in length, a Island on the Stard. Side the upper point of which is opposit the center of the last mentioned Island and reaches 3½ miles below the 1st. Island and opposit to this near the middle of the river nine Lodges are Situated on the upper point at a rapid which is between the lower point of the 1st Island and upper point of this; great numbers of Indians appeared to be on this Island, and emence quantites of fish Scaffold    we landed a few minits to view a rapid which Commenced at the lower point, passd this rapid which was verry bad between 2 Small Islands two Still Smaller near the Lard. Side, at this rapid on the Stard. Side is 2 Lodges of Indians Drying fish, at 2½ miles lower and 14½ below the point passed an Island Close under the Stard. Side on which was 2 Lodges of Indians drying fish on Scaffolds as above    at 16 miles from the point the river passes into the range of high Countrey at which place the rocks project into the river from the high clifts which is on 〈both〉 the Lard. Side about ⅔ of the way across those of the Stard Side about the Same distance, the Countrey rises here about 200 feet above The water and is bordered wth black rugid rocks,<ref target="n23101807" n="7"/> at the Commencement of this high Countrey on Lard Side a Small riverlet falls in<ref target="n23101808" n="8"/> which appears to passed under the high County in its whole cose    Saw a mountain bearing S.

Side is <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> large Lodges of Indians Drying fish on Scaffolds as above    at this place we were called to land, as it was near night and no appearance of wood, we proceeded on about 2 miles lower to Some willows, at which place we observed a drift log    formed a Camp on the Lard Side under a high hill nearly opposit to five Lodges of Indians; Soon after we landed, our old Chiefs informed us that the large camp above "was the Camp of the 1st Chief of all the <hi rend="italic">tribes</hi> in this quarter, and that he had called to us to land and Stay all night with him, that he had plenty of wood for us &amp;"    This would have been agreeable to us if it had have been understood perticelarly as we were compelled to Use drid willows for fuel for the purpose of cooking, we requested the old Chiefs to walk up on the Side we had landed and call to the Chief to come down and Stay with us all night which they did; late at night the Chief came down accompanied by 20 men, and formed a Camp a Short distance above, the chief brought with him a large basket of mashed berries which he left at our Lodge as a present. I saw on the main land opposit those Lodges a number of horses feeding, we made 21 miles to day.

Friday October 18th    A clear pleasant morning.    Our officers delayed till after 12 o' Clock A. M. to compleat &amp; prove the observation that they had taken Yesterday, and to make farther remarks on those Two Rivers which we 
are now at.    <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> measured the width of both these Rivers.    He found the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name> (or North fork) to be 860 Yards wide at its Mouth, &amp; the <name type="place"
                        key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Ki-o-me-num</name> or <name type="place"
                        key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Lewis's River</name> to be 475 Yards wide at its Mouth also.—    Several Men of our party went out in the plains, &amp; killed a number more of Priari or heath hens, which were very large.—    <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> took down in writing, a number of Words spoken by these Indians in their language, &amp; the 
names of several things, as well as we could make them understand by signs &amp;ca—    About 2 o'Clock P. M. we proceeded again on our Voyage; and had Two Chiefs with us, that had come from the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">flatthead</name> Nation of Indians.    
We proceeded on down the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>, &amp; found it to be from half to three quarters of a Mile wide, &amp; the water running very smooth.    The Country for about 10 Miles level, &amp; then the hills made in near to the River &amp; 
some Rapid places in it.—    We passed several Islands, on which were large Camps of Indians.—</p>
               <p>
We saw likewise abundance of Scaffolds with Salmon drying on them.    The Salmon were very plenty as we came along, &amp; a number of them were jumping in the River as we passed along also, &amp; a number of dead Salmon, lay all along the shores in the River.    The Latitude at the forks of the two Rivers we last left taken by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> &amp; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> being fully ascertained is 46° 15' 13 7/10s North as before mentioned.—    We continued on our way, &amp; passed over several bad rapid places.    We also passed several large Camps of Indians, who had Lodges built of flags, and they had abundance of Salmon.    These Indians had a vast number of Horses.    We saw no Timber of any account, &amp; were forced to make use of dry Willows for fuel to cook with, some few of which grew along the Shore, where we encamped.    We encamped on the South side of the River where a number natives came shortly after in their Canoes to see us.    We came 17 Miles this day, our Course still being West.—
