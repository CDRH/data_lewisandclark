The wind blew So hard this morning from N. W. that we dared not to venture our canoes on the river.—    Observed considerable quantities of dwarf Juniper on the hill sides (see specimen No. 4)    it seldom rises higher then 3 feet.—    the wind detained us through the couse of this day, tho' we were fortunate in having placed ourselves in a safe harbour.    the party killed one Elk and a beaver today. The beaver of this part of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> are larger, fatter, more abundant and better clad with fur than those of any other part of the country that I have yet seen; I have remarked also that their fur is much darker.—</p>

the next day. While we lay here, I went out to the hills, which I found very 
high, much washed by the rain, and without grass. I saw a part of a log quite 
petrified, and of which good whetstones—or hones could be made.— I also 
saw where a hill had been on fire, and pumice stone around it. There is a 
great quanitity of hysop<ref target="n11041901" n="1"/> in the vallies. We killed an elk and some wild geese, 
and caught some beaver.
