Set out early this morning with a canoe and eight men in company with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.

            <note xml:id="n02111802" n="2">Since <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> entry for November 18 seems to end abruptly and the only material for November 19 consists of astronomical observations, it is difficult to determine the campsite locations for those days. The party remained in the vicinity of the <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio</name>-<name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> junction, but there is no indication of what movements they made in the interim. Since the mooring they left on the twentieth was on the <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio River</name> side of the point between the two rivers, it is probable that the camp of the previous night (November 19–20) was in <name type="place" key="Alexander County, Ill.">Alexander County</name>, <name type="place" key="Illinois">Illinois</name>, in the vicinity of <name type="place" key="Cairo, Ill.">Cairo</name>. Whether the camp of November 18–19 was in the same place, or on the "Spanish side" in <name type="place" key="Mississippi County, Mo.">Mississippi County</name>, <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>, or elsewhere, is not at all clear. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> map of the area in his Field Notes (fig. 1) shows a symbol on the <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name> shore which might be intended as a drawing of a tent; however, since it is also the point from which bearings were taken, it may signify no more than that.</note>
