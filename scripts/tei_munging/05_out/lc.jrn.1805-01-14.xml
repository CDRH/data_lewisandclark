Observed an Eclips of the Moon. I had no other glass to assist me in this observation but a small refracting telescope belonging to my sextant, which however was of considerable service, as it enabled me to define the edge of the moon's immage with much more precision that I could have done with the natural eye. The commencement of the eclips was obscured by clouds, which continued to interrupt me throughout the whole observation; to this cause is also attributable the inacuracy of the observation of the <hi rend="italic">commencement of total darkness</hi>. I do not put much confidence in the observation of the middle of the Eclips, as it is the wo[r]st point of the eclips to distinguish with accuracy. The two last observations (i. e.) the <hi rend="italic">end of total darkness</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">end of the eclips</hi>, were more satisfactory; they are as accurate as the circumstances under which I laboured would permit me to make them.—
