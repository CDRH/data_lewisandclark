As <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> complained of being unable to march far today I ordered him and <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name> to pass the rappid river near our camp and proceed at their leasure through the level bottom to a point of high timber about seven miles distant on the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name> which was in view; I gave them my pack that of <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> and the meat which we had, directing them to remain at that place untill we joined them. I took <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> with me and continued my rout up the stard. side of the river about 4 miles and then waded it; found it so rapid and shallow that it was impossible to navigate it.    continued up it on the Lard. side about 1½ miles further when the mountains put in close on both sides and arrose to great hight, partially covered with snow.    from hence the course of the river was to the East of North. I took the advantage of a high projecting spur of the mountain which with some difficulty we ascended to it's summit in about half an hour.    from this eminance I had a pleasing view of the valley through which I had passed many miles below and the continuation of the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name> through the valley equally wide above me to the distance of about 20 miles when that also appeared to enter the mountains and disappeared to my view; however the mountains which termineate the valley in this direction appears much lower than those up either of the other forks.    on the rapid fork they appeared still to rise the one range towering above another as far as I could perceive them.    the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name> as I suspected dose bear considerably to the West of South and the gap formed by it in the mountains after the valley terminates is in the same direction.    under these circumstances I did not hesitate in beleiving the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name> the most proper for us to ascend.<ref target="n18080502" n="2"/>    about South from me the <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name> approached within about 5 miles. I resolved to pass across the plains to it and return to <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>, accordingly we set out and decended the mountain among some steep and difficult precipices of rocks.    here <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> missed his step and had a very dangerous fall, he sprained one of his fingers and hirt his leg very much.    in fifteen or 20 minutes he was able to proceed and we continued our rout to the river where we had desighned to interscept it. I quenched my thirst and rested a few minutes examined the river and found it still very navigable.    an old indian road very large and plain leads up this fork, but I could see no tracks except those of horses which appeared to have passed early in the spring.    as the river mad a great bend to the South East we again ascended the high plain and steered our course as streight as we could to the point where I had directed <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name> to remain. we passed the plain regained the bottom and struck the river about 3 miles above them; by this time it was perfectly dark &amp; we hooped but could hear no tidings of them.    we had struck the river at the point of timber to which I had directed them, but [they] having mistaken a point of woods lower down, had halted short of the place.    we continued our rout after dark down the bottom through thick brush of the pulppy leafed thorn<ref target="n18080503" n="3"/> and prickly pears for about 2 hours when we arrived at their camp.<ref target="n18080504" n="4"/>    they had a small quantity of meat left which <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> and myself eat it being the first we had taisted today.    we had traveled about 25 miles. I soon laid down and slept very soundly untill morning. I saw no deer today nor any game except a few Antelopes which were very shy. the soil of the plains is a light yellow clay very meager and intermixed with a large proportion of gravel,<ref target="n18080505" n="5"/> producing nothing except the twisted or bearded grass, sedge and prickly pears.    the dryer parts of the bottoms are also much more indifferent in point of soil to those below and are covered with the southernwood pulpy leafed thorn and prickley pears with but little grass.    the moist parts are fertile and covered with fine grass and sand rushes.</p>

This morning <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> set out at sunrise and dispatched <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph</name> &amp; <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name> to hunt.    they killed two deer on one of which the party breakfasted.    the river today they found streighter and more rapid even than yesterday, and the labour and difficulty of the navigation was proportionably increased, they therefore proceeded but slowly and with great pain as the men had become very languid from working in the water and many of their feet swolen and so painfull that they could scarcely walk.    at 4 P. M. they arrived at the confluence of the two rivers where I had left the note.    this note had unfortunately been placed on a green pole which the beaver had cut and carried off together with the note; the possibility of such an occurrence never onc occurred to me when I placed it on the green pole.    this accedent deprived <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> of any information with ripect to the country and supposing that the rapid fork was most in the direction which it was proper we should pursue, or West, he took that stream and asscended it with much difficulty about a mile and encamped on an island that had been lately overflown and was yet damp;<ref target="n18080506" n="6"/> they were therefore compelled to make beds of brush to keep themselves out of the mud.    in ascending this stream for about a quarter of a mile it scattered in such a maner that they were obliged to cut a passage through the willow brush which leant over the little channels and united their tops.    <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clarks</name> ankle is extreemly painfull to him this evening; the tumor has not yet mature, he has a slight fever.—    The men were so much fortiegued today that they wished much that navigation was at an end that they might go by land.—</p>

The S W fok contains more timber than is below for Some distance,<ref target="n18080508" n="8"/> we assended this fork about one mile and Encamped on an island which had been laterly overflown &amp; was wet    we raised our bead on bushes, we passed a part of the river above the forks which was divided and Scattered thro the willows in Such a manner as to render it dificuelt to pass through for a ¼ of a mile, we were oblige to Cut our way thro' the willows—    Men much fatigued from their excessive labours in hauling the Canoes over the rapids &amp;c. verry weak being in the water all day.    my foot verry painfull</p>

Some of which was fell across by the beaver.    the currents So rapid we were oblidged to hall by the bushes, and Some places be out in the water where we could Scarsely kick our feet for the rapidity of the current.

through the willows &amp; young cotton wood    the beaver had fell Some of them across the channel and it crooked    it was with much difficulty we got thro.    obledged to forse our way through the bushes and hall by them.    Some places out in the water could Scarsely keep our feet for the rapidity of the current.    Saw Several beaver dams verry high.    night came on.    Camped on S.

it appears it has lately been higher, but is now falling a little.    was it low their would not be water enofe in it for us to proceed any further by water.    our hunter killed a deer.    Came 8 miles this day.    the party much fatigued and wish to leave the canoes &amp; go by land.</p>
               <p>
Monday August 5th    A Clear, cool morning, we set out as usual, and sent 2 of our hunters ahead in order to kill some Game for us, One of which joined us before breakfast with a deer he had killed.    The wind blew cold from the South, the Shores &amp; hills rockey &amp; the bottoms of the river, covered with small Stones, The other hunter joined us at Noon, but had not kill'd anything.    The rapids of the River, we find here, worse than any that we have yet met with; and it is with great difficulty that we can pass them, and very fataigueing to our party—    About 1 o'Clock P. M. the weather clouded up, and the wind got high.    We proceeded on about a Mile further up, &amp; 
came too.—    We halted here for a short time, &amp; then proceeded on, and came to where the River forked, We here took the right hand fork, which we found run very rapid, some of the Rapids of the River; here fell 3 feet, and 
was between 3 &amp; 4 feet in length.    We passed through a channel where we found the water run rapid through Willows &amp; Cotton wood trees, The Beaver had cut down some of those trees, which had fell across the Channel, &amp; the 
River running Crooked, it was with much difficulty we got through them, being obliged to force our Canoes through the bushes, &amp; hawl the Canoes by them.    Several of our party were forced to go out into the Water in several places, to hawl along the Canoes, and the rapidity of the Current made it very difficult for them to keep 〈on〉 their feet.—    We saw several beaver dams, which was very high; Night came on, &amp; we encamped on the South side of the River in a low bottom, which had been lately overflowed.    The fork that we are at (or rather small stream of water) is high, which we suppose is occasioned from the Water melting on the Mountains.    this River has the appearance of having been considerable higher, than it is at present, and at any common time.    we are of oppinion that there would not be water sufficient for our Canoes to proceed any futher.—</p>
               <p>
We came 8 Miles this day, &amp; encamped; our party are much fataigued, &amp; it is the wish of all of them, that we would proceed on our Voyage by land to the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>—    Our hunter joined us at our encampment, and brought with him a Deer, he had killed.—

            <note xml:id="n18080505" n="5">The Tertiary uplands near the junction of these rivers are principally composed of sand, clay, and soft sandstone. Because this area receives only about ten inches of precipitation annually, a mature soil containing a significant humus horizon cannot develop except in the bottoms. The gravel found on these uplands was deposited by the adjacent rivers when they flowed at a higher elevation than at present.</note>
