The wind blew so violently this morning that we did not think it prudent to set out untill it had in some measure abated; this did not happen untill 10 A. M. when we proceeded principally by the toe lines    the bottoms somewhat wider than usual, the lands fertile or apparently so tho' the short grass and the scantey proportion of it on the hills would indicate no great fertility.    passed <name type="place" key="Windy Island">Windy Island</name> on Lard. at 1 M.    5½ miles above passed a large Island in a bend on Stard. side, and three miles further on the same side passed the entrance of grows Creek 20 yds wide, affords but little water.<ref target="n13052201" n="1"/>    this creek we named from seeing a number of the pointed tail praire hen near it's mouth,<ref target="n13052202" n="2"/>    these are the fist we have seen in such numbers for some days. I walked on shore this morning    the country is not so broken as yesterday tho' still high and roling or wavy; the hills on Lard. side possess more pine than usual; some also on the Stard. hills. Salts and other mineral appearances as usual.    the river continues about the same width or from 200 to 250 yds. wide, fewer sandbars and the courant more gentle and regular; game not so abundant as below the <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Muscle Shell river</name>. I killed a deer in the course of my walk today. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> also walked out this evening and took a view of the country from a conspicuous point and found it the same as has been discribed.    we have caught but few fish since we left the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, they do not bite freely, what we took were the white cat of 2 to 5 lbs.<ref target="n13052203" n="3"/> I presume that fish are scarce in this part of the river. We encamped earlyer this evening<ref target="n13052204" n="4"/> than usual in order render the oil of a bear which we killed. I do not believe that the Black bear common to the lower part of this river and the Atlantic States, exists in this quarter;<ref target="n13052205" n="5"/> we have neither seen one of them nor their tracks which would be easily distinguished by it's shortness of tallons when compared with the brown grizly or white bear. I believe that it is the same species or family of bears which assumes all those colours at different ages and seasons of the year.—<ref target="n13052206" n="6"/>

The wind Continued to blow So violently hard we did not think it prudent to Set out untill it luled a little, about 10 oClock we Set out    the morning Cold, passed a Small Island in the bend to the Lard Side, &amp; proceeded on    at 5 miles higher passed a Island in a bend to the Stard Side, and a Creek a Short distance above on the Stard Side 20 yds. w    <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt Lewis</name> walked out before dinner &amp; Killed a Deer, I walked out after dinner and assended &amp; but a few miles to view the Countrey, which I found roleing &amp; of a verry rich Stickey Soil produceing but little vegitation of any kind except the prickley-piar, but little grass &amp; that verry low.    a great deal of Scattering <hi rend="italic">Pine</hi> on the Lard Side &amp; Some fur on the Stard.

               <p>
We camped on the Stard. Side, earlier than we intend on account of Saveing the oil of a bear which the party killed late this afternoon.</p>
