               <p>On April 27, 1805, the expedition left the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone River</name>
and probably passed the boundary of present-day <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name> that same
day. The courses of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> and <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> Rivers have changed
greatly in the past two centuries, leaving room for some doubt as to the exact
day the party reached what is now the eastern border of <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>. They very
soon encountered large numbers of deer, elk, bison, wolves, and grizzly bears.
They reached "<name type="place" key="Auxvasse (Big Miry, Big Muddy, Muddy) River">Martha's River</name>" (now the <name type="place" key="Auxvasse (Big Miry, Big Muddy, Muddy) River">Big Muddy River</name>) on April 29 and the
"<name type="place" key="Poplar (Porcupine) River">Porcupine River</name>" (now the <name type="place" key="Poplar (Porcupine) River">Poplar River</name>) on May 3. The <name type="place"
                        key="Milk (Ah-mâh-tâh ru-shush-sher, River Which Scolds at All Others) River">Milk River</name> was reached
on May 8 and the <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Musselshell</name> on May 20. "<name type="place" key="Judith River">Judith's River</name>" (now the <name type="place" key="Judith River">Judith River</name>)
was passed on May 29 and the mouth of "<name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's River</name>" (now simply spelled
the <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name>) on June 2, 1805.</p>
               <p>A major geographic discovery, the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the Missouri River</name>, was
reached on June 16, 1805. At that point a major portage was needed, and it was
not until July 15 that the party was able to get under way again. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>
and his small advance party reached the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name> region on July 25,where the
<name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>, <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madison</name>, and <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">Gallatin</name> Rivers (all named by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>) merge
to form the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. It was also near here that <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> had been captured
five years previously. At <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name> the expedition had reached an elevation
of slightly more than 4,000 feet and was at the very western edge of the <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great
Plains</name>. The rest of the group arrived the 17th, and after three more days of local
exploration they set off again. Following the westernmost branch (<name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson
River</name>) upstream, the expedition soon was in the heart of the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>
and about to cross the <name type="place" key="Continental Divide">Continental Divide</name>.</p>
               <p>The route of the return trip across <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name> is complicated by the fact that
the expedition split into several parties after crossing the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name> at
<name type="place" key="Lolo Pass">Lolo Pass</name>, west of present-day <name type="place" key="Missoula, Mont.">Missoula</name>. From <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name> camp (about 20
miles south of <name type="place" key="Missoula, Mont.">Missoula</name>) <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> and a group of 20 men, plus <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>
and her son, began traveling southward on July 3, progressively making their
way past the sites of present-day <name type="place" key="Hamilton, Mont.">Hamilton</name> and <name type="place" key="Jackson, Mont.">Jackson</name>. On July 8 they reached
the <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead River</name> somewhat above the location of present-day <name type="place" key="Dillon, Mont.">Dillon</name>, where
they found their cache of supplies as well as their canoes. From there they moved
downstream to <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name>, arriving July 13, 1806. Ten members of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain
Clark's</name> group were then sent via canoes from <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name> to <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>, to
begin the arduous portage around the falls and rapids.</p>

and her 17-month-old son, <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Baptiste</name>) and their horses moved overland
across <name type="place" key="Bozeman Pass">Bozeman Pass</name> and reached the upper <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone ("Rochejhone") River</name>
near the present site of <name type="place" key="Livingston, Mont.">Livingston</name> on July 15, 1806. There the trees were not large
enough to make canoes, so they continued downstream. At the approximate
site of present-day <name type="place" key="Columbus, Mont.">Columbus</name> the group stopped long enough to manufacture
two dugout canoes from cottonwoods and then resumed water travel on July
24. They gradually made their way down the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>, making a short stop
on July 25 at a sandstone promontory that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> named "<name type="place" key="Pompeys Pillar (Pompy's Tower)">Pompy's Tower</name>" in
honor of <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name> son, whom <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had nicknamed <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Pompy</name>. There <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain
Clark</name> inscribed his own name and the date. In that general vicinity they saw
a large herd of bighorns as well as flocks of geese and pigeons. They arrived at
the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> on August 3, 1806, thus finally leaving present-day
eastern <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name> and again passing into what is now western <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>.</p>
               <p>From <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name> camp, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> and his group of nine men (and
five guides) independently set forth in a northeasterly direction on July 3, 1806,
for <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>, arriving at the river after a hard march of eight days. He left six
of his party at <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> to assist <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> ten-man contingent with the downstream
portaging, and with his remaining three handpicked men headed on
July 16 for a brief reconnaissance of the <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias ("Maria's") River</name>. On their way
north, they sequentially crossed the <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Sun River ("Medicine River")</name> and the <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">Teton
River</name>. After reaching the <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> doggedly followed it northwest to a point
about 20 miles west of present-day <name type="place" key="Cut Bank, Mont.">Cut Bank</name>, along a northern tributary, <name type="place" key="Cut Bank Creek (North Branch of Marias River)">Cut
Bank Creek</name>. He was searching for the northernmost limits of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri's</name>
drainage, and thus the possible northernmost legal limits of the Louisiana Purchase.
By July 22 he was within sight of the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>, but the river had
still not turned north, and several days of bad weather had made it impossible
for him to establish his exact location. After turning back south and crossing
<name type="place"
                        key="Two Medicine River (Main or South Branch Marias River)">Two Medicine River</name> (the <name type="place"
                        key="Two Medicine River (Main or South Branch Marias River)">south fork of Maria's River</name> in <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> terminology),
the exploration ended abruptly on July 27 when eight <name type="place" key="Blackfeet Indians, Piegan">Piegan Blackfoot</name> men,
with whom they had held a peaceful council the day before, tried to steal the
group's guns and horses. In the resulting fight one <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name> man was killed
and another was evidently fatally wounded. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> himself was very narrowly
missed by a musket ball. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his men quickly retreated and again reached
the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name> near the present site of <name type="place" key="Virgelle, Mont.">Virgelle</name> on July 28. The site of this
harrowing encounter is on private land about 15 miles northeast of present-day
<name type="place" key="Valier, Mont.">Valier</name>.</p>
               <p>The group of six men who had been left by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> to negotiate the
<name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> portage was soon met by the ten others who had been sent downstream
by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> from <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name> to help with the portaging. After
negotiating the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> portage, the 16 men continued downstream. By the
greatest of good luck, they encountered <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his three-man party just as
they were returning to the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name> on July 28. The reunited
group of 20 men then descended the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> under the leadership of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain
Lewis</name>, reaching the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone River</name> and arriving at the approximate
present-day boundary of <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name> on August 7, 1806, only four days
behind <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark's</name> group that had come via the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>. Thus the last
members of the Corps of Discovery departed from what is now <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>.</p>

cliff and tree hollows, and that they often eat the fruits and seeds of the prickly
pear (<hi rend="italic">Opuntia sp</hi>.). Woodrats, more generally known as "packrats," accumulate
caches of food items such as cactus fruits, acorns, pine cones, bones, and even
inedible objects such as small plastic items and other miscellaneous "treasures"
that they happen to find in the vicinities of their nests. It is now known that
bushy-tailed woodrats extend east into the western Dakotas, and a few decades

                     <p>During the 1805 ascent up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> grizzlies were seen by expedition
members at no fewer than 17 locations, and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> also mentioned them at three
locations during his survey of the <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name> valley. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> likewise saw them at
least twice as he traveled down the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> Valley. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> referred
to grizzly bears under various names, including the "white bear," "brown bear,"
and "grizly bear." <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> eventually concluded that all these color variants
were "of the same species only differing in color from age or more properly
from the same natural cause than many other anamals of the same family differ
in coulur." The grizzly bear was not formally described and named as a distinct
species ("<hi rend="italic">Ursus ferox</hi>") until 1815, based on the descriptions and specimens of
<name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Raymond Burroughs calculated that at least 43 grizzly bears
were killed over the entire expedition period, most of them in <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>. Twenty
three were killed between the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> and <name type="place" key="Three Forks, Mont.">Three Forks</name>, <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>.
Ten were killed in the vicinity of <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> alone, and 14 were killed
during the separate return trips of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> down the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> and
<name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> Rivers of <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>. Every shooting of a grizzly was a highly risky undertaking.
One enormous 600-pound male required ten shots to bring it down.
On May 14 six men set out to kill a grizzly bear. Although all six lead balls hit the
bear, it attacked, and only after two more bullets struck it, one in the head, did
it finally collapse, just before reaching its closest human target. <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name> now
has one of the very few remaining populations of grizzly bears south of <name type="place" key="Canada">Canada</name>,

Elliott Coues identified these as most probably brown-headed cowbirds and
Brewer's blackbirds. Probable cowbirds were also seen near <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> (July 11-
13, 1805, and July 11, 1806), and this species (referred to by the explorers as the

cattle appeared on the <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>. Cowbird populations are now declining
nationally, but they still pose a serious threat to native songbirds because of their
parasitic nesting behavior. Brewer's blackbird populations have also declined

in the northern United States, as they winter in tropical America. The eastern

have been the one familiar to the explorers and would not have attracted special
attention. Also, it is more often found closer to water than the more arid-adapted
western species. Kingbirds of undetermined species were also noted

descriptions of the species, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> calling it the "prarie cock" and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>
the "cock of the plains." <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> also first described the species' unusual saclike
gizzard, describing it as more like a "maw" (crop) than a typical muscular grinding
organ. He said this grouse feeds almost entirely on the "pulpy leafed thorn,"
presumably confusing the relatively inedible black greasewood with the bird's
actual primary (almost sole) food, the highly nutritious leaves of big sagebrush
(<hi rend="italic">Artemisia tridentata</hi>). John J. Audubon used <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's'</name> suggested name "cock of
the plains" when he painted the species about three decades later. Greater sage-grouse
populations have plummeted in recent decades, as the West's once-vast

when in <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name> the expedition members "killed and preserved several." He then

instead believed that it might have been an upland sandpiper. Either species
would be geographically possible, but the sandpiper, which is somewhat more
curlewlike than the plover and is more widespread, would seem the more likely
possibility. Descriptive terms such as curlew (spelled variously) and plover were
evidently used rather indiscriminately for shorebirds by expedition members,
with curlew perhaps usually applied to the longer-billed or larger species. Too
little information is available to make an informed guess as to the identity of this
particular bird. The mountain plover's population has declined to the point that
it is now a federally endangered species, whereas the population of the upland
sandpiper has increased slightly during the past four decades, one of the very

                     <p>A snake that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> found and described on July 23, 1805, near

The western hognose snake was not formally described until 1852, so <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>
should be credited with discovering the species. It is mildly venomous and has
a somewhat frightening, cobralike defensive display. Its distinctive upturned
snout is used for digging in sand, where it searches for toads and other prey.</p>

the blue catfish is on average considerably larger than the channel catfish, the

reach 30 pounds. Nine catfish caught near the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Vermillion (White Stone) River (S. Dak.)">Vermillion River</name> on

Native Americans for various ailments. Cottonwood trees were also extremely
important to the success of the entire expedition, inasmuch as their fairly soft
wood and the large size of the mature trees occurring along river edges made
them excellent candidates for manufacturing dugout canoes. Ten of the 15 dugout
canoes the expedition members constructed were made from cottonwoods,
the others from ponderosa pine (<hi rend="italic">Pinus ponderosa</hi>).</p>
