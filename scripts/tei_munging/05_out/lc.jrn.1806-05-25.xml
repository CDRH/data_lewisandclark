It rained the greater part of last night and continued untill 6 A. M. our grass tent is impervious to the rain.    the Child is more unwell than yesterday.    we gave it a doze of creem of tartar which did not operate, we therefore gave it a clyster<ref target="n35052501" n="1"/> in the evening.    we caused a sweat to be prepared for the indian Cheif in the same manner in which <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> had been sweated, this we attempted but were unable to succeed, as he was unable to set up or be supported in the place.    we informed the indians that we knew of no releif for him except sweating him in their sweat houses and giving him a plenty of the tea of the horsemint which we shewed them.    and that this would probably nos succeed as he had been so long in his present situation. I am confident that this would be an excellent subject for electricity and much regret that I have it not in my power to supply it.—<ref target="n35052502" n="2"/>

                        key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Lewis's river</name>.    he saw several salmon in their lodges which they informed him came from that river    these fish were remarkably fat and fine. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> and <name type="person" key="Shields, John">shields</name> returned this evening having killed a Sandhill Crain only.    they had wounded a female bear and a deer but got neither of them. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> informed me that the bear had two cubbs one of which was white and other as black as jett.    four indians remained with us this evening.—

rained moderately the greater part of last night and this morning untill 6 A. M. The child is not So well to day as yesterday. I repeeted the Creem of tarter and the onion poltice. I caused a Swet to be prepared for the Indn. in the Same hole which <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">bratten</name> had been Sweten in two days past <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>
                  <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiech</name> and <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Peter crusatt</name> Set out hunting towards the <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">quarmash grounds</name> if they can cross the Creek which is between this and that place, which has been the bearrer as yet to our hunters. <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Jos.</name> &amp; <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R Fields</name> crossed the river to hunt on the opposit side. <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name> went to the 2d village to purchase roots a fiew of which he precured.    he informed us that only 8 persons remained in the Village.    the men were either hunting on <name type="place"
                        key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Lewis's river</name> fishing, &amp; the women out digging roots.    he saw Several fresh Salmon which the nativs informed him Came from <name type="place"
                        key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Lewis's river</name> and were fat and fine.    one of our men purchased a Bear Skin of the nativs which was nearly of a Cream Coloured white.    this Skin which was the Skin of an animal of the middle Size of bears together with the defferent Sizes colours &amp;c. of those which have been killed by our hunters give me a Stronger evidence of the various Coloured bear of this country being one Species only, than any I have heretofore had.    the poil of these bear were infinately longer finer &amp; thicker than the black bear    their tallons also longer &amp; more blunt as worn by digging roots. the white redish brown and bey Coloured bear I saw together on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; the bey &amp; Grizly have been Seen and killed together here.    for these were the Colours of those which <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> killed on the 14th inst.    in short it is not common to find two bear here of this Species presisely of the same colour, and if we were to attempt to distinguish them by their colours and to denomonate each colour a distinct Species we Should Soon find at least twenty.    〈Some〉 the most Strikeing difference between this Species of bear and the Common black bear are that the former are large and have longer tallens, hair, and tushes, prey more on other animals, do not lie so long or so closely in winter quarters, and will not Climb a tree, tho' ever so hardly pursued.    the varigated bear I believe to be the Same here with those of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> but these are not so ferocious as those on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> perhaps from the Circumstance of their being compeled from the scercity of game in this quarter to live more on roots and of course not so much in the habit of Seizing and debowering liveing animals.    the bear here is far from being as passive as the common black bear, they have atacked and fought our hunters already but not so feircely as those of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. There are also some of the Common black bear in this neghbourhood tho no So Comon as the other Species.</p>

we attempted to swet the sick indian but could not Suckceed.    he was not able either to Set up or be Supported in the place prepared for him. I therefore deturmined to inform the Nativs that nothing but Sefere Swetts would restore this disabled man, and even that doubtfull in his present Situation.    in the evening <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name> &amp; <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">gibson</name> returned haveing killed a Sandhill Crane only.    they Saw a female bear, &amp; 2 Cubs &amp; Several deer.    they Shot the bear and a deer both of which made their escape. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> told me that the Cubs were of different Colours one jut black and the other of a whiteish Colour—.    4 indians Continue with us, one return to their village to daey

                  <hi rend="italic">Sunday 25th.</hi>    There was a cloudy morning, and some light showers of rain fell. Five more hunters went out to day. In the evening yesterday two of the natives brought an Indian<ref target="n35052505" n="5"/> to our camp, who had lost the use of his limbs, to see if the officers could cure him, and to day we gave him a sweat.— Our <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">interpreter's child</name>
                  <ref target="n35052506" n="6"/> has been very sick, but he is getting better. In the afternoon the two hunters who went out yesterday returned; but had not killed any thing. The weather became clear and we had a fine evening, and three more hunters<ref target="n35052507" n="7"/> went out.
