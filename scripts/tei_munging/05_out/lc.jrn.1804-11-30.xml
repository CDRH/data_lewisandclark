               <p>
I told this nation that we Should be always willing and ready to defend them from the insults of any nation who would dare to Come to doe them injurey dureing the time we would 〈Stay〉 remain in their neighbourhood, and requstd. that they would inform us of any party who may at any time be discovered by their Patroles or Scouts;</p>
               <p>
I was Sorry that the Snow in the Plains had fallen So Deep Sence the Murder of the young Chief by the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Scioux</name> as prevented, their horses from traveling    I wished to meet those <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Scioux</name> &amp; all others who will not open their ears, but make war on our dutiful!

                  </hi> (or <name type="native_nation" key="Assiniboine Indians">Stone</name> Inds.) because if you go to war with those people, they will provent the traders in the north from bringing you Guns Powder &amp; Ball and by that means distress you verry much, but whin you will have Certain Suppliers from your Great American father of all those articls you will not Suffer any nation to insult you &amp;c.    after about two hours conversation on various Subjects all of which tended towards their Situation &amp;c. I informed them I Should return to the fort, the Chief Said they all thanked me verry much for the fatherly protection which I Showed towards them, that the Village had been Crying all the night and day for the death of the brave young man, who fell but now they would wipe away their tears, and rejoice in their fathers protection—and Cry no more—</p>
               <p>
I then Paraded &amp; Crossed the river on the ice and Came down on the N. Side    the Snow So deep, it was verry fatigueing    arrved at the fort after night, gave a little Taffee,<ref target="n08113005" n="5"/> [<hi rend="italic">NB: dram to my party</hi>]    a Cold night    the river rise to its former hite—    The Chief frequently thanked me for Comeing to protect them—    and the whole Village appeared thankfull for that measure
