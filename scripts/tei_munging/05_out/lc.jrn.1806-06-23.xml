                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 23rd.</hi>    We had again a fine morning; and the men went out to hunt. While they were out the two Indians went on. About 11 o'clock the hunters came in without having killed any thing; and at noon two men<ref target="n36062306" n="6"/> came to our camp with orders for four of us to follow the Indians, if they were gone, until we should overtake them, and get them to halt if possible, till the party should come up; but if not, to follow them on and blaze the way after them; as the man<ref target="n36062307" n="7"/> who had gone to enquire for a guide had not returned, and it was not known whether he would get one or not. The men said they had had good luck at the <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">Com-mas flat</name>, having killed ten deer and three bears. I immediately started with three of the men after the Indians, leaving one to take care of the camp, and the lame horse and some more that were there. We proceeded on till we came to the creek<ref target="n36062308" n="8"/> where we had stayed the 19th and 20th, and overtook the Indians encamped there, and encamped with them.</p>
               <p>
They had caught two salmon-trout since they came to this camp; and shortly after we came one of our men killed a duck; and we remained together during the night.
