Sunday 7th Sept. 1806.    a pleasant morning.    the party Set out eairly leaving me with my canoe to wait for the [hunters]    we waited untill abt. 10 A. M. then hearing a blunderbuss fired a head as a Signal that the hunters were a head. So we Set out and followed on    the wind So high that we could
Scarsely proced.    about 2 oClock P. M. we overtook the party who had halted to hunt as the wind was So high.    the Hunters killed 4 Elk and caught three large catfish which was fat.    towards evening the wind abated So that we procd. on untill after Sunset and Camped on a sand beach.    the Musquetoes not So troublesome as they have been for a long time past.

About 9 o'clock we met with our hunters, but they had not killed any thing; and at 11 halted to hunt and wait for the canoe. In a short time we killed three elk and brought in the meat; and the canoe having come up we proceeded on, and at sunset encamped. The musketoes are not so troublesome as they were some time ago.
