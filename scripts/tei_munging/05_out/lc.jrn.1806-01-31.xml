Sent a party of eight men<ref target="n28013101" n="1"/> up the river this morning to renew their surch for the Elk and also to hunt; they proceded but a few miles before they found the river so obstructed with ice that they were obliged to return. <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> arrived this evening, informed us that he had been hunting in company with <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> for the last five days in order to obtain some meat for himself and the other Salt makers, and that he had been unsuccessfull untill yesday evening when he had fortunately killed two Elk, about six miles distant from this place and about 8 from the <name type="place" key="Saltmaking Camp (Oreg.)">salt works</name>; he left <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> to dry the meat of these Elk and had come for the assistance of some men to carry the meat to the <name type="place" key="Saltmaking Camp (Oreg.)">salt camp</name>; for this purpose we ordered four men to accompany him early in the morning.    discovered that <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name> had the pox, gave him medecine. <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> found a bird<ref target="n28013102" n="2"/> dead lying near the fort this morning and brought it to me    I immediately recognized it to be of the same kind of that which I had seen in the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name> on the morning of the 20th of September last.    this bird is about the size as near as may be of the robbin.    it's contour also is precisely the same with that bird.    it measures one foot 3¼ Inches from tip to tip of the wings when extended.    9¼ inches from the extremity of the beak to that of the tail.    the tail is 3¾ inches in length, and composed of eleven feathers of the same length. The beak is smoth, black, convex and cultrated; one and ⅛ inches from the point to the opening of the chaps and ¾ only uncovered with feathers; the upper chap exceeds the other a little in length.    a few small black hairs garnish the sides of the base of the upper chap.    the eye is of a uniform deep sea green or black, moderately large.    it's legs feet and tallons are white; the legs are an inch and a ¼ in length and smoth; four toes on each foot, of which that in front is the same length with the leg including the length of the tallon, which is 4 lines;<ref target="n28013103" n="3"/> the three remaining toes are ¾ of an inch, each armed with proportionably long tallons.    the toes are slightly imbricated.    the tallons are curved and sharply pointed. The crown of the head from the beak back to the neck, the back of the neck imbracing reather more than half the circumpherence of the neck, the back and tale, are of bluish dark brown; the two outer feathers of the tale have a little dash of white near their tips not percemtible when the tail is foalded.    a fine black forms the ground of the wings; two stripes of the same colour pass on either side of the head from the base of the beak along the side of the head to it's junction with the neck, and imbraces the eye to it's upper edge; a third stripe of the same colour ¾ of an inch in width passes from the sides of the neck just above the butts of the wings across the croop in the form of a gorget.<ref target="n28013104" n="4"/>    the throat or under part of the neck brest and belly is of a fine yellowish brick red.    a narrow stripe of this colour also commences just above the center of each eye, and extends backwards to the neck as far as the black stripe reaches before discribed, to which, it appears to answer as a border.    the feathers which form the 1st and second ranges of the coverts of the two joints of the wing next the body, are beautifully tiped with this brick red; as is also each large feathre of the wing on the short side of it's plumage for ½ an inch in length commening at the extremity of the feathers which form the first or main covert of the wing.    this is a beatifull little bird.    I have never heard it's note it appears to be silent.<ref target="n28013105" n="5"/>    it feeds on berries, and I beleive is a rare bird even in this country, or at least this is the second time only that I have seen it.—    between the legs of this bird the feathers are white, and those which form the tuft underneath the tail are a mixture of white and a brick red.—</p>

The beak is Smoth, black, convex and cultrated; 1⅛ inches from the point to the opening of the Chaps and ¾ only uncovered with feathers, the upper Chap exceeds the other a little in length.    a fiew Small black hairs garnish the Side of the upper chap. The Eye is of a uniform deep Sea green or black, moderatley large.    it's legs feet and tallants are white; the legs are of 1¼ in length and Smoth; four toes on each foot, of which that in front is the Same length of the leg including the tallants, which is 4 lines; the 3 remaining toes are ¾ of an inch, each armed with proportionably large tallons.    the toes are Slightly imbricated.    the tallons are curved and Sharply pointed. The Crown of the head from the beak back to the neck imbracing rather more than half the circumphrence of the neck, the Back and tail is of a bluish dark brown; the two outer feathers of the tail have a little dash of white near the tips, not proceivable when the tail is foalded.    a fine black forms the ground of the wings; two Stripes of the same colour passes on either side of the Head from the base of the Back along the Side of the head to it's junction with the neck, and embraces the eye to its upper edge; a third Stripe of the Same Colour ¾ of an inch in width passes from the Side of the neck just above the buts of the wings across the croop in the form of a gorget.    the throat or under part of the neck brest and belly is of a fine Yellowish brick red.    a narrow Stripe of this Colour also Commences just above the center of each eye, and extends backwards to the Neck as far as the black Spots reaches before discribed, to which it appears to answer as a border.  the feathers which form the 1st and Second range of the coverts of the two joints of the wings next the body are butifully tiped with this Brick red; as is also each large feather of the wing on the Short Side of its plumage for 1/2 an inch in length Comencing at the extremity of the feather which form the first or main Covert of the wing. This is a butifull little bird.
