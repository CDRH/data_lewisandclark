Wednesday 11th Sept. 1805.    a clear pleasant morning.    we went out to look up our horses.    the Latidude at this place is 46° 48° 28s 8/10 North.    we did not find all our horses untill afternoon.    about 4 oClock P. M. we Set out and proceeded on up this creek<ref target="n22091106" n="6"/>    course nearly west.    the narrow bottoms on this Creek is thinly covred with pitch pine    passed a large tree on which the natives had a number of Immages drawn on it with paint.    a part of a white bear skin hund on Sd. tree.    we came about 7 miles this evening and Camped on a narrow plain near where had been a large Camp of Indians a Short time past. Saw one lodge made of Earth.    the pine trees pealed for some distance around.    the natives eat the enside bark.

Lewis</name> had a meridian altitude that gave 46° 48 28.8 north latitude. In the bottoms here, there are a great quantity of cherries. The mountains are not so high, as at some distance back. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the horse was found, and we proceeded on up the creek nearly a west course, through small bottoms. We went about 6 miles and encamped when our hunters came in but had killed nothing. The country is poor and mountainous.

Wednesday Septemr—. 11th    A Beautiful pleasant morning, and we all turned out to hunt up our horses, but they were so scattered, that we did not find them all untill 12 o'Clock A. M.    We dined here and our Officers ascertained the Latitude of this place which they found to lay in 46° 48' 288/10 S North Latitude and named this place <hi rend="italic">

               <p>
We proceeded on up this large Creek nearly a West course, where we found the narrow bottoms along the Creek mostly covered with Pine timber; and passed by a Pine Tree on which a number of figures were painted 〈on it〉, &amp; a White Bearskin hanging on the same tree, the figures were painted by the Natives &amp; the White bear Skin, were placed there also by them.    We suppose this place to be a place of Worship among them.    We came about 7 Miles this evening, and encamped on a smooth plain, near the Creek that we had left &amp; where there had lately been an encampment (which was large) of Indians.    We saw one encampment here made out of Earth &amp; the Pine trees, pealed as high up as a Man could reach, which we suppose the Natives had done in order to get the inside bark, for to mix with their dried fruit to eat; it being the manner in which they prepare it—    We found the Wild or Choke Cherries plenty at this place.—
