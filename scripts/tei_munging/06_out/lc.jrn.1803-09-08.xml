8th    this day wrote to the President,<ref target="n02090801" n="1"/> purchased a perogue and hired a man to work her, my men were much fatiegued and I concluded it would be better to give them a days rest and let them wash their clothes and exchange their flour for bread or bake their bread in a better manner than they had the means of baking it while traveling; dined with <name type="person" key="Rodney, Thomas">Colo. Rodney</name> and his suit, in the evening they walked down to my boat and partook of some watermellons. I here also met with <name type="person" key="Patterson, William Ewing">Dr. Patterson</name>
                  <ref target="n02090802" n="2"/> the son of the professor of mathematicks in the University of <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philada</name>.    he expressed a great desire to go with me    I consented provided he could get ready by three the next evening    he thought he could and instantly set about it; I told the Dr. that I had a letter of appointment for a second Lieut. which I could give him but did not feel myself altogether at liberty to use it as it was given me by the President to be used in the event of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Mr. Clark's</name> not consenting to go with me but as he had I could not use it without the previous consent of the President; however if he thought proper to go on with me to the <name type="place" key="Illinois">Illinois</name>
                  <ref target="n02090803" n="3"/> where I expected to winter I could obtain an answer from the President by the spring of the year or before the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missourie</name> would be sufficiently open to admitt of my asscending it; and that in the event of the President's not consenting to our wishes, I concieved that the situation of that country was a much more elligible one for a phisician than that of <name type="place" key="Wheeling, W. Va.">Wheeling</name> particularly as he stated the practice which he had acquired at <name type="place" key="Wheeling, W. Va.">Wheeling</name> was not an object: the Dr. was to have taken his medicine with him which was a small as sortment of about 100 L value. remained here all night—    The people began to top their corn and collect their fodder—
