The moring was cloudy and a few drops of rain. Set out at an early hour and proceeded as usual by the help of our chords.    the river Clifts and bluffs not so high as yesterday and the country becomes more level.    a <ref target="n14060101" n="1">mountain or a part of the N. Mountain appears to approach the river within 8 or 10 ms. bearing N. from our encampment of the last evening.</ref> Capt C. who walked on shore today informed me that the river hills were much lower than usual and that from the tops of those hills he had a delightfull view of rich level and extensive plains on both sides of the river; in those plains, which in many places reach the river clifts, he observed <ref target="n14060102" n="2">large banks of pure sand which appeared to have been d[r]iven by the S W. winds from the river bluffs and there deposited.</ref>    the plains are more fertile at some distance from the river than near the bluffs where the surface of the earth is very generally covered with <ref target="n14060103" n="3">small smothe pebbles which have the appearance of having been woarn by the agitation of the waters in which they were no doubt once immerced.</ref> A <ref target="n14060104" n="4">range of high Mountains appear to the S. W. at a considerable distance covered with snow, they appear to run Westerly.</ref> no timber appears on the highlands; but much more than yesterday on the river and Islands.    rockey points and shoals less freequent than yesterday but some of them quite as bad when they did occur.    the river from 2 to 400 yards wide, courant more gentle and still becoming clearer.    game is by no means as abundant as
below; we killed one male bighorn and a mule deer today; saw buffalow at a distance in the plains particularly near a small Lake on Lard. side about 8 ms. distant.    some few drops of rain again fell this evening.    we passed six Islands and <ref target="n14060105" n="5">encamped on the 7th;</ref> they are all small but contain some timber.    the wind has been against us all day.—    <ref target="n14060106" n="6">I saw the choke cherry the yellow and red courant bushes; the wild rose appears now to be in full bloom as are also the prickley pear which are numerous in these plains.—</ref>    We also saw some Indian Lodges of sticks today which did not appear to have been long evacuated.—    some coal appear in the bluffs.</p>

a Cloudy morning    we Set out at an early hour and proseeded on as usial with the toe rope    The Countrey appears to be lower and the Clifts not So high or Common, a mountain or a part of the <name type="place" key="Little Rocky (North) Mountains">north Mountain</name> about 8 or 10 miles N. of this place, I walked on Shore to day found the 〈high〉 Plains much lower than we have Seen them and on the top we behold an extencive plain on both Sides, in this plain I observed maney [<hi rend="italic">X: k</hi>]noles of fine Sand which <ref target="n14060109" n="9">appeared to have blown from the river bluffs and collected at these points</ref>    Those plains are fertile    near the river a great no. of Small Stone, I observed at Some distance to the S. W. a high mountain which appears to bear westerly    The Cole appear as usial, more Cotton trees Scattered on the Shores &amp; Islands than yesterday—    no timber on the high land, the river from 2 to 400 yards wide &amp; current more jentle than yesterday but fiew bad rapid points to day— the wild animals not So plenty as below    we only killed a ram &amp; mule Deer to day, we Saw Buffalow at a distance in the plains, particularly near a Lake on the Lard. Side about 8 miles distant from the river—    We passed Six Islands and encamped on the 7th    all those Islands are Small but contain Some timber on them    The river riseing a little    Wind to day from the S. W.    Som fiew drops of rain in the morning and also in the evening, flying Clouds all day</p>

Yesterday our men killed three of them, that had remarkable large horns; one pair weighed 25 pounds.
