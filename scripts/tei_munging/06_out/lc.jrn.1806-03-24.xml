This morning we sent out a party of 15, at light,<ref target="n31032401" n="1"/> for the meat, and concluded to take breakfast before we set out.    they soon returned.    we breakfasted and set out at ½ after 9 A. M. Saw a white woodpecker with a red head of the small kind common to the United States;<ref target="n31032402" n="2"/> this bird has but lately returned.    they do not remain during the winter.    the country thick and heavily timbered.    we saw very few waterfowl today, not a single swan, white brant nor a small goose is to be seen.    a few Cormorant, duckinmallard, butterbox, and common large geese were only to be found.<ref target="n31032403" n="3"/>    the tide being out this morning we found some difficulty in passing through the bay below the <name type="native_nation" key="Cathlamet Indians">Cathlahmah</name> village;<ref target="n31032404" n="4"/> this side of the river is very shallow to the distance of 4 miles from the shore tho' there is a channel sufficient for canoes near S. side.    at 1 P. M. we arrived at the <name type="native_nation" key="Cathlamet Indians">Cathlahmah</name> village where we halted and purchased some wappetoe,<ref target="n31032405" n="5"/> a dog for the sick, and a hat for one of the men.    on one of the <name type="place" key="Karlson (Seal) Island">seal Islands</name>
                  <ref target="n31032406" n="6"/> opposite to the village of these people thy have scaffolded their dead in canoes elivating them above tidewater mark.    these people are very fond of sculpture in wood of which they exhibit a variety of specemines about their houses.    the broad peices supporting the center of the roof and those through which the doors are cut, seem to be the peices on which they most display their taist. I saw some of these which represented human figures setting and supporting the burthen on their sholders.    at half after 3 P. M. we set out and continued our rout among the <name type="place" key="Karlson (Seal) Island">seal Islands</name>; not paying much attention we mistook our rout which an Indian perceiving pursued overtook us and put us in the wright channel.    this <name type="native_nation" key="Cathlamet Indians">Cathlahmah</name> claimed the small canoe which we had taken from the <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop County, Oreg.">Clatsops</name>.    however he consented very willingly to take an Elk's skin for it which I directed should be given him and he immediately returned.    we continued our rout along the South side of the river and encamped at an old village of 9 houses opposite to the lower <name type="native_nation" key="Wahkiakum Indians">Wackkiacum</name> village.<ref target="n31032407" n="7"/>    the night was cold tho' wood was abundant after dark two <name type="native_nation" key="Chinook Indians">Chinnook</name> men came to us in a small canoe.    they remained with us all night.    came 15 miles today.

Monday March 24th    This morning early, Our officers sent 15 of our party out, in order to bring in the Meat of the 2 Elk, which our hunters had killed; that party returned &amp; brought it in with them, about 8 O'Clock A. M.    At half past 9 o clock A.

the deceased Indian.
