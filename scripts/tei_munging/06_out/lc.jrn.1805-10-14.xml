Monday October 14th    A Clear cold morning, the Wind blowing hard from the Westward, We took an early breakfast and proceeded on our Voyage as usual, We found the current to run mostly rapid.    About noon we went down a very bad Rockey rapid, it being the worst rapid that we had passed in this River.    Three of our canoes ran a solid rock &amp; stuck fast.    This was at the head of a rapid.    Two of these canoes were fast at the same 
time, and had nearly been lost.    the other Canoe struck the same rock, &amp; got fast in the middle of the fall, however with great exertion our Men got them afloat again &amp; brought them safe over these falls, &amp; got 〈brought〉  
them safe down to a small Island lying near the South side of the River, which Island lay still in the rapids.    We continued on a small distance below this Island, where we halted to dine.—    We have since we set out this morning, constantly saw two Indians riding down along the bank of the River, who had to ride fast to keep up with us.—    We left this Island at 1 o'Clock P. M. and proceed on down the River about 8 Miles very well, We then came to a 
Rockey rapid, which lay at the head of an Island, in passing through this rapid, one of our Canoes, that was in the charge of <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Serjeant Ordway</name> ran fast on a solid rock, and swung across it.    The Men that was on board this canoe all got out of her into the water on the rock, &amp; attempted to shove her off, but could not for some time start her.    The Water all this while dashed over the bow of this Canoe, &amp; when they got her loose she filled with water &amp; a considerable quantity of baggage &amp; bedding washed out.    One of our Canoes that was a small distance below where this accident happened, unloaded and went to their assistance; and took out some of the loading.—    The Canoe that was on the rock then broke away from the Men, &amp; left 4 Men standing on the Rock in the Water half leg deep over the smooth rocks &amp; rapids.    One of our Canoes went in a short time to their assistance &amp; took these Men from off the Rock on board of it.    We saved some part of that Canoes loading &amp; lost a small brass kettle, Buffalo robes, blanketts, Spoons shot pouches &amp; powder horns, dressed Elk Skins, a bag of Root bread &amp;ca.    We encamped on an Island lying below the Rapids &amp; put out all the wet baggage to dry.    We found on the Island, some Wood that was covered up with Stones, which the Natives had buried.    The Natives come to this place to fish in the Spring of the Year.    We made use of the Wood that we had found, to dress our Victuals with.    We came about 25 Miles this day,    The land continues to be a Barren &amp; in many places broken &amp; high smooth plains.—    In the Evening one of our Men killed 8 Ducks which he got.    our Course still continues West.—
