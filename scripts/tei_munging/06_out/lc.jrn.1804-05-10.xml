            <note xml:id="n03051001" n="1">The Corps of Discovery had at least fifteen of the new Model 1803 rifles, the first ones issued; this weapon, the first rifle specifically designed for the U.S. Army, was about .54 caliber with a thirty-three-inch barrel, but the expedition version may have been a predecessor or prototype differing in some respects from the standard issue. The captains sometimes referred to them as short rifles, because they were considerably shorter than the civilian Kentucky long rifles of the period. The captains apparently had their own Kentucky long rifles, and some of the enlisted men who were already in the army may have brought with them long rifles of the Kentucky type issued to them in their original units. Other enlisted men apparently carried Model 1795 muskets, .69-caliber weapons based on an earlier French design, which were the standard infantry arms. The muskets, which were smoothbores, could be used as shotguns by substituting shot for the single ball. All of these guns were flintlocks. Olson identifies what may possibly be a surviving Model 1803. Russell (GEF), 151–57, 176–82; Russell (FTT), 34–43; Olson; Hult; Lewis's List [June 30, 1803], Jackson (LLC), 1:70.</note>
