The wind was more moderate this morning, tho' still hard; we set out at an early hour.    the water friezed on the oars this morning as the men rowed.    about 10 oclock A. M. the wind began to blow so violently that we were obliged to lye too.    my dog had been absent during the last night, and I was fearfull we had lost him altogether, however, much to my satisfaction he joined us at 8 Oclock this morning. The wind had been so unfavorable to our progress for several days past, and seeing but little prospect of a favourable chang; knowing that the river was crooked, from the report of the hunters who were out yesterday, and  beleiving that we were at no very great distance from the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellow stone River</name>; I determined, in order as mush as possible to avoid detention, to proceed by land with a few men to the entrance of that river and make the necessary observations to determine it's position, which I hoped to effect by the time that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> could arrive with the party; accordingly I set out at 11 OCk. on the Lard. side, accompanyed by four men.<ref target="n11042501" n="1"/>    we proceeded about four miles, when falling in with some buffaloe I killed a yearling calf, which was in good order; we soon cooked and made a hearty meal of a part of it, and renewed our march    our rout lay along the foot of the river hills.    when we had proceeded about four miles, I ascended the hills from whence I had a most pleasing view of the country, perticularly of the wide and fertile vallies formed by the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name> and the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone</name> rivers, which occasionally unmasked by the wood on their borders disclose their meanderings for many miles in their passage through these delightfull tracts of country. I could not discover the junction of the rivers immediately, they being concealed by the woods, however, sensible that it could not be distant I determined to encamp on the bank of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellow stone river</name> which made it's appearance about 2 miles South of me.    the whol face of the country was covered with herds of Buffaloe, Elk &amp; Antelopes; deer are also abundant, but keep themselves more concealed in the woodland.    the buffaloe Elk and Antelope are so gentle that we pass near them while feeding, without apearing to excite any alarm among them, and when we attract their attention, they frequently approach us more nearly to discover what we are, and in some instances pursue us a considerable distance apparenly with that view.—    in our way to the place I had determined to encamp, we met with two large herds of buffaloe, of which we killed three cows and a calf.    two of the former, wer but lean, we therefore took their tongues and a part of their marrow-bones only. I then proceeded to the place of our encampment with two of the men, taking with us the Calf and marrowbones, while the other two remained, with orders to dress the cow that was in tolerable order, and hang the meat out of the reach of the wolves, a precaution indispensible to it's safe keeping, even for a night.    we encamped on the bank of the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">yellowstone river</name>, 2 miles South of it's confluence with the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.—<ref target="n11042502" n="2"/>    On rejoining <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, the 26th in the evening, he informed me, that at 5 P. M. after I left him the wind abated in some measure and he proceeded a few miles further and encamped.<ref target="n11042503" n="3"/>

I remarked, as a singular circumstance, that there is no dew in this Country, and very little rain. Can it be owing to the want of timber?
