               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had reached the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks of the
        Missouri</name>, which they named the 
        <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>, the 
        <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madison</name>, and the 
        <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">Gallatin</name>, on July
        27, 1805. Beyond lay the major obstacle in their journey to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>, the passage over the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>to some navigable tributary
        of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>. To make this trip they
        needed the assistance of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone Indians</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name>people, and although they had seen
        signs indicating the presence of these people, none of them had yet appeared.</p>
            <p>What 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>hoped to find was the "pyramidal
        height of land," the point from which, geographical theorists believed, the great rivers
        of the West flowed toward the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>, the 
        <name type="place" key="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</name>, and the 
        <name type="place" key="California, Gulf of">Gulf of California</name>. It would be, in
        1805, the closest thing still possible to the Northwest passage that so many mariners had
        yearned and searched for, that 
        <name type="person" key="Cook, James">James Cook</name>had sought less than thirty years
        before, and that 
        <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Alexander Mackenzie</name>had failed to
        find in the previous decade but had thought might exist somewhere in the continent. The
        information supplied by the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>suggested there might yet
        be an easy portage to the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>headwaters.</p>
            <p>The captains decided to proceed up the 
        <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>, the
        westernmost fork, with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>going ahead with a few men to
        search for the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, unable to do much walking because
        of illness and a bad boil on his ankle, would command the main party in the canoes. The
        passage of the canoes became increasingly difficult as the streams became more shallow and
        unnavigable because of rapids. Much of the time the men had to draw the canoes along by
        hand, wading in the water. The party moved on up the 
        <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>and then
        its main tributary, the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>proceeded ahead, past the forks of
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>and such
        landmarks as 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead Rock">Beaverhead Rock</name>. He left a message for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to take the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead River</name>instead of
        the west fork, which they named 
        <name type="place" key="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River">Wisdom River</name>(today's 
        <name type="place" key="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River">Big Hole River</name>), but a
        beaver chewed down the pole on which he left the message and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>took the wrong fork, causing another
        day's delay.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was amazed that the rivers
        penetrated so far into the mountains while still being navigable, but he knew that this
        situation would not long continue. On August 10 he reached the forks of the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead River</name>and followed
        the western fork into the valley the captains later called "
        <name type="place" key="Shoshone Cove">Shoshone Cove</name>." The next day, following an
        Indian trail, the advance party came upon a 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>on horseback. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>tried to convince him by signs
        that they were friend, but the Indian evidently feared they were 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>raiders and fled.</p>
            <p>On August 12 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and his three men continued
        following Indian paths up later 
        <name type="place" key="Trail (Glade) Creek">Trail Creek</name>. At the head of that
        stream they reached what they considered the source of the "heretofore deemed endless 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>." A short distance beyond was the
        ridge of the 
        <name type="place" key="Continental Divide">Continental Divide</name>. From this vantage
        point 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>could look west and and see
        further ranges of mountains—proof that the portage to the waters of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>would not be as easy as he had
        hoped. His immediate problem, however, remained that of making friendly contact with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>party had crossed 
        <name type="place" key="Lemhi Pass">Lemhi Pass</name>into 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, the first U.S. citizens to traverse the 
        <name type="place" key="Continental Divide">Continental Divide</name>. On August 13 they
        continued down into the valley of the 
        <name type="place" key="Lemhi (East Fork Lewis's) River">Lemhi River</name>, still
        following the Indian trail. Once again they encountered some Indians, who fled at their
        approach. Finally they found a woman and two girls who did not see them until they were
        quite close. One of the girls fled, but the woman and the other girl apparently thought it
        was too late to run and sat waiting for the strangers to kill them. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>took the woman's hand, repeating
        the word "
        <hi rend="italic">ta-ba-bone,</hi>" which he evidently obtained from 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>and which he thought meant "white
        man." He rolled up his sleeve to show his white skin and gave the two 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>presents. Somehow he
        calmed them and, through 
        <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard's</name>sign language,
        persuaded them to call back the girl who had fled before she could raise an alarm in the
        main 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>camp.</p>
            <p>Through these three 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was able to make contact with
        their people who were camped on the 
        <name type="place" key="Lemhi (East Fork Lewis's) River">Lemhi River</name>. The chief, 
        <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name>, seemed friendly, but his people
        were still afraid that the strangers were in league with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>and would betray them
        into the hands of their enemies. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, trying to persuade them to go
        with him to meet 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party on the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead River</name>, feared that
        they would take alarm and disperse into the mountains, where he knew that he would never
        find them, and that his command would be left stranded in the mountains with winter coming
        on. To prevent this he used every form of persuasion he could think of, including promises
        that white traders would follow him and would provide the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>with trade goods, such
        as guns to use against their enemies. He gave the chief his own gun, saying that 
        <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name>could shoot him if he proved
        unfaithful. Recovering a message he himself had left at the forks of 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">the Beaverhead</name>for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, he stalled for time, saying it was
        a message from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>that the main party would soon be
        there. These means, along with stories about a man with black skin and another with red
        hair—wonders that greatly intrigued the Indians—persuaded them to wait at the forks until 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party arrived on August 17. Such
        was the captains' relief that they called the campsite at the forks of the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead</name>"
        <name type="place" key="Camp Fortunate (Mont.)">Camp Fortunate</name>."</p>
            <p>Geographical information obtained from the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>was not encouraging. A
        reconnaissance by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>confirmed that the principal streams
        in the vicinity, though they did flow toward the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, were unnavigable because of
        rapids. The only alternative was to obtain horses from the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>and cross the mountains
        by land. Fortunately, they secured the services of an Indian they called "
        <name type="person" key="Old Toby">Old Toby</name>," who knew of a route over the ranges.
        The latter part of August and much of September would be consumed by the overland trek,
        which would take them back into 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>, then back to 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, and would include a journey over the rugged 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>. Along the way they met the 
        <name type="place" key="Flathead Indians">Flathead Indians</name>, another tribe who had
        never seen white men.</p>
            <p>The trip over the 
        <name type="place" key="Bitterroot (Snow) Mountains">Bitterroot Mountains</name>via the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>was perhaps the severest test of the
        whole expedition. Winter was already beginning in the high country in September, and the
        party would struggle through deepening snow. Lack of game forced them to kill and eat some
        of their horses. Pack animals slipped and fell down steep mountainsides. 
        <name type="person" key="Old Toby">Old Toby</name>misled them at one point, costing even
        more time. Finally the captains decided to adopt their old procedure of sending one of the
        officers ahead with a small party to find open country and make contact with friendly
        Indians. Accordingly, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>set out with six men on September 18
        and two days later reached 
        <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">Weippe
        Prairie</name>, an open area in west-central 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, where he was the first white man to meet the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce Indians</name>. The long and
        difficult trip from mountain pass to meadows dashed all hope of a short portage across the
        
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>and ended dreams of an easy
        passage to the Orient.</p>
            <p>The Indians offered the party roots to eat, but the food proved a mixed blessing, for
        it caused indigestion and diarrhea among most of the Corps' men. In spite of their
        suffering they established a camp on the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater
        River</name>and began building dugout canoes for the trip to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>. On October 7 they were ready to
        start out, leaving their horses with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>to await their
        return.</p>
            <p>The 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater</name>flows
        into the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>and
        the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>into
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. Following these streams, the
        Corps passed out of the mountains down to the 
        <name type="place" key="Great Columbian Plain">Great Columbian Plain</name>. The party had
        traveled through a variety of ecosystems previously unknown to Anglo-Americans. From the 
        <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>, semi-arid and largely treeless
        yet teeming with game, they had entered the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>, the first
        English-speaking whites to do so with the exception of 
        <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Alexander Mackenzie's</name>Canadian party
        to the north of a few years earlier. In the mountains they found a region heavily wooded
        in many places, where the game necessary for sustenance was scarce and the natives often
        lived on the edge of starvation. Even so, they encountered unfamiliar species at every
        turn. They saw the birds that would bear the captains' names, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>woodpecker and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>nutcracker. They were the first
        whites on record to examine the hide and horns of the mountain goat, and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>caught a distant sight of one,
        although the party would never obtain a full specimen. In traversing the mountains they
        saw new trees such as grand fir and lodgepole pine. On the western side of the mountains
        they found the camas root, a vital element in the diet of tribes like the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>. Their own diet
        shifted drastically as they passed from the abundance of buffalo and elk on the plains to
        the scarcity of the mountains. They supplemented the increasingly scarce deer with roots
        and with the flesh of their own horses. The changes sometimes had drastic effects on their
        health.</p>
            <p>Coming down to the 
        <name type="place" key="Great Columbian Plain">Columbia Plain</name>, they again entered a
        new world, barren of trees like the 
        <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>but also barren of game. They
        shifted from an area inhabited by horseback tribes who hunted on the plains east of the
        mountains to tribes who traveled by canoe and subsisted on salmon and roots. They were
        able to observe the end of the great salmon run on the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, the numbers of which 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>found "incredible to say." The
        steelhead trout appeared near the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">falls of the Columbia</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>thought he saw a sea otter, but this
        mammal never leaves salt water and the creature sighted was probably the harbor seal,
        another species new to Anglo-Americans.</p>
            <p>The captains had expected to find rapids and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">falls on the Columbia</name>,
        and they did. They reached the 
        <name type="place" key="Celilo (Great) Falls">Celilo, or Great, Falls</name>on October 22,
        and beyond them lay the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)">
        Cascades</name>, passing through the mountain range of the same name. They portaged some
        of these obstacles and, to save time, ran through some others, lowering the canoes with
        elkskin ropes. Beyond the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)">
        Cascades</name>lay the final run to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Coast">Pacific Coast</name>, which they had come so far to
        reach.</p>
