This morning we had all our horses brought up and indeavoured to exchange five or shix with the Indians in consequence of their having unsound backs but succeeded in exchanging one only. <name type="person" key="Hohots Ilppilp">Hohâstillpilp</name> with several of the natives who visited us yesterday took leave of us and set out for the plains near <name type="place"
