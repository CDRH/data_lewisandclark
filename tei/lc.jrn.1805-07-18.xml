               <p>Set out early this morning.    previous to our departure saw a large herd
          of the Bighorned anamals on the immencely high and nearly perpendicular clift opposite
          to us;
          <ref target="n17071801" n="1"/>on the face of this clift they walked about and bounded
          from rock to rock with apparent unconcern where it appared to me that no quadruped could
          have stood, and from which had they made one false step the[y] must have been
          precipitated at least a 500 feet.    this anamal appears to frequent such
          precepices and clifts where in fact they are perfectly secure from the pursuit of the
          wolf, bear, or even man himself.—    at the distance of 2½ miles we passed the
          entrance of a considerable river on the Stard. side; about 80 yds. wide being nearly as
          wide as the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>at that place.    it's
          current is rapid and water extreamly transparent; the bed is formed of small smooth
          stones of flat rounded or other figures.    it's bottoms are narrow but
          possess as much timber as the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    the country is
          mountainous and broken through which it passes.    it appears as if it might
          be navigated but to what extent must be conjectural.    this handsome bold and
          clear stream we named in honour of the Secretary of war calling it 
          <ref target="n17071802" n="2">
                     <name type="place" key="Dearborn River">Dearborn's river</name>.—</ref>   as
          we were anxious now to meet with the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Sosonees</name>
                  <ref target="n17071803" n="3"/>or 
          <name type="place" key="Shoshone Indians">snake Indians</name>as soon as possible in
          order to obtain information relative to the geography of the country and also if
          necessary, some horses we thought it better for one of us either 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>or myself to take a small party
          &amp; proceed on up the river, some distance before the canoes, in order to discover
          them, should they be on the river before the daily discharge of our guns, which was
          necessary in procuring subsistence for the party, should allarm and cause them to
          retreat to the mountains and conceal themselves, supposing us to be their enemies who
          visit them usually by the way of this river.    accordingly 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>set out this morning after
          breakfast with 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Pots</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="York">his servant York</name>.    we proceeded on
          tolerably well; the current stonger than yesterday we employ the cord and oars
          principally tho' sometimes the setting pole.    in the evening we passed a
          large creek about 30 yds. wide which disembogues on the Stard. side; it discharges a
          bold current of water it's banks low and bed frormed of stones altogether; this stream
          we called 
          <name type="place" key="Little Prickly Pear (Ordway's) Creek">Ordway's creek</name>after
          
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. John Ordway</name>.
          <ref target="n17071804" n="4"/>I have observed for several days a species of flax
          <ref target="n17071805" n="5"/>growing in the river bottoms the leaf stem and pericarp
          of which resembles the common flax cultivated in the U' States.    the stem
          rises to the hight of about 2½ or 3 feet high; as many as 8 or ten of which proceede
          from the same root.    the root appears to be perennial.    the bark
          of the stem is thick strong and appears as if it would make excellent flax.   
          the seed are not yet ripe but I hope to have an opportunity of collecting some of them
          after they are so    if it should on experiment prove to yeald good flax and
          at the same time admit of being cut without injuring the perennial root it will be a
          most valuable plant, and I think there is the greatest probability that it will do so,
          for notwithstanding the seed have not yet arrived at maturity it is puting up suckers or
          young shoots from the same root and would seem therefore that those which are fully
          grown and which are in the proper stage of vegitation to produce the best fax are not
          longer essencial to the preservation or support of the root.    the river
          somewhat wider than yesterday and the mountains more distant from the river and not so
          high; the bottoms are but narrow and little or no timber near the river.   
          some pine on the mountains which seems principally confined to their uper region.
             we killed one Elk this morning and found part of the flesh and the skin of
          a deer this evening which had been kiled and left by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>.    we saw several
          herds of the Bighorn but they were all out of our reach on inacessable clifts.—
             we encamped on the lard. side in a small grove of narrow leafed cottonwood.
          <ref target="n17071806" n="6"/>   there is not any of the broad leafed
          cottonwood on the river since it has entered the mountains. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>ascended the river on the
          Stard. side.
          <ref target="n17071807" n="7"/>   in the early part of the day after he left
          me the hills were so steep that he gained but little off us; in the evening he passed
          over a mountain by which means he cut off many miles of the river's circuitous rout; the
          Indian road which he pursued over this mountain is wide and appears as if it had been
          cut down or dug in many places; he passed two streams of water, the branches of 
          <name type="place" key="Little Prickly Pear (Ordway's) Creek">Ordway's creek</name>, on
          which he saw a number of beaver dams succeeding each other in close order and extending
          as far up those streams as he could discover them in their couse towards the mountains.
             he also saw many bighorn anamals on the clifts of the mountains.
             not far beyond the mountain which he passed in the evening he encamped on a
          small stream of runing water.    having travelled about 20 m.    the
          water of those rivulets which make down from these mountains is extreemly cold pure and
          fine.    the soil near the river is of a good quality and produces a luxuriant
          growth of grass and weeds; among the last the sunflower holds a distinguished place.
             the aspin is small but grows very commonly on the river and small streams
          which make down from the Mouts.</p>

               <p>a fine morning    passed a Considerable river which falls in on the Stard

             we thought it prudent for a partey to go a head for fear our fireing Should
          allarm the Indians and cause them to leave the river and take to the mountains for Safty
          from their enemes who visit them thro this rout. I deturmined to go a head with a Small

          So Hilley that we gained but little of the Canoes untill in the evening I passed over a

          the River, the roade which passes this mountain is wide and appears to have been dug in
          maney places, we Camped on a Small run of Clear Cold water, musquitors verry troublesom
          the forepart of the evening    I Saw great maney Ibex.    we Crossed
          two Streams of running water
          <ref target="n17071810" n="10"/>on those Streams I saw Several Beaver dams.

             we Saw Mountain Sheep or Ibex on the top of a high Steep pricipice.
             they ran along the rocks where it was all most perpentickelier and about
          200 feet from the Surface of the water.    we set out at sun rise and

                  <hi rend="italic">Thursday 18th.</hi>   The morning was fair and we proceeded
          on early: passed 
          <name type="place" key="Dearborn River">Clear-water river</name>on the north side about
          50 yards wide, rapid and shallow. There are a great quantity of currants
          <ref target="n17071814" n="14"/>all along the river on both sides in the small bottoms.
          At breakfast time Captain 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke</name>with three men went on ahead.
          About 11 we got through the higher part of the mountains, and to where there is less
          timber and the rocks not so large. In the forenoon we passed two small creeks on the
          north side,
          <ref target="n17071815" n="15"/>and in the afternoon a small river on the same side;
          above the mouth of which we got a deer skin, that Captain

             we Saw Some Mountain Sheep on a verry high precipice which is nearly Steep
          from the river up 2 or 3 100 feet.    we Set out about Sun rise and proceded
          on about 3 miles    passed the mouth of a River about 100 yd. wide at the

          evening we passed a Small River on N. S. about 60 yds wide named [
          <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] River.    the mountains continue but not So high
          as yesterday.    we Came 19½ miles and Camped in a narrow bottom on the S.
          Side.    considerable of flax in this bottom half Seded.    we took
          on board Some deer meat &amp; a Skin which

               <p>Thursday July 18th    This morning clear &amp; pleasant; we saw some
          Mountain Sheep (Ibex) on a very high Precipice, which is nearly steep from the River,
          and 〈nearly〉 about 300 feet high, We set out about Sun rise, and proceeded on our way,
          and about 3 Miles from the place we left this morning, we passed the Mouth of a River,
          about 100 Yards wide at its mouth called 
          <name type="place" key="Smith River">Smiths River</name>, it came in on the North side

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>kill'd one of them, We got
          near to them before they ran from us, The mountains appear not to be so high a head of
          us, as those we are in at present, We saw another range of Mountains a long distance
          further above us, Which appear to be much higher, than any that we have seen in this
          range, (some of which are 700 feet high)    The Pitch &amp; Yellow pine appear
          to be growing, Scattering along these Mountains

          travel, up the River by land to make discoveries.—    We continued on our
          Voyage with our Canoes, till towards evening, and passed a small River lying on the
          North side 60 Yards wide at its mouth which

          Mountains continue, but not so high as they was Yesterday, We came 19½ Miles this day,
          and encamped in a narrow bottom, lying on the South side of the River; here we found
          growing considerable quantity's of wild Flax, having seed about half ripe, This flax was
          in every appearance like the Flax, which is planted &amp; grows in the United States.
             We found hanging up at this place the Meat &amp; Skin of a deer, that
