               <p>last evening the indians entertained us with seting the fir trees on fire.
             they have a great number of dry lims near their bodies which when set on
          fire creates a very suddon and immence blaze from bottom to top of those tall trees.
             they are a beatifull object in this situation at night. this exhibition
          reminded me of a display of fireworks.    the natives told us that their
          object in seting those trees on fire was to bring fair weather for our journey.— We
          collected our horses readily and set out at an early hour this morning.    one
          of our guides complained of being unwell, a symptom which I did not much like as such
          complaints with an indian is generally the prelude to his abandoning any enterprize with
          which he is not well pleased.    we left them at our encampment and they
          promised to pursue us in a few hours.    at 11 A. M. we arrived at the branch
          of 
          <name type="place" key="Hungery Creek">hungary creek</name>where we found 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R.</name>&amp; 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Feilds</name>.    they had not
          killed anything.    here we halted and dined and our guides overtook us.
             at this place I met with a plant
          <ref target="n36062501" n="1"/>the root of which the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">shoshones</name>eat.    it
          is a small knob root a good deel in flavor an consistency like the Jerusalem Artichoke.
             it has two small oval smooth leaves placed opposite on either side of the
          peduncle just above the root.    the scape is only about 4 inches long is
          round and smooth.    the roots of this plant formed one of those collections
          of roots which 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>took from the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>last summer on the
          head of 
          <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson's
          river</name>.    after dinner we continued our rout to 
          <name type="place" key="Hungery Creek">hungary Creek</name>and encamped about one and a
          half miles below our encampment of the 16th inst.—
          <ref target="n36062502" n="2"/>   the indians continued with us and I beleive
          are disposed to be faithfull to their engagement. I gave the sik indian a buffaloe robe
          he having no other covering except his mockersons and a dressed Elkskin without the
          hair. 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and
