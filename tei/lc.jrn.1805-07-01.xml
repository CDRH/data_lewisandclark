               <p>This morning I set 
          <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>to sewing the leather on
          the sides of the sections of the boat; 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>to collect and split light wood
          and prepare a pit to make tar. 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gas</name>I set at work to make the way strips
          out of some willow limbs which tho' indifferent were the best which could be obtained. 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and myself completed the
          opperation of rendering the tallow; we obtained about 100 lbs.    by evening
          the skins were all attatched to their sections and I returned them again to the water.
             all matters were now in readiness to commence the opperation of puting the
          parts of the boat together in the morning.    the way strips are not yet ready
          but will be done in time as I have obtained the necessary timber.    the
          difficulty in obtaining the necessary materials has retarded my operations in forming
          this boat extreemly tedious and troublesome; and as it was a novel peice of machinism to
          all who were employed my constant attention was necessary to every part of the work;
          this together with the duties of cheif cook has kept me pretty well employed.
             at 3 P. M. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>arrived with the party all
          very much fortiegued.    he brought with him all the baggage except what he
          had deposited yesterday at the six mile stake, for which the party were too much
          fortiegued to return this evening.    we gave them a dram and suffered them to
          rest from their labours this evening. I directed 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>to assist in making the tar
          tomorrow, and scelected several others to assist in puting the boat together.
             the day has been warm and the Musquetoes troublesome of course   
          the bear were about our camp all last night, we have therefore determined to beat up
          their quarters tomorrow, and kill them or drive them from their haunts about this
          place.</p>
