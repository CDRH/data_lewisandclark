               <p>This morning early we passed over and formed a camp on the point formed by the junction of the two large rivers.<ref target="n14060301" n="1"/>    here in the course of the day I continued my observations as are above stated. An interesting question was now to be determined; which of these rivers was the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, or that river which the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name> call <hi rend="italic">Amahte Arz zha</hi>
                  <ref target="n14060302" n="2"/> or <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, and which they had discribed to us as approaching very near to the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>.    to mistake the stream at this period of the season, two months of the traveling season having now elapsed, and to ascend such stream to the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky Mountain</name> or perhaps much further before we could inform ourselves whether it did approach the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name> or not, and then be obliged to return and take the other stream would not only loose us the whole of this season but would probably so dishearten the party that it might defeat the expedition altogether.    convinced we were that the utmost circumspection and caution was necessary in deciding on the stream to be taken.    to this end an investigation of both streams was the first thing to be done; to learn their widths, debths, comparitive rappidity of their courants and thence the comparitive bodies of water furnished by each; accordingly we dispatched two light canoes with three men in each up those streams;<ref target="n14060303" n="3"/> we also sent out several small parties by land with instructions to penetrate the country as far as they conveniently can permiting themselves time to return this evening and indeavour if possible to discover the distant bearing of those rivers by ascending the rising grounds.    between the time of my A. M. and meridian <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C</name> &amp; myself stroled out to the top of the hights in the fork of these rivers from whence we had an extensive and most inchanting view; the country in every derection around us was one vast plain in which innumerable herds of Buffalow were seen attended by their shepperds the wolves; the solatary antelope which now had their young were distributed over it's face; some herds of Elk were also seen; the verdure perfectly cloathed the ground, the weather was pleasent and fair; to the South we saw a range of lofty mountains which we supposed to be a continuation of the <name type="place" key="Highwood (South) Mountains">S. Mountains</name>, streching themselves from S. E. to N. W. terminating abbrubtly about S. West from us; these were partially covered with snow; behind these Mountains and at a great distance, a second and more lofty range of mountains appeared to strech across the country in the same direction with the others, reaching from West, to the N of N. W., where their snowey tops lost themselves beneath the horizon.    this last range was perfectly covered with snow.<ref target="n14060304" n="4"/> the direction of the rivers could be seen but little way, soon loosing the break of their channels, to our view, in the common plain.    on our return to camp we boar a little to the left and discovered a handsome little river<ref target="n14060305" n="5"/> falling into the N. fork on Lard. side about 1½ ms. above our camp.    this little river has as much timber in it's bottoms as either of the larger streams. there are a great number of prickley pears in these plains; the Choke cherry grows here in abundance both in the river bottoms and in the steep ravenes along the river bluffs.    saw the yellow and red courants, not yet ripe; also the goosberry which begins to ripen; the wild rose which grows here in great abundance in the bottoms of all these rivers is now in full bloom, and adds not a little to the beaty of the cenery.<ref target="n14060306" n="6"/>    we took the width of the two rivers, found the left hand or S. fork 372 yards and the N. fork 200. The noth fork is deeper than the other but it's courant not so swift; it's waters run in the same boiling and roling manner which has uniformly characterized the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> throughout it's whole course so far; it's waters are of a whitish brown colour very thick and terbid, also characteristic of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; while the <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name> is perfectly transparent runds very rappid but with a smoth unriffled surface it's bottom composed of round and flat smooth stones like most rivers issuing from a mountainous country.    the bed of the N. fork composed of some gravel but principally mud; in short the air &amp; character of this river is so precisely that of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name> below that the party with very few exceptions have already pronounced the N. fork to be the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; myself and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> not quite so precipitate have not yet decided but if we were to give our opinions I believe we should be in the minority, certain it is that <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">the North fork</name> gives the colouring matter and character which is retained from hence to the <name type="place" key="Gulf of Mexico">gulph of Mexico</name>. I am confident that this river rises in and passes a great distance through an open plain country    I expect that it has some of it's souces on the Eastern side of the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountain</name> South of the <name type="place" key="Saskatchewan River">Saskashawan</name>, but that it dose not penetrate the first range of these Mountains and that much the greater part of it's sources are in a northwardly direction towards the lower and middle parts of the <name type="place" key="Saskatchewan River">Saskashawan</name> in the open plains.    convinced I am that if it penetrated the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name> to any great distance it's waters would be clearer unless it should run an immence distance indeed after leaving those mountains through these level plains in order to acquire it's turbid hue.    what astonishes us a little is that the Indians who appeared to be so well acquainted with the geography of this country should not have mentioned this river on wright hand if it be not the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; <hi rend="italic">the river that scolds at all others,</hi> as they call it if there is in reallity such an one, ought agreeably to their account, to have fallen in a considerable distance below, and on the other hand if this righthand or N. fork be the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> I am equally astonished at their not menioning the S. fork which they must have passed in order to get to those large falls which they mention on 〈that〉 the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    thus have our cogitating faculties been busily employed all day.<ref target="n14060307" n="7"/>
               </p>
               <p>
Those who have remained at camp today have been busily engaged in dressing skins for cloathing, notwithstanding that many of them have their feet so mangled and bruised with the stones and rough ground over which they passed barefoot, that they can scarcely walk or stand; at least it is with great pain they do either.    for some days past they were unable to wear their mockersons; they have fallen off considerably, but notwithstanding the difficulties past, or those which seem now to mennace us, they still remain perfectly cheerfull. In the evening the parties whom we had sent out returned agreeably to instructions. The parties who had been sent up the rivers in canoes informed that they ascended some disance and had then left their canoes and walked up the rivers a considerable distance further barely leaving themselves time to return; <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">the North fork</name> was not so rappid as the other and afforded the easiest navigation of course; Six [<hi rend="italic">NB: 7</hi>] feet appeared to be the shallowest water of the <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">S. Branch</name> and 5 feet that of the N. Their accounts were by no means satisfactory nor did the information we acquired bring us nigher to the decision of our question or determine us which stream to take. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergt.
