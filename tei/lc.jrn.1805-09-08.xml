          halted and they all came in, having killed an elk and a deer. At 2 we proceeded on
          again, and had a cold, wet and disagreeable afternoon, but our road or way was level
          along the valley. Having travelled 20 miles, we encamped and our hunters came in, one

          River.    passed over Smooth dry plains.    no timber only along the
          River, which is large pitch pine    the bottoms wide.    we crossed
          Several creeks.    Saw Snow on the Mountains to our left.    high

             the Snow lays thick on the mot. a little to our left.    we
          delayed and let our horses feed about 2 hours, and proceeded on down the valley.
             had Several Small cold Showers of rain &amp; a little hail.   
          passed over level Smooth plains in this valley.    the Mountains are rough on
          each Side and are covered with pine and the tops of which are covered with Snow.
             Some places appear to lay thick.    one of our hunters found
          &amp; caught 2 horses and a handsom Colt.    we take them along with us though
          the horses are lame.    we expect that to be the reason that the natives left
          them in these bottoms.    we travveled 20 odd miles this day and Camped at the
          Creek and Smooth bottom where was fine feed for our horses.    our hunters all
          joined us    one of them had killed a Deer.    crossed Several
          branches in course of the day.—</p>
               <p>Sunday Septemr. 8th    A cold chilly Cloudy morning.    We set
          out early and proceeded on our Journey.—    We went down this large Creek or
          small River, we passed over smooth dry plains, but no timber to be seen excepting what
          grew along the Creek, which were large Pitch Pine trees.—    The bottom land
          along this large Creek were wide &amp; the Soil very rich.—    We crossed
          several small Creeks, which made into the large Creek which we left this morning.—
             We saw Snow lying on Mountains, which lay to the South of us, &amp; high
          Barren hills, which lay to the North likewise of us.—    About 11 o'Clock A.
          M. we halted to dine at a Creek.—    Our hunters all joined us here, they had
          killed an Elk &amp; one Deer, which they brought to us.    The Wind has been
          from the N West during this day &amp; the Air chilly &amp; Cold.—    The Snow
          still continues on the Mountains, a small distance to the South of us.    We
          delayed about 2 hours to let our horses feed, we then proceeded on down the Valley &amp;
          had several small showers of rain accompanied with hail.—    We passed over
          level smooth plains in this Valley, the Mountains on each side of which, are rough, and
          are cover'd with Pine Trees, the Tops of which are Covered with Snow &amp; the snow
          appears to lay thick in many places on these Mountains.—    One of our hunters
          came across 2 Strange horses &amp; a Colt, which he caught.—    We took those
          horses &amp; Colt along with us, the horses were lame &amp; we expected that the Natives
          had left them in this Valley, on that account.    We came 25 Miles this day as
          near as we can guess, and encamped at a Creek, on a smooth bottom of land.   
          We found here fine food for our horses.    Our hunters joined us in the
          Evening.    They had killed only one deer which they brought to us.—</p>
