               <p>The men who were sent in surch of the canoe returned without being able to find her,
          we therefore give her over as lost. This morning sent out 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and one man to hunt, they
          returned in the evening, 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>having killed seven Elk; I
          scarcely know how we should subsist were it not for the exertions of this excellet
          hunter. At 2 P. M. the ballance of the party who had been left by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>arrived; about the same time the
          two hunters also arrived who had been dispatched by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt C.</name>for the purpose of hunting on the
          9th inst.; they had killed nothing. We have heretofore usually divided the meat when
          first killed among the four messes into which we have divided our party leaving to each
          the care of preserving and the discretion of using it, but we find that they make such
          prodigal use of it when they hapen to have a tolerable stock on hand that we have
          determined to adapt a different system with our present stock of seven Elk; this is to
          jerk it &amp; issue it to them in small quantities.—</p>

          scercely know how we Should Subsist, I beleive but badly if it was not for the exertions
          of this excellent hunter; maney others also exert themselves, but not being accquainted
          with the best method of finding and killing the elk and no other wild animals is to be
          found in this quarter, they are unsucksessfull in their exertions.    at 2 P.
          M 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Serjt. Gass</name>and the men I left to assist
          the Salt makers in Carrying in their meat arrived also the hunters which I directed to
          hunt in the point, they killed nothing—.    We have heretofore devided the
          meat when first killed among the four messes, into which we have divided our party,
          leaveing to each the Care of preserving and distribution of useing it; but we find that
