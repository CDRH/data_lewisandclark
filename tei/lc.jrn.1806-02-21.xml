          <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clatsop</name>who remained with us all
          day; they are great begers; I gave one of them a few nedles with which he appeared much
          gratifyed.    in the evening late they departed.

          <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>had discovered yesterday; but it
          rained so hard that they could not pursue them by their tracks and returned
          unsuccessfull. 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>saw a 
          <hi rend="italic">fisher</hi>black fox [
          <hi rend="italic">EC: Mustela pennanti</hi>] but it escaped from him among the fallen
          timber. 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>returned with the party from
          the salt camp which we have now evacuated.    they brought with them the salt
          and eutensils.    our stock of salt is now about 20 Gallons; 12 gallons of
          which we secured in 2 small iron bound kegs and laid by for our voyage.

               <p>The tyger Cat is found on the borders of the plains and in the woody country lying
          along the 
          <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>.    this animal is
          about the size or reather larger than the wild cat of our country and is much the same
          in form, agility and ferosity.    the colour of the back neck and sides is a
          redish brown irregularly variegated with small spots of dark brown the tail is about two
          inches long nearly white except the extremity which is black; it terminates abruptly as
          if it had been cut off.    the belly is white with small black spots,
          beautifully variagated.    the legs are of the same colour with the sides and
          back marked with transverse stripes of black    the ears are black on the
          outer side covered with fine short hair except at the upper point which furnished with a
          pensil of fine, streight, black hair, ¾ of an inch in length.    the fur of
          this anamal is long and fine, much more so than the wild cat of the United States but
          less so than that of Louservea of the N. West.    the natives in this quarter
          make great use of the skins of this Cat to form the robes which they wear; four skins is
          the compliment usuly employed in each robe.    the 
          <hi rend="italic">Black-fox,</hi>or as they most frequently called in the neighbourhood
          of 
          <name type="place" key="Detroit, Mich.">Detroit</name>, 
          <hi rend="italic">Fisher</hi>is found in the woody country on this coast.   
          how this animal obtained the name of fisher I know not, but certain it is, that the name
          is not appropriate, as it dose not prey on fish or seek it as a prey.    they
          are extreemly active strong and prepared for climbing, which they do with great agility,
          and bound from tree to tree in pursuit of the squirrel or Rackoon their natural and most
          usual food.    their colour is a jut black except a small spot of white on the
          breast.    the body is long, legs short and formed something like the ternspit
          dog with a remarkable long tail.    it dose not differ here from those of the
          United States. The 
          <hi rend="italic">Silver fox</hi>   this animal is very rare even in the
          country where it exists; I have never seen more than the Skins of this anamal and those
          were in the possession of the natives of the woody Country below the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">great falls of the
          Columbia</name>from which I think that it is most probably the inhabtant of the woody
          country exclusively.    from the skin it appeared to be about the size of the
          large red fox of the plains and much of it's form with a large tail.    the
          legs I think somewhat longer.    it has a fine long deep fur poil.
             the poil is of a dark lead colour and the long hairs intermixed with it are
          either white or black at the lower part and white at the top, the whole mixture forming
          a beatifull silver grey. I think this the most beautifull of all the Foxes except
          species of which I saw one only on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>near the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, White Cliffs of the">
                     <hi rend="italic">natural walls.</hi>
                  </name>   the large red fox of the plains and the Kit fox are the same which
          we met with on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and are the inhabitants almost
          exclusively of the open plains, or of the cops of brush within the pain country. The
          common red fox of the United States is also found in the woody country on this coast nor
          dose it appear to be altered in rispect to it's fur colour or any other particular</p>
