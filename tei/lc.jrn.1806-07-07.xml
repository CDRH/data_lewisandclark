               <p>This morning our horses were very much Scattered; I Sent out men in every direction
          in Serch of them.    they brought all except 9 by 6 oClock and informed me
          that they could not find those 9: I then ordered 6 men to take horses and go different
          directions and at a greater distance    those men all returned by 10 A. M. and
          informed me that they had circles in every direction to 6 or 8 miles around Camp and
          could not See any Signs of them, that they had reasons to believe that the indians had
          Stolen them in the course of the night, and founded their reasons on the quallity of the
          horses, all being the most valuable horses we had, and Several of them so attached to
          horses of inferior quallity which we have they could not be Seperated from each other
          when driveing with their loads on in the course of the day. I thought it probable that
          they might be stolen by Some Skulking 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>, but as it was yet
          possible that they may have taken our back rout or rambled to a greater distance I
          deturmined to leave a Small party and hunt for them to day, and proceed on with the main
          party and all the baggage to the Canoes, raise them out of the water and expose them to
          the sun to dry by the time this party Should overtake me. I left

          Mountains, and prosue our trail &amp;c.    at ½ past 10 A M I set out and
          proceeded on through an open rich vally crossing four large Creeks
          <ref target="n37070710" n="10"/>with extensive low and mirey bottoms, and a Small river
          <ref target="n37070711" n="11"/>keeping the Course I had set out on S. 56° E
             after crossing the river I kept up on the N E. side, Sometimes following an
          old road which frequently disappeared, at the distance of 16 miles we arrived at a
          Boiling Spring
          <ref target="n37070712" n="12"/>Situated about 100 paces from a large Easterly fork of
          the Small river in a leavel open vally plain and nearly opposit &amp; E. of the 3 forks

          <name type="place" key="Bitterroot (Snow) Mountains">Snowey Mountains</name>to the S E.
          &amp; S W of the Springs.    this Spring [

          contains a very considerable quantity of water, and actually blubbers with heat for 20
          paces below where it rises.    it has every appearance of boiling, too hot for
          a man to endure his hand in it 3 seconds. I directt

          <ref target="n37070713" n="13"/>   after takeing dininer and letting our
          horses graize 1 hour and a half we proceeded on Crossed this easterly branch and up on
          the N. Side of this middle fork 9 miles crossed it near the head of an Easterly branch
          and passed through a gap of a mountain on the Easterly Side of which we encamped near
          some butifull [

                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 7th.</hi>   We had a wet night, and a cloudy morning.
          Continued our journey early along the valley, which is very beautiful, with a great deal
          of clover in its plains. Having gone about five miles, we crossed the main branch of the
          river,
          <ref target="n37070718" n="18"/>which comes in from the north; and up which the road
          goes about five miles further and then takes over a hill towards the east.
          <ref target="n37070719" n="19"/>On the top of this hill there are two beautiful ponds,
          <ref target="n37070720" n="20"/>of about three acres in size. We passed over the ridge
          and struck a small stream,
          <ref target="n37070721" n="21"/>which we at first thought was of the head waters of the
          
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, but found it was not. Here we
          halted for dinner, and after staying three hours, we proceeded on four miles up the
          branch, when we came to the dividing ridge between the waters of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>; passed over the ridge and came

          <ref target="n37070722" n="22"/>We then kept down this stream or branch about a mile;
          then turned a north course along the side of the dividing ridge for eight miles, passing
          a number of small streams or branches, and at 9 o'clock at night encamped
          <ref target="n37070723" n="23"/>after coming thirty two miles.</p>
