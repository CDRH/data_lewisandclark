               <p>This morning I sent over several men for the meat which was killed yesterday, a few
          hours after they returned with it, the wolves had not discovered it. I also dispatched

          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">the Indian woman</name>was much better this morning
             she walked out and gathered a considerable quantity of the white apples of
          which she eat so heartily in their raw state, together with a considerable quantity of
          dryed fish without my knowledge that she complained very much and her fever again
          returned. I rebuked 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name>severely for suffering
          her to indulge herself with such food he being privy to it and having been previously
          told what she must only eat. I now gave her broken dozes of diluted nitre

          of laudnum which gave her a tolerable nights rest. I amused myself in fishing several
          hours today and caught a number of both species of the white fish,
          <ref target="n15061902" n="2"/>but no trout nor Cat. I employed the men in making up
          our baggage in proper packages for transportation; and waxed the stoppers of my powder

          greased.    in the evening the men mended their mockersons and prepared
          themselves for the portage. After dark my dog barked very much and seemed extreemly
          uneasy which was unusual with him; I ordered the sergt. of the guard to reconniter with
          two men, thinking it possible that some Indians might be about to pay us a visit, or
          perhaps a white bear; he returned soon after &amp; reported that he believed the dog had
          been baying a buffaloe bull which had attempted to swim the river just above our camp
          but had been beten down by the stream landed a little below our camp on the same side

               <p>We went on the Island to hunt the White bear this morning but Could not find him,
          after plotting my Courses &amp;c. I deturmined to dry the meat we killed and leave here,
          and proceed up the river as far as it bent to the S. E. and examine a Small Creek above
          our Camp, I Set out and found the Creek only Contained back water for 1 mile up, assend

          the party to examine the best ground for the portage, the little Creek has verry
          extencive bottoms which Spread out into a varriety of leavl rich bottoms quite to the
          mountains to the East, between those bottoms is hills low and Stoney on this declivity
          where it is Steep. I returned to Camp late and deturmined that the best nearest and most
          eassy rout would be from the lower part of the 3rd or white bear Island, the wind all
          this day blew violently hard from the S W. off the
