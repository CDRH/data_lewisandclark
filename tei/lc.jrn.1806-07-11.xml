               <p>the morning was fair and the plains looked beatifull    the grass much
          improved by the late rain.    the air was pleasant and a vast assemblage of
          little birds which croud to the groves on the river sung most enchantingly.   
          we set out early. I sent the hunters down 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medicine
          river</name>to hunt Elk and proceeded with the party across the plain to the 
          <name type="place" key="White Bear Islands">white bear Islands</name>which I found to be
          8 ms. distant    my course S. 75 E.— through a level beautifull and extensive
          high plain covered with immence hirds of buffaloe.—    it is now the season at
          which the buffaloe begin to coppelate and the bulls keep a tremendious roaring we could
          hear them for many miles and there are such numbers of them that there is one continual
          roar.    our horses had not been acquainted with the buffaloe they appeared
          much allarmed at their appearance and bellowing.    when I arrived in sight of
          the 
          <name type="place" key="White Bear Islands">whitebear Islands</name>
                  <ref target="n37071101" n="1"/>the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name>bottoms on both sides of the
          river were crouded with buffaloe    I sincerely belief that there were not
          less than 10 thousand buffaloe within a circle of 2 miles arround that place. I met with
          the hunters at a little grove of timber opposite to the island where they had killed a
          cow
          <ref target="n37071102" n="2"/>and were waiting our arrival.    they had met
          with no elk. I directed the hunters to kill some buffaloe as well for the benefit of
          their skins to enable us to pass the river as for their meat for the men I meant to
          leave at this place.    we unloaded our horses and encamped opposite to the
          Islands.    had the cow skined and some willows sticks collected to make
          canoes of the hides    by 12 OCk. they killed eleven buffaloe most of them in
          fine order.    the bulls are now generally much fatter than the cows and are
          fine beef. I sent out all hands with the horses to assist in buthering and bringing in
          the meat by 3 in the evening we had brought in a large quantity of fine beef and as many
          hides as we wanted for canoes 〈covering〉 shelters and geer. I then set all hands to
          prepare 〈the〉 two canoes 〈in order to pass the river〉    the one we made after
          the mandan fassion with a single skin in the form of a bason
          <ref target="n37071103" n="3"/>and the other we constructed of two skins on a plan of
          our own. we were unable to compleat our canoes this evening.    the wind blew
          very hard.    we continued our operations untill dark and then retired to
          rest. I intend giving my horses a couple of
          <ref target="n37071104" n="4"/>days rest at this place and deposit all my baggage which
          is not necessary to my voyage up

          untill I came up with them, after an early brackfast I proceeded on down a very crooked

          from the S W imediately off Some high mountains Covered with Snow.    the
          violence of this wind retarded our progress very much and the river being emencly
          Crooked we had it imediately in our face nearly every bend.    at 6 P M I

        a musket. Peterson, 84–86.</note>
