               <p>Saturday 19th July 1806.    a clear &amp; pleasant morning.   
          two hunters went on Shore to go across a bend after the buffaloe &amp; we proceeded on
          with the canoes round sd bend.    about 11 A. M. the hunters killed 4 buffaloe
          and a buck deer.    we halted and took the best of the meat or fat and proced.

          most of the men are employed in dressing skins, as we have got all ready for crossing
          the portage as soon as the canoes arrive. The musquitoes were very troublesome to day.
          At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, a sergeant and nine men
          <ref target="n37071929" n="29"/>arrived at our camp, with the canoes and some baggage.
