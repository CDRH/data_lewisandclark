               <p>The Commanding officer feels himself mortifyed and disappointed at the disorderly
          conduct of 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name>, in refusing to mount guard
          when in the due roteen of duty he was regularly warned; nor is he less suprised at the
          want of discretion in those who urged his oposition to the faithfull discharge of his
          duty, particularly 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>, whose sense of propryety he had
          every reason to beleive would have induced him reather to have promoted good order, than
          to have excited disorder and faction among the party, particularly in the absence of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>and himself: The Commanding
          officer is also sorry to find any man, who has been engaged by himself and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>for the expedition on which
          they have entered, so destitute of understanding, as not to be able to draw the
          distinction between being placed under the command of another officer, whose will in
          such case would be their law, and that of obeying the orders of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>and himself communicated to
          them through 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>, who, as one of the party,
          has during their necessary absence been charged with the execution of their orders;
          acting from those orders expressly, and not from his own capriece, and who, is in all
          respects accountable to us for the faithfull observance of the same.</p>
               <p>A moments reflection must convince every man of our party, that were we to neglect
          the more important and necessry arrangements in relation to the voyage we are now
          entering in, for the purpose merely of remaing at camp in order to communicate our
          orders in person to the individuals of the party on mear points of poliece, they would
          have too much reason to complain; nay, even to fear the ultimate success of the
          enterprise in which we are all embarked. The abuse of some of the party with respect to
          the prevelege heretofore granted them of going into the country, is not less
          displeasing; to such as have made hunting or other business a pretext to cover their
          design of visiting a neighbouring whiskey shop, he cannot for the present extend this
          prevelige; and dose therefore most positively direct, that 
          <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Boley, John">Bolye</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Wiser</name>, and 
          <name type="person" key="Robertson, John">Robinson</name>do not recieve permission to
          leave camp under any pretext whatever for 
          <hi rend="italic">ten days,</hi>after this order is read on the parade, unless otherwise
          directed hereafter by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>or himself. The Commanding
          officers highly approve of the conduct of 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>.—</p>
               <p>The Carpenters Blacksmiths, and in short the whole party (except 
          <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floid</name>who has been specially directed to
          perform other duties) are to obey implicitly the orders of 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>, who has recieved our
          instructions on these subjects, and is held accountable to us for their due
          execution.—</p>
