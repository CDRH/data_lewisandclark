As we could not set out we thought it best to send out some hunters and accordingly dispatched <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Sheilds</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> on this side the <name type="place" key="Lewis and Clark (Fort, Netul) River">Netul</name> for that purpose with orders to return in the evening or sooner if they were successfull. The hunters returned late in the evening unsucessfull.    we have not now more than one day's provision on hand.    we directed <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> and the <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Feildses</name> to set out tomorrow morning early, and indevour to provide us some provision on the bay beyond <name type="place" key="Tongue Point (Point William)">point William</name>. we were visited to day by some <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clatsop indians</name> who left us in the evening.    our sick men <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and bratton do not seem to recover; the former was taken with a violent pain in his leg and thye last night. <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> is now so much reduced that I am somewhat uneasy with rispect to his recovery; the pain of which he complains most seems to be seated in the small of his back and remains obstinate. I beleive that it is the rheumatism with which they are both afflicted.—

Friday 21st March 1806.    rained hard all last night, and continues this morning.    a number of natives visited us with Some dryed Small fish to trade which they call in their language oll-can.<ref target="n29032102" n="2"/>    we bought a fiew from them.

                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 21st.</hi>    We had a cloudy wet morning. Two of the hunters<ref target="n29032103" n="3"/> went out this morning; and about 10 o'clock we were visited by some of the <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clat-
sop Indians</name>.

                  <ref target="n29032105" n="5"/> nations, who inhabit the seacoast, all dress in the same manner. The men are wholly naked, except a small robe; the women have only the addition of the short petticoat. Their language also is nearly the same; and they all observe the same ceremony of depositing with the remains of the dead all their property, or placing it at their graves. I believe I saw as many as an hundred canoes at one burying-place of the <name type="native_nation" key="Chinook Indians">Chin-ooks</name>, on the north side of the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, at its entrance into <name type="place" key="Baker (Haley's) Bay">Hailey's Bay</name>: and there are a great many at the burying-place of every village. These Indians on the coast have no horses, and very little property of any kind, except their canoes. The women are much inclined to venery, and like those on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> are sold to prostitution at an easy rate. An old <name type="native_nation" key="Chinook Indians">Chin-ook</name> squaw<ref target="n29032106" n="6"/> frequently visited our quarters, with nine girls which she kept as prostitutes. To the honour of the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>,<ref target="n29032107" n="7"/> who live on the west side of the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>, and extend some distance down the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, we must mention them as an exception; as they do not exhibit those loose feelings of carnal desire, nor appear addicted to the common customs of prostitution: and they are the only nation on the whole route where any thing like chastity is regarded. In the evening our two hunters<ref target="n29032108" n="8"/> returned, but had killed nothing.
