               <p>Set out very early this morning. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>walked on Shore this morning,
          and killed an Antelope, rejoined us at ½ after eight A. M.—    he informed me
          that he had seen many Buffaloe Elk and deer in his absence, and that he had met with a
          great number of old hornets nests
          <ref target="n11041601" n="1"/>in the woody bottoms through which he had passed.—
             the hills of the river still continue extreemly broken for a few miles
          back, when it becomes a fine level country of open fertile lands   
          immediately on the river there are many fine leavel extensive and extreemly fertile high
          plains and meadows. I think the quantity of timbered land on the river is increasing.
             the mineral appearances still continue. I met with several stones today
          that had the appearance of wood first carbonated and then petrefyed by the water of the
          river, which I have discovered has that effect on many vegitable substances when exposed
          to it's influence for a length of time.
          <ref target="n11041602" n="2"/>   I believe it to be the stratas of Coal seen
          in those hills which causes the fire and birnt appearances frequently met with in this
          quarter.    where those birnt appearances are to be seen in the face of the
          river bluffs, the coal is seldom seen, and when you meet with it in the neighbourhood of
          the stratas of birnt earth, the coal appears to be presisely at the same hight, and is
          nearly of the same thickness, togeter with the sand and a sulphurious substance which
          ususually accompanys it.
          <ref target="n11041603" n="3"/>   there was a remarkable large beaver caught
          by one of the party last night.    these anamals are now very abundant. I have
          met with several trees which have been felled by them 20 Inches in diameter.
             bark is their only food; and they appear to prefer that of the Cotton wood
          and willow; as we have never met with any other species of timber on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>which had the appearance of being
          cut by them.—    we passed three small creeks on the Stard. side.
          <ref target="n11041604" n="4"/>   they take their rise in the river hills at
          no great distance.    we saw a great number of geese today, both in the plains
          and on the river—    I have observed but few ducks, those we have met with are
          the Mallard and blue winged Teal.
