               <p>The wind continued to blow tolerably hard this morning but by no means as violently
          as it did yesterday; we determined to set out and accordingly departed a little before
          seven. I walked on shore on the N. side of the river, and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>proceeded with the party.
             the river bottoms through [

          <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Dr Barton</name>
                  </hi>〉] which I passed
          about seven miles were fertil and well covered with Cottonwood some Box alder, ash and
          red Elm.    the under brush, willow, rose bushes Honeysuccle, red willow,
          goosbury, currant and servicebury
          <ref target="n11042001" n="1"/>&amp; in the open grounds along the foot of the river
          hills immence quantities of the hisop.    in the course of my walk I killed
          two deer, wounded an Elk and a deer; saw the remains of some Indian hunting camps, near
          which stood a small scaffold
          <ref target="n11042002" n="2"/>of about 7 feet high on which were deposited two doog
          slays with their harnis. underneath this scaffold a human body was lying, well rolled in
          several dressed buffaloe skins and near it a bag of the same materials containg sundry
          articles belonging to the disceased; consisting of a pare of mockersons, some red and
          blue earth, beaver's nails, instruments for dressing the Buffalo skin, some dryed roots,
          several platts of the sweet grass, and a small quantity of 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>tobacco.—
          <ref target="n11042003" n="3"/>   I presume that the body, as well as the bag
          containing these articles, had formerly been placed on the scaffold as is the custom of
          these people, but had fallen down by accedent.    near the scaffold I saw the
          carcase of a large dog not yet decayed, which I supposed had been killed at the time the
          human body was left on the scaffold; this was no doubt the reward, which the poor doog
          had met with for performing the [
          <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>]—friendly office to his mistres of transporting her corps
          to the place of deposit.    it is customary with the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Assiniboine Indians">Assinniboins</name>, 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetares</name>&amp;c who scaffold
          their dead, to sacrefice the favorite horses and doggs of their disceased relations,
          with a view of their being servicable to them in the land of sperits. I have never heard
          of any instances of human sacrefices on those occasions among them.—</p>
               <p>The wind blew so hard that I concluded it was impossible fror the perogues and canoes
          to proceed and therefore returned and joined them about three in the evening. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>informed me that soon after
          seting out, a part of the bank of the river fell in near one of the canoes and had very
          nearly filled her with water.
          <ref target="n11042004" n="4"/>   that the wind became so hard and the waves
          so high that it was with infinite risk he had been able to get as far as his present
          station.    the white perrogue and several of the canoes had shiped water
          several times but happily our stores were but little injured; those which were wet we
          put out to dry and determined to remain untill the next morning.
          <ref target="n11042005" n="5"/>   we sent out four hunters who soon added 3
          Elk 4 gees and 2 deer to our stock of provisions.
          <ref target="n11042006" n="6"/>   the party caught six beaver today which
          were large and in fine order.    the Buffaloe, Elk and deer are poor at this
          season, and of cours are not very palitable, however our good health and apetites make
          up every necessary deficiency, and we eat very heartily of them.—    encamped
          on Stard side; under a high well timbered bank.</p>

          disagreeable morning; rapid water and a strong wind. Some of the canoes took in a good
          deal of water; and we made but 6 miles, when we were obliged again to lie too, on
          account of the wind, and to dry our loading. While we lay here we killed three elk and
          got a number of Geese eggs out of their nests, which are generally built on trees.</p>
