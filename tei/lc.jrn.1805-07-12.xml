The canoes not having arrived and the wind still high I dispatched <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name> with three men to join <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and assist in completing the canoes retaining only a few who in addition to those in the canoes that I expect every moment, will be sufficient to man the six canoes and take up all the baggage we have here at one load. I feel excessively anxious to be moving on.    the canoes were detained by the wind untill 2 P. M. when they set out and arrived at this place so late that I thought it best to detain them untill morning. <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> came down today for a cople of axes which I sent by him; he returned immediately. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name> and party joined <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> at 10 A. M. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> kept all the men with him busily engaged some in drying meat, others in hunting, and as ma[n]y as could be employed about the canoes. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Segt. Pryor</name> got his sholder dislocated yesterday, it was replaced immediately and is likely to do him but little injury; it is painfull to him today.    the hunters with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name> killed three deer and two otter today.    the otter are now plenty since the water has become sufficiently clear for them to take fish.    the <ref target="n16071201" n="1">blue crested fisher, or as they are sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">Kingfisher,</hi>
                  </ref> is an inhabitant of this part of the country; this bird is very rare on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; I have not seen more than three or four of those birds during my voyage from the entrance of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> to the mouth of <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name> and those few were reather the inhabitants of streams of clerer water which discharged themselves into the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> than of that river, as they were seen about the entrances of such streams. Musquetoes extreemly troublesome to me today nor is a <ref target="n16071202" n="2">large black knat</ref>
less troublesome, which dose not sting, but attacks the eye in swarms and compells us to brush them off or have our eyes filled with them. I made the men dry the ballance of the freshe meet which we had abot the camp amounting to about 200 lbs.—</p>
