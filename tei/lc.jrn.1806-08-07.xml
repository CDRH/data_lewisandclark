               <p>It began to rain about midnight and continued with but little intermission until 10
          A. M. today.    the air was cold and extreemly unpleasant. we set out early
          resolving if possible to reach the 
          <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yelowstone river</name>today which was at the
          distance of 83 ms. from our encampment of the last evening; the currant favoured our
          progress being more rapid than yesterday, the men plyed their oars faithfully and we
          went at a good rate.    at 8 A. M. we passed the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Big Muddy Creek (Martha's River, Yellow River)">Marthy's
          river</name>
                  <ref target="n37080701" n="1"/>which has changed it's entrance since we passed it last
          year, falling in at preasent about a quarter of a mile lower down.    at or
          just below the entrance of this river we meet with the first appearance of Coal birnt
          hills and pumicestone,
          <ref target="n37080702" n="2"/>these appearances seem to be coextensive.   
          here it is also that we find the first Elm
          <ref target="n37080703" n="3"/>and dwarf cedar
          <ref target="n37080704" n="4"/>on the bluffs, the ash
          <ref target="n37080705" n="5"/>first appears in the instance of one solletary tree at
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Deadman (Ash) Rapids">Ash rapid</name>, about the 
          <name type="place" key="Elk Fawn Rapids">Elk rapid</name>
                  <ref target="n37080706" n="6"/>and from thence down we occasionly meet with it
          scattered through the bottoms but it is generally small.    from 
          <name type="place" key="Big Muddy Creek (Martha's River, Yellow River)">Marthy's
          river</name>to 
          <name type="place"
                        key="Milk (Ah-mâh-tâh ru-shush-sher, River Which Scolds at All Others) River">Milk
          river</name>on the N. E. side there is a most beautifull level plain country; the soil
          is much more fertile here than above.
          <ref target="n37080707" n="7"/>   we overtook the 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Feildses</name>at noon.   
          they had killed 2 bear and seen 6 others, we saw and fired on two from our perogue but
          killed neither of them.    these bear resort the river where they lie in wate
          at the crossing places of the game for the Elk and weak cattle; when they procure a
          subject of either they lie by the carcase and keep the wolves off untill they devour it.
             the bear appear to be very abundant on this part of the river.   
          we saw a number of buffaloe Elk &amp;c as we passed but did not detain to kill any of
          them.    we also saw an unnusual flight of white gulls about the size of a
          pigeon with the top of their heads black.
          <ref target="n37080708" n="8"/>at 4 P. M. we arrived at the entrance of the 
          <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone river</name>.
          <ref target="n37080709" n="9"/>I landed at the point and found that 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>had been encamped at this
          place and 〈was gone〉 from appearances had left it about 7 or 8 days. I found a paper on
          a pole at the point which mearly contained my name in the hand wrighting of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>   we also found the
          remnant of a note which had been attatched to a peace of Elk's horns in the camp; from
          this fragment I learned that game was scarce at the point and musquetoes troublesome
          which were the reasons given for his going on; I also learnt that he intended halting a
          few miles below where he intended waiting my arrival. I now wrote a note directed to 
          <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>provided they were behind,
          ordering them to come on without loss of time; this note I wraped in leather and
          attatced onto the same pole which 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>had planted at the point; this
          being done I instantly reimbarked and decended the river in the hope of reaching 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C's</name>camp before night.   
          about 7 miles below the point on the S. W. shore I saw some meat that had been lately
          fleased and hung on a pole; I directed 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>to go on shore examine the
          place; on his return he reported that he saw the tracks of two men which appeared so
          resent that he beleived they had been there today, the fire he found at the plce was
          blaizing and appeared to have been mended up afresh or within the course of an hour
          past.    he found at this place a part of a Chinnook hat which my men
          recognized as the hat of 
          <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>;
          <ref target="n37080710" n="10"/>from these circumstances we included that 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C's</name>camp could not be distant and
          pursued our rout untill dark with the hope of reaching his camp in this however we were
          disappointed and night coming on compelled us to encamp on the N. E. shore in the next
          bottom above our encampment of the 23rd and 24th of April 1805.
          <ref target="n37080711" n="11"/>   as we came too a herd of buffaloe
          assembled on the shore of which we killed a fat cow.—</p>

          <ref target="n37080712" n="12"/>Soon after we landed the wind blew very hard for about
          2 hours, when it lulled a little.    the air was exceedingly Clear and Cold
          and not a misquetor to be Seen, which is a joyfull circumstance to the Party.</p>
