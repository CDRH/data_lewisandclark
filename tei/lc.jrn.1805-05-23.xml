               <p>Set out early this morning, the frost was severe last night, the ice appeared along
          the edge of the water, water also freized on the oars.    at the distance of
          one mile passed the entrance of a creek 15 yds. wide on Stard. side, this we call 
          <name type="place" key="CK (Teapot) Creek">Teapot Creek</name>,
          <ref target="n14052302" n="2"/>it affords no water at it's mouth but has runing water
          at some small distance above, this I beleive to be the case with many of those creekes
          which we have passed since we entered this hilley country, the water is absorbed by the
          earth near the river and of course appear dry; they afford but little water at any rate,
          and that is so strongly impregnated with these salts that it is unfit for uce; all the
          wild anamals appear fond of this water; I have tryed it by way of experiment &amp; find
          it moderately pergative, but painfull to the intestens in it's opperation.   
          this creek runs directly towards some low mountains which lye N. W. of it and appear to
          be about 30 mes. distant, perhaps it heads in them. This range of mountains appear to be
          about 70 miles long runing from E to W. having their Eastern extremity about 30 mes.:
          distant in a northwardly direction from

          <hi rend="italic">NB: Tea</hi>] pot Island</name>.—
          <ref target="n14052303" n="3"/>   also passed two small creeks on Lard. and
          two others on Stard. all inconsiderable and dry at their entrances.    just
          above the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="CK (Teapot) Creek">Teapot Creek</name>on the stard. there is a
          large assemblage of the burrows of the Burrowing Squirrel
          <ref target="n14052304" n="4"/>   they generally seelect a south or a south
          Easterly exposure for their residence, and never visit the brooks or river for water; I
          am astonished how this anamal exists as it dose without water,
          <ref target="n14052305" n="5"/>particularly in a country like this where there is
          scarcely any rain during ¾ of the year and more rarely any due [dew]; yet we have
          sometimes found their villages at the distance of five or six miles from any water, and
          they are never found out of the limits of the ground which their burrows occupy; in the
          Autumn when the hard frosts commence they close their burrows and do not venture out
          again untill spring, indeed some of them appear to be yet in winter quarters.
             passed 3 Islands the two first covered with tall cottonwood timber and the
          last with willows only.    river more rappid, &amp; the country much the same
          as yesterday.    some spruce pine
          <ref target="n14052306" n="6"/>of small size appears among the pitch pine, and reather
          more rock than usual on the face of the hills. The musquetoes troublesome this evening,
          a circumstance I did not expect from the temperature of the morning. The Gees begin to
          lose the feathers of their wings and are unable to fly. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>walked on shore and killed 4
          deer and an Elk. We killed a large fat brown bear which took the water after being
          wounded and was carried under some driftwood where he sunk and we were unable to get
          him. Saw but few buffaloe today, but a great number of Elk, deer, some antelopes and 5
          bear. The wild rose [

          blume are very abundant, they appear to differ but little from those common to the
          Atlantic States, the leaves of the bushes and the bush itself appear to be of somewhat
          smaller size.
