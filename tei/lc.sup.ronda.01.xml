            <head rend="center">Introduction to the Bicentennial Edition</head>
            <p> Henry David Thoreau once asked, "how many a man has dated a new era in his life from
               the reading of a book?" Thoreau's question was his way of acknowleding the power of
               print to transform and redirect lives. Thomas Jefferson would have agreed. The idea
               for the Lewis and Clark expedition was born in the summer of 1802 when he read
               Alexander Mackenzie's <hi rend="italic">Voyages from Montreal</hi> and realized that
               John Bull might claim the West before Uncle Sam made it over the mountains. For me
               the book that changed everything was John L. Allen's <hi rend="italic">Passage
                  through the Garden: Lewis and Clark and the Image of the American Northwest,</hi>
               first published by the University of Illinois Press in 1975. Reading it set me to
               studying western exploration in general and the Lewis and Clark expedition in
               particular. It was <hi rend="italic">Passage through the Garden</hi> that prompted me
               to ask if anyone had written about Lewis and Clark and native people. The topic
               seemed an obvious one to me, and I was sure that many books must explore so rich and
               compelling a subject. When I learned there were none, I impetuously decided to try my
               hand at the topic. <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> would not
               have come into existence without <hi rend="italic">Passage through the Garden.</hi>
               Books make a difference; reading changes lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> was sparked by reading what
               John Allen wrote about geographic exploration, but the book also developed at a
               unique time in the writing of American history. Beginning in the 1960s many
               historians and other scholars were deeply involved in a comprehensive reevaluation of
               race in the American experience. While some scholars centered their attention on
               African Americans and Asian Americans, others probed the complexities of Native
               American cultures and communities. Until that time much Native American history
               centered on federal Indian policy and formal tribal histories. The story was most
               often told from Washington, D.C., and the principal actors were bureaucrats,
               soldiers, missionaries, and white settlers. But a different approach—something
               called ethnohistory—offered a new way to tell old stories. Inspired by the
               shared perspectives of history and anthropology, ethnohistorians expanded the field
               of inquiry, asked fresh questions, paid attention to often-neglected native sources,
               and listened carefully to Indian voices. Throughout the 1970s the ethnohistory I
               wrote described native people, Christian missionaries, and the changes sweeping
               throughout the colonial Northeast. In retrospect that work—so far from the
               Native American West of Lewis and Clark—prepared me to ask new questions about
               the larger western exploration story. As I wrote in the preface to this book, what
               captured my imagination was the possibility of writing "exploration
               ethnohistory."</p>
            <p> At the very time Native American history experienced both transformation and
               renewal, the field of western American history underwent profound changes. While <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> was never identified with
               what became known as the "New Western History," the book was undoubtedly influenced
               by reading and listening to Patricia Nelson Limerick, Bill Cronon, Richard White, and
               Donald Worster. Their struggles to redefine western history and escape the
               intellectual straitjacket of the Turner Thesis impressed me and encouraged me. At the
               same time I did not want to abandon the narrative power and broad appeal I admired in
               the writing of Francis Parkman and Bernard DeVoto. Like them, I also wanted to engage
               a wider audience that included readers beyond the academic ranks. Quite simply, I
               hoped to write narrative history informed by a reinvigorated Indian history and a
               renewed western history. Exploration history—with its journey structure and
               memorable cast of characters—seemed to offer that possibility.</p>
            <p> Because I was not trained as a western historian, I knew I needed a mentor, someone
               to guide me up the trails and over the mountains. In January 1980 I wrote to Donald
               Jackson—the dean of Lewis and Clark scholars—asking his help with my
               project. Don's answer was quick and gracious. As the senior editor at the University
               of Illinois Press and later as founding editor of the George Washington Papers at the
               University of Virginia, he never had students. Now Don became a professor. I was his
               sole student and our often-weekly letters were a seminar in the writing of western
               exploration history. Those letters continued until his death in December 1987.
               Rereading them now I can see Don cajoling and correcting me, keeping me on the trail,
               and reminding me not to lose track of the narrative line. If the dedication page had
               not been promised to someone else, it surely would have gone to Don.</p>
            <p> When Thomas Jefferson prepared exploration instructions for Meriwether Lewis in June
               1803 he repeated one phrase—"the object of your journey"—again and again.
               The president used the word "object" to mean "objective." <hi rend="italic">Lewis and
                  Clark among the Indians</hi> also has its objects. Perhaps the most important of
               those objects is to tell a familiar western journey story in a new way. I wanted to
               give readers a different angle of vision, another way to appreciate a story that had
               grown too familiar and perhaps a bit stale. Simply put, <hi rend="italic">Lewis and
                  Clark among the Indians</hi> asks readers to get off the expedition's boats and
               get on the bank. What had always been seen through the eyes of Lewis and Clark needed
               to be experienced through the eyes of native people. By shifting points of view and
               introducing new speakers I hoped to tell a richer and more compelling story, one that
               would reflect the diversity of the West itself.</p>
            <p> That was my intention. I soon found that the telling involved a research task of
               considerable size and complexity. The task was more than thinking out a new research
               design. It involved enlarging the Lewis and Clark story in particular and the western
               exploration story in general. Writing history is always an act of the imagination.
               What I needed to do was reimagine the expedition and the western worlds through which
               it moved. In the popular mind Jefferson's Corps of Discovery had only three
               members—Lewis, Clark, and Sacagawea. Donald Jackson's magisterial <hi rend="italic">Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition</hi> changed all that for
               those who were paying attention. Jackson put it with characteristic bluntness: "It is
               no longer useful to think of the Lewis and Clark Expedition as the personal story of
               two men. Their journey . . . was an enterprise of many aims and a product of many
               minds." Jackson's cast of characters ranged from the attorney general of the United
               States to obscure craftspeople in Philadelphia and St. Louis. Challenged by Jackson's
               words and our correspondence, I went in search of an even larger cast, one that acted
               on a stage that stretched up the Missouri, across the mountains, down the Columbia,
               and on to the shores of the Pacific. If this journey story was to have any cultural
               meanings within the larger American experience, it needed a telling that paid
               attention to native aims and minds.</p>
            <p> Enlarging the expedition story called for more actors on a wider stage; it also
               meant broadening the range of sources and methodologies from those typically used in
               writing history. <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> drew
               heavily on the available anthropological and archaeological literature, especially
               the site reports from digs along the Missouri and Columbia Rivers. Here I had the
               good fortune to meet W. Raymond Wood, one of the foremost northern Great Plains
               archaeologists. He introduced me to unpublished materials, including specialized
               studies done for the National Park Service. From there the research spread out to
               formal, academic tribal histories and the invaluable oral traditions preserved in
               many different ways. But in all of this I repeatedly came back to the expedition's
               journals. Don Jackson once called the expedition's journal keepers "the writingest
               explorers" in American history. What I found in a close and critical reading of
               Lewis, Clark, John Ordway, Patrick Gass, Joseph Whitehouse, and Charles Floyd was a
               wealth of material about expedition-Indian relations. The biases and prejudices are
               surely there; but so are the native voices. The journals name the names and mark out
               the places. And it is more than simply names and places. At a certain level writing
               history is an act of rescue. Historians rescue and restore lost voices. The Lewis and
               Clark journals make that kind of rescue and restoration possible. Again and again
               Corps of Discovery journal keepers recorded what native people told them about
               everything from plants and animals to geography and relations with tribal neighbors.
               Despite what were surely inadequate translations we can still hear the voices of
               Mandan chief Black Cat, Clatsop headman Coboway, and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                    rend="box">Nez
                  Perce</ref> chief Twisted Hair. It is those voices that give depth and richness
               to the Lewis and Clark story.</p>
            <p> In the nearly twenty years since the publication of <hi rend="italic">Lewis and
                  Clark among the Indians</hi> interest has only grown in the expedition and its
               place in the history of the American West. That fascination has been fueled by a
               tidal wave of books, television documentaries, guided tours, and museum exhibitions.
               The shared bicentennials of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the Louisiana Purchase
               add that much more to a widespread enthusiasm for the Corps of Discovery and its
               journey. While many in the general public still cling to the notion of Jefferson's
               explorers as "captains courageous," historians have come to appreciate the expedition
               story as an emblematic moment in the larger history of the continent. The central
               argument in <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> has gained
               considerable acceptance. Most who write about the expedition now acknowledge that
               native people were at the heart of the enterprise. Without those Indian voices and
               views the story is at best only half told.</p>
            <p> Some two decades later I would have said some things more forcefully. One of those
               would be the importance of Indians as explorers. Just as Lewis and Clark explored the
               lives and cultures of native people, so too did Indians explore Jefferson's travelers
               and the things they carried with them. What happened from the Missouri to the
               Columbia was mutual discovery, shared moments of exploration encounter. Much of that
               discovery was done through the fog of confusion, misunderstanding, and ambiguity. But
               when Black Cat went to Fort Mandan inquiring about the expedition's "fashions," he
               was part of a Corps of Discovery far larger than Thomas Jefferson ever imagined.</p>
            <p> Perhaps nothing has contributed more to Lewis and Clark scholarship over the past
               twenty years than the appearance of Gary E. Moulton's magnificent <hi rend="italic">Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,</hi> published by the University of
               Nebraska Press. When I wrote <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi>
               in the early 1980s, only the atlas volume of the Moulton edition was available. My
               research was in the Reuben Gold Thwaites edition, with its reasonably reliable text
               but woefully inadequate annotations. Had I started a bit later, my book would have
               benefited substantially from the comprehensive ethnographic and linguistic
               scholarship that informs the entire Moulton edition. Examples abound. I would have
               spelled and translated names like Untongarabar (Black Buffalo Bull) or War-cha-pa
               (The Stabber) differently. I would have more precisely located important <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                    rend="box">Nez
                  Perce</ref> and Columbia River villages and fishing camps. I would have had much
               more to say about the native use of medicinal plants and medical practices. Perhaps
               most important, I could have made use of the superb linguistic scholarship present in
               every Moulton volume.</p>
            <p> On May 13, 1804—the day the Corps of Discovery left its camp at Wood
               River—William Clark wrote that the expedition's "road across the continent"
               would take it through a "multitude of Indians." Almost a year later, as the company
               prepared to head out from Fort Mandan on its way to the Pacific, Meriwether Lewis
               declared that he and his fellow travelers were "about to penetrate a country . . . on
               which the foot of civillized man had never trodden." In that contest of
               images—a West filled with native people and an empty, savage land—Clark
               had it right. He recognized something fundamental about his own journey and the
               larger American journey. The expedition was a diverse human community moving through
               the lands and lives of other communities. This was no "tour of discovery" through an
               empty West. <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> is an attempt to
               tell that story. What has so often been recounted in terms of high adventure,
               national triumph, and male courage needs to be told again as a complex human story.
                  <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> aims at overturning the
               old narrative and replacing it with one more subtle, more nuanced, and, I hope, more
               compelling. I remain persuaded that this story and its many voices has much to offer
               as we struggle to understand our troubled past and often-uncertain present. This
               larger Corps of Discovery is a reminder that we are all pilgrims on the way, making
               our way by the kindness of strangers. </p>

            <p> The Lewis and Clark expedition has long symbolized the westering impulse in American
               life. No other exploring party has so fully captured the imagination of ordinary
               citizens or the attention of scholars. In ways that defy rational explanation, the
               picture of Lewis and Clark struggling up the Missouri and across the mountains to the
               great western sea continues to stir our national consciousness. Books, highway
               markers, museum displays, and a foundation dedicated to preserving the Lewis and
               Clark trail all bear witness to a fascination that time has only deepened.</p>
            <p> Over the generations since the expedition returned from the Pacific, its achievement
               and significance for America heading west have undergone constant reappraisal. From
               an early emphasis on the journey as an epic of physical endurance and courage, Lewis
               and Clark have emerged in this century as pioneer western naturalists, cartographers,
               and diplomats. Thomas Jefferson, the man William Clark once called "that great
               Chaructor the Main Spring" of the expedition, would have heartily endorsed an
               evaluation of the Corps of Discovery that included sharp minds as well as strong
               bodies. And Jefferson would have reminded us that his explorers were part of that
               long encounter between Euro-Americans and native Americans. In its daily affairs and
               official actions, the expedition passed through, changed, and was in turn changed by
               countless native lives.</p>
            <p> In the simplest terms, this book is about what happens when people from different
               cultural persuasions meet and deal with each other. The Lewis and Clark expedition
               was an integral and symbolic part of what James Axtell has aptly called "the American
               encounter." Nearly two and a half years of almost constant contact between explorers
               and Indians illuminate the larger and longer series of cultural relationships that
               began centuries before on the margins of the continent. This book is not a retelling
               of the familiar Lewis and Clark adventure. That story has been told with grace and
               skill by Bernard DeVoto and in the magnificent photographs of Ingvard Eide and David
               Muench. But readers will find moments of high drama not previously well known or
               clearly understood. This book is not an attempt to dress up exploration history with
               feathers and paint to satisfy current political needs. Nor is it a stitching together
               of capsule tribal histories and ethnographies. Finally, readers need not expect a
               catalog of every ethnographic observation recorded in the journals of the
               expedition.</p>
            <p>What this book does offer is something new for the history of exploration in general
               and Lewis and Clark literature in particular—a full-scale contact study of the
               official and personal relations between the explorers and the Indians. In 1952,
               Bernard De Voto wrote that "a dismaying amount of our history has been written
               without regard to the Indians." While much has changed since then, the history of
               exploration remains largely the story of the explorers themselves. <hi rend="italic">Lewis and Clark among the Indians</hi> is an effort to meet DeVoto's challenge by
               looking at the very explorers he wrote about with such passion and perception. Lewis
               and Clark were indeed what William Goetzmann has labeled them, "diplomats in
               buckskin," but they and their party amounted to something more as well. The Corps of
               Discovery was a human community living in the midst of other human communities. The
               word <hi rend="italic">among</hi> in the title was chosen to suggest that sense of
               living together. The daily dealings of Indians and explorers touched the full range
               of action and emotion. What is treated in these pages runs the gamut from high policy
               to personal liaisons, from the careful collection of ethnographic data to the sharing
               of food and songs around a blazing fire.</p>
            <p> Every historian must first come to terms with his sources. Because the thoughts and
               actions of men like Weuche, Yelleppit, and Coboway are as central to the story of the
               expedition as the plans and designs of the explorers themselves, it is important to
               note the evidence and method used in this study. Donald Jackson once described Lewis
               and Clark as "the writingest explorers of their time." Lewis, Clark, Sergeants John
               Ordway, Charles Floyd, and Patrick Gass, and Private Joseph Whitehouse all wrote
               long, often perceptive passages in their diaries about native people. Despite the
               kinds of obvious cultural biases that scholars have long since learned to deal with
               in documentary analysis, the Lewis and Clark records provide a store of information
               about Indians unequaled in the literature of exploration. When joined to other
               contemporary evidence produced by the likes of David Thompson, Alexander Henry the
               Younger, Pierre-Antoine Tabeau, and Prince Maxmilian of Wied, the historical record
               is rich indeed. But by itself that written documentary record cannot fully explain
               the intricate patterns of encounter that bound Indians and explorers together. To
               that evidence this study brings the findings of anthropology and archaeology. Site
               reports and culture element distributions are used here not as fashionable window
               dressing but as a vital means to give depth and meaning to the behavior of native
               people. Tribal history is here meant to suggest context in human action. Ethnohistory
               has been usefully defined by Mildred Wedel and Raymond DeMallie as the critical
               examination of written evidence in the light of anthropological perspectives. This
               book is exploration ethnohistory, a deliberate effort to probe the complexity of
               Indian-white encounters in North America by examining a memorable venture that has
               come to represent the westward movement.</p>
            <p> The Lewis and Clark drama had actors drawn from both sides of the cultural divide.
               As Lewis and Clark were important players with powerful lines, so too were Black
               Buffalo, Cameahwait, and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"

               Ingvard Eide called it, "the American odyssey," then all the argonauts—those
               who ventured to the sea and those who watched in wonder—must have their voices
               heard. The Lewis and Clark expedition has come to mean something special if
               indefinable in our national history. All the participants in that odyssey require
               their measure so that the story of the expedition and the nation not be half-told.
               This book is about that measure and those voices. </p>

            <p> Meriwether Lewis once called the expedition "a darling project of mine." This book
               has been that for me during the past four years. Thanking friends, colleagues, and
               companions for support, encouragement, and criticism is the most pleasant task any
               writer can undertake. This book began when I read John Allen's brilliant <hi rend="italic">Passage through the Garden</hi> and wondered if anyone had made a
               study of the Corps of Discovery and native peoples. My earliest research on explorers
               and Indians was aided and abetted by two institutions—the Youngstown State
               University Research Council and Mike Faklis, gifted bookman and supplier of endlessly
               delightful volumes. As that research progressed I steadily incurred debts that demand
               at least interest paid here. I am especially grateful to the staff at the Missouri
               Historical Society, William Lang at the Montana Historical Society, Joseph Porter at
               the Joslyn Art Museum, and Stephen Catlett at the American Philosophical Society.
               John Allen, William Goetzmann, and Alvin Josephy, Jr., provided comments and
               inspiration in greater measure than hoped for. Five minutes with John Ewers cleared
               up a whole knot of Blackfeet questions. I owe a special debt to Ray Wood for
               anthropological services rendered. Gary Moulton, editor of the new Lewis and Clark
               Journals project, has been both friend and long-distance colleague.</p>
            <p> Anyone pursuing Lewis and Clark must eventually encounter the wonderful people who
               make up the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation. Among those in the foundation
               who gave me support and encouragement were Irving Anderson, E. G. "Frenchy" Chuinard,
               Robert Lange, and the best guide any greenhorn could want, Wilbur Werner of Cut Bank,
               Montana. Closer to home, research was made easier by the services of Hildegard
               Schnuttgen, who heads the Interlibrary Loan Department at Maag Library, Youngstown
               State University. Mrs. Margaret Carl took drafts filled with strange names and
               distant places and made sense of them all. Colleagues in the Department of
               History—especially Fred Blue, Lowell Satre, Agnes Smith, and Martin
               Berger—have heard more about Lewis and Clark than they ever wanted to know.</p>
            <p> If this book did not already have a dedication promised long ago, it would be sent
               with affection and thanks to three extraordinary people. From the beginning of this
               venture, Donald Jackson has read each chapter with the kind of critical eye for both
               style and substance that only he has. Don's enthusiasm prodded me on when several
               chapters got stalled on the wrong side of the Great Divide. Jim Axtell was part of my
               life long before it was invaded by Lewis and Clark. His patient, perceptive reading
               of the chapters has meant more than I can tell. That both of us appear in each
               other's acknowledgments, books, and articles only hints at what more than ten years
               of conversations and letters have yielded. But no one has lived more with this
               enterprise than my wife, Jeanne. She braved five weeks of demanding dirt camping in
               the summer of 1980 as we retraced the Lewis and Clark route. Her faith never wavered;
               my gratitude is equally unwavering. All of these friends share in what is good
               between these covers, but not in the shortcomings, which are mine.</p>

               <p> The Indian relations of the Lewis and Clark expedition began long before the
                  explorers nosed their boats into the Missouri current and headed upriver. Thomas
                  Jefferson knew that as his explorers moved over the visible world of rivers,
                  mountains, and plains, they would also pass through a more important world—a
                  sometimes invisible universe of Indian politics and European rivalries. He grasped
                  what so often escaped others, that the American West was a crowded wilderness.
                  Although nudged by reading Alexander Mackenzie, Jefferson did not need the dour
                  Scot to tell him that lands from St. Louis to the great western sea were neither
                  empty nor unclaimed. The political and economic face of the land had already been
                  transformed by a generation of intense competition between tribal peoples and
                  agents of Spain, France, and Great Britain. The president understood at least the
                  outlines and implications of that struggle and the place of a latecoming American
                  republic in it. If the Lewis and Clark expedition was to be successful, whether
                  for science, commerce, or statecraft, it would need to navigate through troubled
                  Indian waters.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> From the beginning, Jefferson sought to fashion an expedition capable of
                  gathering valuable information about western Indians while living at peace with
                  them. That search became plain as he drafted instructions for his young secretary,
                  Meriwether Lewis. The president loved questionnaires. He used them to explore new
                  areas of knowledge and then to organize what he had learned. Jefferson's only
                  published book, <hi rend="italic">Notes on Virginia,</hi> was written in response
                  to a questionnaire from the French diplomat and scientist François
                  Barbé-Marbois and retained the question-and-answer form in its chapters.<ref target="n0101" n="1"/> Jefferson's instructions to Lewis were a series of
                  interlocking questions ranging from mineralogy to medicine. The ethnographic
                  queries covered nearly every aspect of Indian life, including languages, customs,
                  occupations, diseases, and morals.</p>
               <p> Where did those very precise questions come from? The traditional answer has been
                  that the Indian objectives pursued by Lewis and Clark reflected Jefferson's
                  lifelong fascination with native American cultures. But there was more than one
                  mind and one set of motives behind the expedition's Indian questions and its
                  general policy toward native people. Early in 1803 Jefferson began to write
                  friends both in and out of government asking their aid and advice for his western
                  enterprise. In February he wrote three prominent Philadelphia scientists, Caspar
                  Wistar, Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton, and Dr. Benjamin Rush, asking each to prepare
                  some thoughts "in the lines of botany, zoology, or of Indian history which you
                  think most worthy of inquiry and observation."<ref target="n0102" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p> Even before his consultants submitted their questions, Jefferson began to prepare
                  a preliminary draft of the instructions. By mid-April 1803 he was ready to
                  circulate it among certain cabinet members for their responses. The remarks of
                  Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin focused on western geography and the
                  future expansion of the United States. Later in his career Gallatin made a major
                  contribution in collecting and systematizing Indian material in his "Synopsis of
                  the Indian Tribes." But just how much he had to do with framing the expedition's
                  Indian questions remains unclear.<ref target="n0103" n="3"/> On the other hand,
                  the reply from Attorney General Levi Lincoln clearly influenced Jefferson's
                  thinking. This important member of Jefferson's official family has not received
                  much attention from students of western exploration. Lincoln, an able New England
                  lawyer and a skillful Republican politician, understood that the expedition served
                  many purposes. Lincoln's April 17 letter to Jefferson suggests that the early
                  draft of instructions he saw contained very little about Indians. To remedy this
                  deficiency, Lincoln urged Jefferson to include questions about tribal religions,
                  native legal practice, concepts of property ownership, and Indian medical
                  procedures. Although Jefferson was acquainted with smallpox inoculation, it
                  appears that Lincoln was the first to suggest that Lewis take some cowpox matter
                  along to administer to the Indians. If they were to have extensive contact with
                  whites, they needed to be protected against smallpox. Dead Indians could not
                  participate in an American trade network and dying natives could only blame the
                  explorers for spreading disease. The attorney general's suggestions were of major
                  importance, although he made them more out of political expediency than scientific
                  curiosity. Lincoln was very sensitive to Federalist opposition to the journey, and
                  indeed to any American westward expansion. He realized that the administration
                  would need to justify the expedition on the high ground of science if it
                     failed.<ref target="n0104" n="4"/>
               </p>
               <p> Levi Lincoln's helpful comments sharpened Jefferson's focus on Indians. That
                  focus was further enlarged and refined in May 1803 when Benjamin Rush gave Lewis a
                  detailed list of ethnographic queries. In 1774 Rush had presented a long paper
                  before the American Philosophical Society titled "Natural History of Medicine
                  among the Indians of North America." That discourse presented his thoughts on all
                  physical aspects of Indian life from diet and hygiene to sexual performance and
                     pregnancy.<ref target="n0105" n="5"/> The same wide range of interests was
                  evident in a list Rush prepared for the expedition. That document was divided into
                  three sections, with medical concerns predictably taking first place. Under the
                  heading "Physical history &amp; medicine," Rush proposed twenty separate
                  questions. He asked the explorers to record Indian eating, sleeping, and bathing
                  habits as well as native diseases and remedies. The Philadelphia savant wanted to
                  know when Indians married, how long children were breast fed, and how long they
                  lived. Rush even urged Lewis to find time to check Indian pulse rates morning,
                  noon, and night both before and after they ate.</p>
               <p> Rush's interests went well beyond medicine, encompassing Indian customs and
                  values as well. The second part of Rush's list included four questions touching on
                  crime, suicide, and intoxication. His third section probed native American worship
                  practices, sacred objects, and burial rituals. Like so many other European and
                  American scientists, Rush was fascinated by Indian religions. Moreover, he
                  believed, as did many of his contemporaries, that studies of Indian languages and
                  religious ceremonies might prove or disprove a very old and persistent notion
                  about the origin of native people. A widespread academic theory held that Indians
                  might constitute one of the lost tribes of the children of Israel. If the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> were misplaced Welshmen, as so many thought, why not see if
                  there were any Jewish Indians in the West?<ref target="n0106" n="6"/>
               </p>
               <p> By June 1803 Jefferson had before him all the suggestions from fellow scientists
                  and government officials. He also had delivered in January the confidential
                  message to Congress that justified the expedition on grounds of extending the
                  Indian trade. He could draw on instructions written for the abortive Michaux
                  expedition a decade before.<ref target="n0107" n="7"/> Sometime during June,
                  Jefferson synthesized these documents into a final draft of instructions for the
                  expedition—instructions that now contained detailed questions in seventeen
                  areas of Indian life and culture. Those questions covered everything from language
                  and law to trade and technology. The explorers were to record what Indians wore,
                  what they ate, how they made a living, and what they believed in. In short,
                  Jefferson told Lewis: "You will therefore endeavor to make yourself acquainted as
                  far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit, with the names of the
                  nations &amp; their numbers."<ref target="n0108" n="8"/>
               </p>
               <p> Jefferson's reasons for converting two army officers and at least some of their
                  companions into ethnographers were central to the many purposes of the journey.
                  One of those aims linked exploration and business enterprise to national
                  expansion. Finding the passage to the Pacific was supposed to yield financial
                  rewards. "The commerce," wrote Jefferson, "which may be carried on with the people
                  inhabiting the line you will pursue, renders a knolege of those people
                     important."<ref target="n0109" n="9"/> The president did not fully understand
                  the complex character of trade systems already functioning on the northern plains
                  and in the Pacific Northwest. But he was intent on expanding American commercial
                  influence. Jefferson knew that fur traders and other eager entrepreneurs needed to
                  know about future markets and sources of supply. He envisioned western America as
                  a vast trade empire to rival a similar system already being forged by agents of
                  the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. If the United States was to
                  compete in the great western space race, Indians needed to be wooed away from John
                  Bull's Canadian traders and written into the ledger books of Uncle Sam's St. Louis
                  merchants.</p>
               <p> But there was something else behind Jefferson's requirement that the Lewis and
                  Clark expedition be an ethnographic enterprise—something beyond sea otters
                  and beaver pelts. Lewis and Clark were to gather material for another
                  empire—the empire of the mind, the kingdom of knowledge. Like his friends at
                  the American Philosophical Society, Jefferson wanted the expedition to make a
                  lasting contribution toward the scientific understanding of North America. That
                  was what he meant when he described the venture as a "literary expedition." The
                  knowledge was not to be gathered by the explorers for its own sake, however, but
                  in the service of government and commerce.</p>
               <p> Finally, and not to be overlooked, there was Jefferson's vision of the future of
                  the American republic. He believed that accurate information about Indians was
                  essential in order to shape a peaceful environment for both peoples. The desire
                  for fact to replace speculation about native Americans was nothing new in
                  Jefferson's mind. From boyhood he had had a passionate interest in things Indian.
                  "In the early part of my life," he wrote, "I was very familiar with the Indians,
                  and acquired impressions of attachment and commiseration for them which have never
                  been obliterated."<ref target="n0110" n="10"/> Jefferson's fascination with Indian
                  life and lore was part boyish curiosity and part scientific enquiry, all bound up
                  in the optimistic notion that if native Americans surrendered their traditional
                  "savage" ways and adopted a white "civilized" life, both peoples could enjoy the
                  continent in peace. "Acuiqre what knolege you can of [their] state of morality,
                  religion &amp; information" was the way Jefferson put it to Lewis.<ref target="n0111" n="11"/> It was a Jeffersonian fundamental that if the two
                  peoples knew each other more fully, each would treat the other with respect and
                  consideration. Ethnography could make federal policy better informed and hence
                  more humane. With an optimism based more on Enlightenment faith than American
                  reality, Jefferson assumed that a benevolent government would use such information
                  to civilize and Christianize Indians. Whether or not native people would welcome
                  the spiritual and cultural blessings of European civilization was, of course, the
                  unasked question.</p>
               <p> Ethnographical research was neither the prime nor the sole duty of the
                  expedition. Jefferson wanted his explorers to take their scientific tasks
                  seriously as they collected information and artifacts, but he had much more in
                  mind. As representatives of the United States, Lewis and Clark were expected to
                  pursue the Indian policy goals of the republic. By 1803 those goals for the tribes
                  east of the Mississippi were quite clear. Reflecting long colonial experience,
                  federal Indian policy sought to acquire native lands at low cost while urging
                  tribal people to shuck off hunting and breechcloths for plows and trousers.
                  Couched in the language of Christian philanthropy, Jeffersonian Indian policy
                  pursued national expansion with single-minded zeal. But in the West of the
                  Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson was less certain of both policy and strategy. Those
                  new lands were for traders, not white settlers. They might even provide refuge for
                  native people dispossessed by the farming frontier.</p>
               <p> Jefferson's different approaches to tribes east and west of the Mississippi are
                  plain in the language he used in addressing delegations from the various regions.
                  In speaking to eastern delegations the president always coupled his program for
                  civilization with land acquisition. To western delegations, including those
                  organized by Lewis and Clar, trade was the prime focus. When Jefferson drafted
                  instructions for Lewis in 1803, negotiations with France were underway but the
                  outcome was yet unclear. For that reason the diplomatic objectives enumerated in
                  the directions for Lewis focused on trade while tactfully ignoring questions of
                  power and sovereignty. The expedition was ordered to acquaint Indians with "the
                  position, extent, character, peaceable and commercial disposition of the United
                  States, and of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them." The
                  factory system, a chain of government trading posts, had been an integral part of
                  American policy since the mid-1780s. Jefferson knew that attractive goods and
                  suitable post locations were essential in the face of powerful British
                  competition. For that reason Lewis was told to confer with Indians on "the points
                  most convenient as mutual emporiums" as well as "the articles of most desirable
                  interchange for them and us."<ref target="n0112" n="12"/>
               </p>
               <p> Jefferson expected that Lewis and Clark would hold frequent conferences with
                  Indians. But he also knew that the rigorous demands of travel made extensive talks
                  impossible. Therefore Lewis was instructed to organize delegations of chiefs and
                  elders to be sent to Washington. Just as colonial Indian agents once sent Mohawks
                  and Cherokees to London, Jefferson assumed that Omahas and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> in the Federal City would be properly impressed with the wealth
                  and power of the new nation. And in an afterthought whose origins looked back to
                  the earliest days of Indian-European encounter, the president hoped the expedition
                  might find some young Indians willing to be "brought up with us, and taught such
                  arts as may be useful to them." It was a dream that had haunted missionary and
                  bureaucrat alike—native children gladly leaving their parents to embrace new
                  fathers.</p>
               <p> The creation of Indian delegations and a search for good trade sites were as
                  close as Jefferson got in June 1803 to giving his explorers explicitly imperial
                  and political directives. Although his commitment to an expanding nation was
                  already plain, Jefferson was not about to give Lewis and Clark instructions that
                  violated territorial bounds as they existed before the Louisiana Purchase. The
                  spread of American commercial influence would be quite sufficient. But once the
                  purchase was diplomatic reality, announcing American sovereignty to native people
                  became a vital part of the expedition's Indian policy. Parts of Jefferson's
                  January 22, 1804, letter to Lewis can be seen as an appendix to the original
                  instructions. Lewis and Clark were now formally to extend American power up the
                  Missouri and toward the mountains. Jefferson's own words indicate how much the
                  diplomatic role of the expedition had expanded since the summer of 1803: <quote>
                     Being now become sovereigns of the country, without however any diminution of
                     the Indian rights of occupancy we are authorized to propose to them in direct
                     terms the institution of commerce with them. It will now be proper you should
                     inform those through whose country you will pass, or whom you may meet, that
                     their late fathers the Spaniards have agreed to withdraw all their troops from
                     all the waters and country of the Mississippi and Missouri, that they have
                     surrendered to us all their subjects Spanish and French settled there, and all
                     their posts and lands: that henceforward we become their fathers and friends,
                     and that we shall endeavor that they shall have no cause to lament the change.
                  </quote> In that same letter Jefferson gave Lewis the only order specifically
                  naming a tribe and the policy to be pursued with it. The president drew on sources
                  that included Jonathan Carver's <hi rend="italic">Travels through the Interior
                     Parts of North America in the Years 1766, 1767, and 1768</hi> (1778) and
                  Alexander Mackenzie's <hi rend="italic">Voyages . . . to the Frozen and Pacific
                     Oceans</hi> (1801). More immediate information came from St. Louis contacts.
                  Jefferson recognized the central role played by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> Indians in Missouri Valley trade and politics. He did not know
                  the full complexity of the system that bound together British traders, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> hunters, and village farmers, nor did he realize just how far
                  west <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> power had expanded. But the president did know that a
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> blockade on the Missouri could strangle an American fur trade
                  empire based in St. Louis. "On that nation," he commanded Lewis, "we wish most
                  particularly to make a favorable impression, because of their immense power."
                  Jefferson's claim that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands were "very desirous of being on the most friendly terms
                  with us" was mostly wishful thinking. But that exercise in hope ultimately pointed
                  the expedition toward what proved a nearly fatal confrontation with the Brulé
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>.<ref target="n0113" n="13"/>
               </p>
               <p> The expedition's success ultimately depended on friendly relations with the
                  Indians. Jefferson was not about to unleash undisciplined adventurers to ride
                  roughshod over them. Hostility between explorers and Indians could only endanger
                  lives and weaken American influence. Jefferson knew firsthand what historian
                  Charles Royster has written about American army officers in the late eighteenth
                  century. Those men "saw threats and slights everywhere and reacted with fury."<ref target="n0114" n="14"/> Fear of overreaction, especially on the part of
                  Meriwether Lewis, was also on Levi Lincoln's mind when he counseled Jefferson to
                  avoid instructions that might lead the young officer to risk his life
                  unnecessarily. "From my ideas of Capt. Lewis," wrote Lincoln, "he will be much
                  more likely, in case of difficulty, to push too far, than to recede too soon"
                  Jefferson saw the wisdom in Lincoln's comments and changed the sentence in the
                  instructions that once contained the phrase "certain destruction" to read instead
                  "we value too much the lives of our citizens to offer them to probable
                     destruction."<ref target="n0115" n="15"/> Jefferson had shown considerable
                  wisdom in making the exploration a military affair with proper organization and
                  discipline. But he did not want the bumps and bruises of wilderness travel and
                  encounters with strangers to provoke fatal overreaction. "In all your intercourse
                  with the natives treat them in the most friendly and conciliatory manner which
                  their own conduct will permit." That advice was not intended to understate the
                  potential dangers or deny the expedition the ability to defend itself. Jefferson
                  understood the hazards. What he feared was that after months of hardship and
                  frustration, some small incident might touch off a sudden burst of violence. Lewis
                  and Clark were not to court self-destruction nor were they to wreak destruction on
                  others. Survival would mean at least partial success; a glorious but futile death
                  whether by accident or at the hands of an unknown foe would spell real
                  failure.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Colonial experience taught that fruitful diplomacy and peaceful relations with
                  native people required the exchange of gifts at each meeting. French and English
                  forest diplomats learned that lesson early and did their best to offer goods of
                  substance and quality. While some Europeans may have perceived those gifts as
                  bribes to ensure compliance with treaty terms, heaps of blankets, pots, and guns
                  meant something else to the Indians. In the act of reciprocal gift giving,
                  different peoples symbolized their concern for each other. Neglecting to give
                  gifts meant failure to "brighten the chain of friendship" that bound Europeans and
                  Indians together. Giving and receiving soothed hurt feelings and reestablished
                  broken relations. By the time Jefferson created the Corps of Discovery, gifts were
                  a recognized part of the protocol of Indian diplomacy. To venture up the Missouri
                  without a carefully selected store of goods was to challenge foolishly the river
                  gods.</p>
               <p> Lewis knew the gift-giving tradition and early in 1803 made note of funds to be
                  set aside for presents for the Indians. In his initial tally of expedition costs,
                  Lewis allocated $696 for trade goods.<ref target="n0116" n="16"/> Once in
                  Philadelphia early in May 1803, he set about the task of locating and purchasing a
                  wide variety of goods. In notes made on what might be obtained as trade items,
                  Lewis demonstrated a sure grasp of frontier economics. Blue glass beads headed his
                  list of most sought-after objects. It is probable that Lewis learned from sources
                  in the Pacific Northwest fur trade that those beads were "far more valued than the
                  white beads of the same manufacture and answer[ed] all the purposes of money."
                  Second on his list were common brass buttons, which the same sources may have told
                  him were "more valued than any thing except beads." The explorer was also
                  determined to find red-handled knives of the sort used by North West Company
                  traders. Axes, tomahawks, moccasin awls, and camp kettles rounded out Lewis's
                  catalog of high priorities. In addition to those items, Lewis planned to purchase
                  substantial quantities of wampum, tobacco, and textiles. Vermilion face paint, one
                  hundred cheap rings with glass stones, and a number of pairs of scissors completed
                  his stock of essentials.<ref target="n0117" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> Using the services of Israel Whelan, purveyor of public supplies, and General
                  William Irvine, superintendent of the Schuylkill Arsenel, Lewis was able to amass
                  a substantial outfit of Indian goods. From merchants in and around Philadelphia
                  came everything from 4,600 sewing needles and 500 brooches to 8 brass kettles and
                  2,800 fishhooks. There were stocks of hawks bells, thimbles, ruffled shirts, and
                  eleven dozen of those red-handled knives. Lewis was to discover only later that
                  there were not nearly enough blue beads or brass buttons, an oversight that cost
                  the expedition dearly among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> and Chinookan Indians. And at Jefferson's direct command
                  there were two corn grinders. They were there, one might guess, for use in
                  teaching native farmers how to make pone and grits.<ref target="n0118" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p> All of the gifts stowed in the expedition's luggage for transport to St. Louis
                  had a purpose beyond diplomatic protocol. Those items, everything from ivory combs
                  to calico shirts, represented what the United States offered to potential trading
                  partners. As Jefferson repeated to every delegation of western Indians, Americans
                  sought commerce, not land. Lewis and Clark were on the road to show American
                  wares. The expedition was the mercantile and hardware display case for a trade
                  empire on the move. Moccasin awls and brass kettles were as much symbols of
                  American power as the medals and flags destined for headmen and warriors. Few of
                  those manufactured products were new to Indians, but the promise of regular
                  supplies and fair prices was bound to have some result. The Industrial Revolution
                  had come to the Missouri Valley half a century before and it was equally well
                  established on the Northwest coast. But Lewis and Clark, surrounded by bright
                  mirrors and yards of red flannel, offered more than goods. They proposed
                  membership in a system with well-established posts and dependable delivery
                  schedules. And always in the background, visible but rarely mentioned, were guns
                  and ammunition. Lewis and Clark did not carry a special supply of weapons to offer
                  for trade or as gifts, but they were not reluctant to promise firearms to
                  potential customers and allies. Although Jefferson and his explorers honestly
                  pursued intertribal peace as a requisite to trade, arming friends seemed equally
                  reasonable. What all those gifts represented was, in fact, the fundamental element
                  in Jefferson's western Indian policy. Trade and diplomacy, commerce and
                  sovereignty were all parts of the engine that drove American expansion and guided
                  the Lewis and Clark expedition.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> On a snowy day at the end of December 1803, William Clark moved into his hut at
                  what has come to be known as Camp Dubois. Situated on Wood River across the
                  Mississippi from St. Louis in present-day Illinois, the camp provided the Corps of
                  Discovery with a convenient place to prepare for the first season of exploration.
                  The winter of 1803–1804 at Camp Dubois was more than a time to fit an odd
                  lot of soldiers and frontiersmen to the discipline Lewis and Clark believed
                  essential for the expedition's success. The Wood River interlude allowed explorers
                  time to gather and evaluate a large amount of information about the Missouri River
                  Indians. That material, coming from St. Louis sources and from Jefferson himself
                  constituted a crash course in Middle and Upper Missouri tribes: their numbers,
                  locations, and possible reactions to the expedition.</p>
               <p> No other city could have provided Jefferson's explorers with such a range and
                  quality of information about the Indians. The currents of the Mississippi and
                  Missouri brought to St. Louis not only pelts and skins but a vast store of
                  knowledge and lore about the natives. Traders, merchants, government officers, and
                  rough handed engagés all had experience that could prepare Lewis and Clark
                  for their Indian duties. The explorers needed to enter quickly that St. Louis
                  world and tap its resources. That meant cultivating a friendly relationship with
                  the brothers Chouteau, Jean Pierre and René Auguste, who had come to dominate
                  the Indian trade around St. Louis and were anxious to expand their influence under
                  the new American regime. The Chouteaus and their circle of friends and relatives
                  quickly sought out the explorers. Social calls at Pierre's house combined good
                  food, friendly company, and valuable information. Clark went so far as to boast
                  that the Chouteau house became a virtual Corps of Discovery outpost during the
                     winter.<ref target="n0119" n="19"/>
               </p>
               <p> The Chouteau connection brought Lewis and Clark into contact with the city's
                  best-informed merchants. There was so much information available that Lewis found
                  it necessary to draft a form letter to give the data some structure. As he
                  explained to Jefferson, "I have proposed many quiries under sundry heads to the
                  best informed persons I have met with at St. Louis and within the vicinity of that
                  place; these gentlemen have promised me answers in due time." A list of questions
                  Lewis sent to René Auguste Chouteau early in January 1804 indicates the range
                  of information the explorer was seeking. While most of the questions referred to
                  white settlers and their current economic and political situation, there was room
                  to comment on Indians and trade matters.<ref target="n0120" n="20"/>
               </p>
               <p> Because the Chouteaus made themselves so available and accommodating to Lewis and
                  Clark, there has been a tendency to overlook others who provided vital and perhaps
                  more relevant Indian information. Chief among those were John Hay and James
                  Mackay. Hay, United States postmaster at Cahokia, was an experienced Indian trader
                  on the Mississippi. He also spoke French, and when Lewis visited St. Louis
                  commandant Carlos Dehault Delassus, Hay and his fellow trader Nicholas Jarrot went
                  along to interpret. Even more important, Hay provided the link to James Mackay.
                  Mackay was perhaps the most widely traveled of the many traders Lewis and Clark
                  met during the Camp Dubois winter. During the 1780s, Mackay explored the
                  Assiniboine and Mouse rivers and visited the Mandan villages, along with North
                  West Company employees from Fort Esperance on the Qu'Appelle River. By the
                  mid-1790s the Scot had switched his political loyalties and was employed by the
                  St. Louis-based and Spanish-controlled Missouri Company. When he met Clark early
                  in 1804, Mackay had already ascended the Missouri River as far as the Omaha
                  Indians in what is now Dakota County, Nebraska. Even more important, he had sent
                  his Welsh lieutenant, John Evans, to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and had entertained notions of sending Evans across the
                  mountains to the Pacific. Mackay's call at Camp Dubois on January 10, 1804,
                  brought a lifetime of information on native people and Indian-white relations on
                  the northern plains. Although Clark did not record what passed between the two
                  explorers, there can be little doubt that their conversation was enlivened by
                  Mackay's rich supply of experiences with the Indians.<ref target="n0121" n="21"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark recognized that men like Hay, Mackay, and the Chouteaus could
                  offer invaluable information. But there were other sources of information in St.
                  Louis, men of the river perhaps less literate but with more immediate experience
                  among Indians. Lewis and Clark needed that sort of firsthand knowledge. While the
                  captains could question their own engagés, some of whom had logged
                  considerable river time, there were others beyond easy reach. As Lewis explained
                  it to Jefferson, "Some of the traders of this country from their continued
                  intercourse with the Indians, possess with more accuracy many interesting
                  particulars in relation to that people, than persons in a higher sphere of life."
                  The problem was that those men lacked "both leasure and abilities to give this
                  information in any satisfactory manner in detail." Determined to get that
                  material, Lewis hit upon the idea of drawing "a form of paper containing 13 or 14
                  columns," each headed with a different topic relating to native people. Lewis had
                  already circulated such forms by late December 1803 and felt certain that his plan
                  would yield important data. The questionnaires may have proved successful, but
                  unfortunately, neither blank forms nor completed ones have survived.<ref target="n0122" n="22"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark got more than talk from their St. Louis contacts. Friendly
                  meetings brought maps and journals produced by earlier expeditions up the
                  Missouri. Of all the written material the explorers were able to study, none was
                  more valuable for its Indian content than the journals and notes produced by James
                  Mackay and John Evans. In a letter to Jefferson, Lewis reported that he had
                  obtained Evans and Mackay's journal material dating from 1795 to 1797. Those
                  entries, written in French, were being translated by the ever-useful John Hay.<ref target="n0123" n="23"/> No explorer destined for the northern plains could miss
                  the import of those documents. Taken together, the Evans-Mackay file made several
                  major points. There was the prospect of a rich trade to be exploited among both
                  villagers and nomads. But success in that trade hinged on a reliable system with
                  dependable Indian partners. Lewis and Clark could not have missed Evans and
                  Mackay's singling out of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> as the Indians most helpful to traders. "The Mandaines," wrote
                  James Mackay, "as well all other nations that inhabit to their West, near the
                  Rocky Mountains, are in general people as good as they are mild who lay a great
                  value on the friendship of the Whites." The Evans-Mackay material also revealed
                  the extent of international competition for trade on the Missouri. French,
                  Spanish, and English interests were already on the river, and reading Evans and
                  Mackay reminded the explorers that their diplomacy would be for high stakes.
                  Mackay's observation that courting the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> could "put a Stop to the unjust progress of the English" was
                  written for Spanish eyes, but its meaning was not lost on the Americans.<ref target="n0124" n="24"/> Finally, the Evans-Mackay journals brought home how
                  much Indian opposition might be provoked by an American trade empire based in St.
                  Louis. The Omahas, Arikaras, and some of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands had already made life miserable for traders bound upriver.
                  Lewis and Clark would have to deal with Indians who assumed it was their right to
                  collect tolls on the Missouri highway.</p>
               <p> The Evans and Mackay materials were of such great importance that Lewis and Clark
                  probably took along Hay's translation of Mackay's journal. It is more certain that
                  a second document from Mackay made the transcontinental passage. Sometime during
                  the winter at Camp Dubois Mackay's "Notes on Indian Tribes" came into the
                  possession of the expedition. That twelve-page report summarized the trader's
                  early experiences with the Piegans and his 1787 visit to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. In the "Notes" Mackay offered a blend of current opinion on
                  the origin and condition of the Indians and his own observations of their ways. He
                  had something chatty to say on everything from religion to burials. Most important
                  for the expedition's purposes, the trader made astute comments on the lives of the
                  Missouri River villagers. Drawing on his own visit to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Evans's experiences with the Arikaras and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, Mackay briefly described the construction of earth lodges, the
                  layout of towns, and the yearly patterns of farming and hunting. Mackay's "Notes"
                  was yet another text in Lewis and Clark's education.<ref target="n0125" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> The last piece of written material on Indian subjects had a St. Louis source but
                  came to Lewis and Clark from Jefferson. In his November 16 letter to Lewis, the
                  president sent along extracts from the Missouri River trade journal attributed to
                  Jean Baptiste Truteau. Working for the Company of Explorers of the Upper Missouri,
                  Truteau traded upriver as far as the Arikaras from 1794 to 1796. What Jefferson
                  sent was a compilation of the tribes living along the Missouri and its
                  tributaries. By studying the list, Lewis and Clark could gain further information
                  about their numbers and locations. Many tribes that figured in the expedition's
                  future were briefly noted in the journal. Those included the Otos, Omahas, the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands, Arikaras, and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Although the extracts did not plainly spell out the complex
                  relations between those groups, Lewis and Clark were at least beginning to fix
                  peoples and places in the mental geography of the expedition.<ref target="n0126" n="26"/>
               </p>
               <p> Establishing hunting territories and village locations in their minds was made
                  easier by several important maps Lewis and Clark examined during the winter at
                  Camp Dubois. When Clark gathered and compared maps, he was primarily in search of
                  information to guide the expedition over the best route to the Pacific. But Clark,
                  who emerged as the expedition's cartographer, could not have missed the
                  substantial body of Indian data contained in many of the maps he studied. Three
                  maps in particular held valuable information on village sites and native
                  populations. Those maps gave visual expression to the written material coming into
                  Lewis and Clark's hands.</p>
               <p> Among the maps that the explorers looked at was one Lewis described as "a general
                  map of Uper Louisiana." It had been drawn by Antoine Soulard, surveyor general of
                  Spanish Louisiana. Soulard prepared the Spanish version in 1794–95 at the
                  direction of Governor Carondelet to guide the explorations of Jean Baptiste
                  Truteau. Sometime after the journeys of Mackay and Evans, Soulard drafted versions
                  of the map with English and French legends. It was the English version, entitled
                  "A Topographical Sketch of the Missouri and Upper Mississippi Exhibiting the
                  Various Nations and Tribes who inhabit the Country," that now came into Clark's
                  possession. Soulard's map demonstrated with remarkable accuracy the locations of
                  western Indians at the end of the eighteenth century. Along the Missouri and its
                  tributaries Soulard placed the Oto, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnee</ref>, and Omaha peoples. Using simple circle and triangle symbols,
                  the surveyor general noted Arikara and Mandan villages and the territories of
                  nomadic <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, and Assiniboins. Farther north Soulard sites the Blackfeet
                  and Chipewyans. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref> and Snakes (<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>) marked the western limit of St. Louis knowledge. Looking at
                  Soulard's map must have been a reassuring experience for the explorers: it showed
                  the headwaters of the Missouri within easy travel to what Soulard labeled "Oregan
                  or R. of the West." Indians that Lewis and Clark had heard about from St. Louis
                  traders were on the map and in the expected places. This was not a map to chart a
                  daily course on the river, but it did offer the sort of overview of the tribes
                  that the explorers would need for much of their diplomacy. And because such
                  diplomacy was closely linked to trade, Soulard's careful delineation of trade
                  routes was a valuable bonus.<ref target="n0127" n="27"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark certainly could have extracted a good deal of ethnographic
                  information from the map. But at its best Soulard's creation did not reflect the
                  kinds of immediate river and Indian contact the explorers sought. That sort of
                  information could come only from maps drawn by James Mackay and John Evans. After
                  Clark wrote to Indiana territorial governor William Henry Harrison seeking his
                  help in locating accurate western maps, Harrison sent Mackay's chart of the
                  Missouri from St. Charles to the Mandan villages. While having a far narrower
                  range than the Soulard map, Mackay's work did offer a precise, firsthand view of
                  tribes and villages along the river. Mackay's sequence of Indian sites on the
                  Missouri was essentially correct, but his location of the Mandan villages at
                  longitude 110° west put those earth lodges some four hundred miles farther
                  west than they actually were. Whatever its geographical misconceptions, the Mackay
                  map brought Lewis and Clark another step closer to knowing what Indians were
                  around the next bend in the river.<ref target="n0128" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> The Mackay map was an important addition to the expedition's understanding of the
                  plains landscape and its people. But a map made by John Evans became what one
                  recent scholar has called a major "road map" for the expedition for no less than
                  seven hundred miles.<ref target="n0129" n="29"/> The Evans map of the Missouri
                  River consisted of seven sheets depicting the course of the river and the location
                  of the Omaha, Ponca, Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa villages. Those places along the
                  river frequented by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands were also noted. By examining the Evans map along with the
                  ones by Soulard and Mackay, Lewis and Clark could know with some certainty what
                  Indian would be encountered next. The Evans map was taken on the voyage and became
                  an invaluable tool for both navigation and diplomacy. All these maps completed
                  what might be termed the expedition's academic education in the Indian geography
                  of the Missouri Valley. The maps, journals, and river talk could not lessen the
                  shock of encounter that lay ahead, but they might at least give the explorers a
                  sense of the predictable in an uncertain land.</p>
               <p> The first test of that education came even before leaving Camp Dubois. The Indian
                  presents so carefully purchased in Philadelphia needed to be organized in some
                  logical order. It made good sense to package trade goods, medals, flags, and fancy
                  dress uniforms in the order in which they were to be distributed. Here again John
                  Hay proved indispensable. As an experienced trader he knew the finer points of
                  packaging and merchandising. It was probably Hay who suggested putting a variety
                  of gifts into bags protected by waterproof fabric. Those bags were first divided
                  into two general groups, one for the Indians on the river up to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and a second set for "foreign nations." All told, there were to
                  be twenty-one bags of Indian goods. As Hay worked on packing in late April 1804,
                  the explorers showed that they had learned their lessons well. Bundles were made
                  up for the Otos, Poncas, and Omahas. Knowing the great power of Omaha leaders like
                  the late Chief Blackbird, they set aside a separate part of one bag for the
                  leading Omaha chief. That bag had everything from a pair of scarlet leggings to a
                  military officer's coat and American flag. There were similar bags for the
                  Arikaras and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. For those Indians beyond the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> there were five bales stuffed with peace medals, fancy
                  handkerchiefs, hat bands, and mirrors.<ref target="n0130" n="30"/> The careful
                  order in which those bales were packed annd numbered testified to how much Lewis
                  and Clark had learned during the months at Camp Dubois. On paper, at least, they
                  knew the human contours of the land ahead. Those neatly tied packages should have
                  been reassuring. But Clark was not confident. Just one day before leaving Camp
                  Dubois he looked at the presents and thought they were "not as much as I think
                  necessary for the multitude of Indians thro which we must pass on our road across
                  the Continent."<ref target="n0131" n="31"/>

               <p> As the Lewis and Clark flotilla—keelboat and pirogues—rocked against
                  the river current, it represented months of careful preparation. Armed with calico
                  shirts, peace medals, and blank vocabulary sheets, the expedition seemed ready to
                  carry out its many Indian missions. But there was still one unanswered question,
                  one nagging doubt that no talk, map, or journal could resolve. How would the
                  explorers cope with the inevitable tensions hidden in dozens of encounters with
                  the Indians? Clark had long recognized the dangers. While working out travel
                  schedules, he admitted that the accuracy of those time tables depended on "the
                  probability of an oppisition from roving parties of Bad Indians which it is
                  probable may be on the R[iver]."<ref target="n0132" n="32"/> Unchecked emotions,
                  moments of fury from either Indians or explorers, could cost lives and destroy the
                  expedition. Perhaps the greatest uncharted space ahead was a human space.</p>
               <p> Into that emptiness went men of diverse backgrounds and unknown temperaments.
                  Young frontiersmen recruited by Clark might have been crack shots, but would
                  memories of Indian warfare on the dark and bloody ground of Kentucky boil up
                  whenever they saw Indians? The expedition matched young privates like George
                  Shannon with old hands Hugh Hall and the Field brothers Joseph and Reuben. St.
                  Louis engagés added river wisdom and colorful songs to the Corps. Among them
                  François Labiche and Pierre Cruzatte stood out for their two winters spent at
                  the mouth of the Nodaway River some 450 miles up the Missouri. Towering over them
                  all as a frontiersman was George Drouillard. Born of French and Shawnee parents,
                  he had spent years in the Illinois country. Woodsman, tracker, adept at sign
                  language, Drouillard emerged as the expedition's chief hunter and scout. Young
                  John Colter could not have had a better teacher. New Hampshire-born John Ordway
                  quickly caught the captains' attention and became the Corps of Discovery's
                  sergeant major. And there was York, Clark's slave, whose blackness would fascinate
                  and frighten so many Indians.</p>
               <p> Finally, there were the captains themselves. Despite Jefferson's assertion that
                  Lewis was chosen for his "familiarity with the Indian character," the young
                  officer had neither fought Indians nor lived with them.<ref target="n0133" n="33"/> He spoke no Indian languages. Jefferson's library might have been filled with
                  books about Indians, but there is no direct evidence that Lewis read any of those
                  volumes. His contacts with Benjamin Rush and other Philadelphia students of native
                  cultures were all too brief. In fact, Lewis's frontier experience was limited to
                  travel in the Ohio country on missions for army paymasters and recruiters. Those
                  journeys gave Lewis firsthand knowledge of the officer corps—one of the
                  reasons Jefferson selected him as private secretary—but they did not fit him
                  to negotiate with confident chiefs and experienced warriors. Clark's life as
                  soldier and surveyor did bring him into direct contact with Indians. Unlike many
                  in his position, he had become an acute observer of native life and a confidant of
                  chiefs and warriors—both ethnographer and diplomat. In ways that are beyond
                  easy explanation, he enjoyed the company of Indians. Throughout his life Clark
                  courted them, smoked with them, and shared food and stories with them. But this
                  personal history was just a beginning. The expedition was to challenge each man in
                  ways yet unimagined. Surveying their untested crew and themselves, Lewis and Clark
                  could only hope that the patience, skill, and courage of some would sustain all
                  until the Corps of Discovery found its own soul.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> The "road across the Continent" began in mid-May 1804 as the expedition steadily
                  left behind the familiar sights of Camp Dubois and St. Louis. In the days that
                  followed there was time for a green crew to learn the dangers of falling banks,
                  swirling currents, and hidden sawyers that could rip and overturn a craft. Those
                  first weeks on the river brought reminders that the fur trade already reached far
                  up the Missouri. The explorers saw rafts and canoes filled with furs from the
                  Omaha and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnee</ref> villages. River traffic also brought the expedition
                  some valuable information. Late in May, around the isolated village of La
                  Charette, the explorers met Régis Loisel. A prominent member of the Missouri
                  Fur Company, he was on his way back downriver after establishing a post to garner
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara trade. The experienced Loisel gave Lewis
                  and Clark "a good Deel of information" about Indian relations far up the Missouri.
                  He may well have urged the explorers to obtain additional aid from his partners
                  Pierre Antoine Tabeau and Joseph Garreau at their Cedar Island post.<ref target="n0134" n="34"/>
               </p>
               <p> Early in June there was another fortunate meeting, this time with an Indian
                  language interpreter. The expedition was not well prepared to deal with
                  translation problems, especially those involving important conferences with the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Pierre Cruzatte knew a few words and phrases and there were
                  Drouillard's signs. Coming upon another St. Louis-bound party of traders, the
                  captains met Pierre Dorion. The Frenchman had spent some twenty years with the
                  Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and their neighbors. He was just the sort of agent
                  Lewis and Clark needed to interpret at crucial conferences and to organize
                  important delegations. Dorion was promptly hired with the understanding that he
                  would remain with the Yanktons to promote the expedition's Indian policy.<ref target="n0135" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p> By the last days of July the expedition had passed the mouth of the Platte River,
                  known to old river hands as the dividing line between the lower Missouri and the
                  middle reach of the river. Mosquitoes, gnats, and a prairie landscape were all
                  unmistakable signs of the expedition's progress. Information gathered at St. Louis
                  and the words of engagés told Lewis and Clark to prepare for their first
                  meetings with Indians. Along these parts of the river the explorers expected to
                  see Oto, Missouri, Omaha, Ponca, and perhaps <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnee</ref> Indians. On July 20, camped above present-day Nebraska City,
                  Nebraska, Clark speculated that from his location a man could walk in two days to
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref> on the Platte and in one day to the Otos. Those
                  Indians ought to be close at hand. Perhaps it was Labiche or Cruzatte who told
                  Clark that at this time of year most river folk left their villages to hunt
                  buffalo. Those hunts threatened to scuttle expedition diplomacy even before it was
                     launched.<ref target="n0136" n="36"/>
               </p>
               <p> Two days later, some ten miles above the Platte, Lewis and Clark settled into a
                  place on the Iowa side of the Missouri with the delightful name of Camp White
                  Catfish. From that spot the explorers planned to send out parties to invite
                  Indians for formal talks. On July 23 George Drouillard and Pierre Cruzatte were
                  given parcels of tobacco and ordered to find the Otos and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref>. Some signs, undisclosed in expeditionary records, suggested
                  that at least a few river Indians had returned from hunting to obtain additional
                  corn supplies. Taking this as a hopeful sign, Lewis and Clark confidently raised a
                  flagstaff and waited anxiously for their native guests. Those preparations ended
                  suddenly two days later when Drouillard and Cruzatte returned with unwelcome news.
                  They had quickly found the major Oto town but it was quite empty. There were some
                  traces of a small Indian party in the area, but neither scout could locate it.
                  Disappointed and concerned, Lewis and Clark decided to press upriver in the hope
                  that they might still come upon some Indians.<ref target="n0137" n="37"/>
               </p>
               <p> The expedition's fortunes took a change for the better on July 28 when Drouillard
                  happened on a Missouri Indian. Once back at the expedition's camp, the Indian
                  revealed that his own band was quite small, no more than twenty lodges. Their
                  numbers now seriously depleted by smallpox, the surviving Missouris lived with the
                  Otos. The main body of Otos was still out hunting. Acting on that information, the
                  captains sent the engagé La Liberté, who could speak the Oto language,
                  back with the Indian to deliver a formal council invitation. The expedition
                  planned to continue upriver and the Otos could find them farther along. At the end
                  of July, in bottomland on the west bank of the river at what became Fort Atkinson,
                  Nebraska, the expedition once again halted and waited for the Indians.<ref target="n0138" n="38"/>
               </p>
               <p> After two days of patient waiting, Lewis and Clark were plainly worried. They
                  knew it might take some time for "much scatred" hunters to be located and to make
                  their way to the river. Nonetheless, Clark could not help admitting, "We fear
                  Something amiss with our messenger or them." The captains sent out another man to
                  hurry La Liberté and the Otos.<ref target="n0139" n="39"/> All that worry
                  vanished at sunset on August 2 when a party of Otos and Missouris appeared at the
                  Council Bluff camp. Along with them was a trader whose name Clark rendered as
                  Fairfong, although he has never been properly identified. Fairfong knew the Otos
                  and had their trust. The leading Oto and Missouri chiefs, Little Thief and Big
                  Horse, were not with the delegation but Lewis and Clark were gratified to see six
                  headmen. At dusk the explorers arranged a hasty greeting, sent gifts of roasted
                  meat, and asked the Indians to attend a council the next day.<ref target="n0140" n="40"/>
               </p>
               <p> As fog hung in the river bottoms on Friday morning, August 3, Lewis and Clark set
                  about preparing for their first conference with the Indians. What the explorers
                  did that morning linked them to generations of forest diplomats. The form and
                  substance were dictated by common expectations resulting from years of woodland
                  encounters. It was the sort of ritual Clark had seen at the council negotiating
                  the Treaty of Greenville with General Anthony Wayne in 1795. If the subsequent
                  history of the expedition is any guide, Lewis spent those early hours finishing
                  his draft of a long speech proclaiming American sovereignty and the coming of new
                  traders. Clark may well have spent the same time supervising the preparation of
                  gifts. Opening bale number thirty, the men took out red leggings, fancy dress
                  coats, and blue blankets. Setting aside flags and medals, they carefully packed
                  the trade goods in individual bundles whose size and quality were determined by
                  the rank of each chief. A special package was made up for the absent chief Little
                  Thief. Although gifts and speeches had long been part of any Indian meeting,
                  warriors and soldiers always made it a point to show military prowess as well.
                  Lewis and Clark were determined to impress every Indian they met with the power of
                  the young republic. Sergeants Ordway, Floyd, and Pryor must have been busy that
                  morning readying their squads for a formal dress parade. At the same time, other
                  men were detailed to convert the keelboat's main sail into a temporary awning to
                  shield the diplomats from the August sun. A flag and flagstaff completed the
                  setting. What would become routine in the months ahead was still new and fresh,
                  and there must have been an electric excitement in camp as the Corps of Discovery
                  waited for the Indians to arrive.</p>
               <p> At midmorning the Oto and Missouri delegation, with trader Fairfong in tow,
                  assembled under the sailcloth awning to watch something like a Lewis and Clark
                  Medicine Show. At the command, the expedition's troops shouldered arms, dressed
                  right, and passed in review. Lewis then stepped forward to deliver a long speech
                  summarizing federal Indian policy. Because its language and themes were to be
                  repeated many times in the coming months, the speech is worth careful
                  attention.</p>
               <p> Lewis began with the grand announcement of American sovereignty over the newly
                  purchased lands. The Otos and Missouris were told bluntly that their Spanish and
                  French fathers had retreated beyond the eastern sea and would never return. In
                  their place was a new father, the "great chief of the Seventeen nations," and it
                  was his will that all would "now form one common family with us." Explaining the
                  nature of the expedition's mission always proved a difficult task; the first time
                  Lewis tried it the best he could do was declare that the explorers were on the
                  river "to clear the road, remove every obstruction, and make it a road of peace."
                  Just who was to mark out that "road of peace" and where it might lead were matters
                  Lewis addressed next. Urging the Indians to "shut [their] ears to the councils of
                  Bad birds," the diplomat insisted that the new American father and his sons would
                  bring peace and prosperity to "red children on the troubled waters." Those "red
                  children" were required to make peace with their neighbors and trade with St.
                  Louis merchants. If those words were heeded, advised Lewis, traders would come, a
                  post would be built near the mouth of the Platte, and the Indians would "obtain
                  goods on much better terms than . . . before." But Lewis's words had the edge of
                  threat as well. If river Indians ignored American orders and followed the "bad
                  birds," trade would be cut off and there would be much suffering.</p>
               <p> Lewis concluded with what he saw as a crucial test of native willingness to
                  accept the new order. He urged Oto and Missouri chiefs to form a delegation to
                  visit the great Washington chief. Those delegates could see for themselves both
                  the wealth of the American nation and the contentment of Indians already living
                  under the federal father. And if they submitted to the great chief, those in the
                  delegation would be showerd with gifts and honors. Declaring that the traders of
                  yesterday were gone, Lewis held out Jefferson and the American nation as "the only
                  friend to whom you can now look for protection."<ref target="n0141" n="41"/>
               </p>
               <p> Because chiefs like Little Thief and Big Horse were not in camp, the responses
                  offered by those Indians who were present did not capture much of the expedition's
                  attention. But what fragments are in the record remain important to gauge early
                  native reaction to Lewis and Clark. Patrick Gass, soon to become a sergeant after
                  the untimely death of Charles Floyd, said that the Indians were "well pleased"
                  with the change in government. But that supposed pleasure at seeing new fathers
                  was not widely felt by tribes along the lower river. Generated by news of the
                  Louisiana Purchase, rumors had been flying for months that the Americans would
                  radically change trading rules. In December 1804 a fearful Osage came to Camp
                  Dubois filled with stories from an English trader who alleged that once the
                  Americans had the country, trade would be disrupted.<ref target="n0142" n="42"/>
                  The reaction of some Osages on the Arkansas River was even more forceful. When a
                  Chouteau agent announced the purchase, his letter was seized and burned, "the
                  Indians not believing that the Americans had possession of the Countrey."<ref target="n0143" n="43"/> Some Otos and their neighbors, who got goods from
                  traders of various nationalities, may well have shared those concerns. The
                  delegates at Council Bluff did nothing so dramatic, but they may have wondered
                  about the economic consequences of new flags and medals hearing unfamiliar faces.
                  In fact, what the chiefs did talk about was trade. The Otos and their neighbors
                  wanted a dependable source of goods. After years of spotty contact with English
                  and French traders, the Indians were intent on finding and joining a reliable
                  system. Complaining that Spanish and French traders "never gave them as much as a
                  knife for nothing," it was plain that the Otos and Missouris hoped the Americans
                  would be more generous. Although Clark was unimpressed with the replies, calling
                  the chiefs "no oreters," Ordway found the speeches "very sensable."</p>
               <p> The day ended with more gifts—powder, whiskey, face paint, and fancy
                  garters—and ceremony. Peace medals were distributed and Lewis gave the first
                  of many airgun demonstrations. That silent weapon was impressive, but promises of
                  trade meant more to the assembled Indians. And if the explorers could negotiate a
                  peace between the feuding Otos and Omahas, that would surely add to American
                  prestige. The Indians were both cautious and interested and Lewis and Clark
                  finished the meeting with a sense of achievement. Although Little Thief and Big
                  Horse had not spoken, the captains were confident that the wisdom of American
                  policy, the lure of St. Louis trade, and the force of federal arms would
                     prevail.<ref target="n0144" n="44"/>
               </p>
               <p> Several days later Lewis and Clark followed up what they viewed as an initial
                  diplomatic success by sending a copy of Lewis's speech and a parcel of gifts to
                  Little Thief. That an equally suitable gift and a medal of proper grade were not
                  sent to the Missouri chief Big Horse was an oversight due to the hurry to press
                  upriver. The party transporting the goods was instructed to ask the Otos to send a
                  delegation toward the Omaha village, there to cement good relations. By August 12
                  the expedition had passed the hilltop grave of the mighty Omaha chief Blackbird
                  near present-day Macy, Nebraska, and expected to meet his successors at any
                  moment. While the main body of the expedition stopped to prepare for an Omaha
                  council, Ordway was sent to find the Indians. At Omaha Creek near present-day
                  Homer, Nebraska, Ordway and his squad walked into the empty village of
                  Tonwantonga. In the 1790s, during the years of Blackbird's leadership, the earth
                  lodge village had held over one thousand Omahas. But the smallpox epidemic of
                  1800–1801 had dramatically reduced those numbers. Tonwantonga was vacant now
                  as the Omahas were on the plains hunting buffalo. Although the Omahas were less
                  powerful in the face of mounting <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> influence, their absence from home was a major disappointment.
                  Any hope of negotiating an Oto-Omaha peace and bringing the Omahas into the St.
                  Louis trade system now seemed remote. Equally worrisome was the continued absence
                  of the Oto and Missouri chiefs and the expedition party sent to find them.<ref target="n0145" n="45"/>
               </p>
               <p> At least some of those problems were resolved on August 17. By this time the
                  party had moved further up the Missouri, edging toward modern-day <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> City, Iowa. Toward evening François Labiche came into camp;
                  he had been with the group sent to find the Otos and track down a deserter, Moses
                  Reed. He reported that the rest of the party, including Reed and the chiefs Little
                  Thief and Big Horse, would arrive the next day. Labiche further explained that the
                  Indians were intent on making peace with the Omahas. "As the Omahas are not at
                  home," sourly wrote William Clark, "this great Object cannot be accomplished at
                  the time." The explorers could only hope that this would not deter the Otos from
                  accepting American proposals.<ref target="n0146" n="46"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the following afternoon both the deserter and the chiefs came to camp. Making
                  some shade near the keelboat, the captains briefly entertained the Indians before
                  moving on to more immediate business—the trial of Moses Reed. As Little
                  Thief and the rest watched intently, Reed was tried, found guilty, and sentenced
                  to run the gauntlet four times. Shocked by this spectacle of public punishment and
                  humiliation, the chiefs asked that Reed be pardoned. Had it not been for the need
                  to establish firm discipline early in the voyage, Lewis and Clark might have
                  sought to satisfy the visitors by granting their request. But it was not to be,
                  and after they carefully explained the reasons for such punishment, the whole
                  unhappy affair was done.</p>
               <p> Even if the Omahas could not be part of the coming council, Lewis and Clark were
                  anxious to know the reasons for trouble between those Indians and the Otos. Little
                  Thief and Big Horse found no reason to conceal causes for the tensions. The chiefs
                  promptly gave a quick lecture on the river realities of raid and truce. If the
                  Americans expected Oto-Omaha conflict to turn on high policy disputes that could
                  be settled by formal treaty, they were sorely mistaken. What unfolded was the tale
                  of a horse-stealing raid by two Missouri warriors against the Omahas. The
                  adventure had gone awry and in the fighting that followed, both men had been
                  killed. Their deaths demanded retaliation. The Otos and Missouris also had stormy
                  relations with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref>. The chiefs admitted that theft of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnee</ref> corn while those people were off buffalo hunting was sufficient
                  reason to fear revenge. What Little Thief recited were the common clashes that
                  shaped prairie life. None of that denied the issues of trade and the struggles of
                  the Otos, Omahas, and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> to secure that trade. But the Oto chief was offering a vision of
                  the oridinary, the kind of affairs that Lewis and Clark had neither the time nor
                  the talent to understand and control. The explorers listened but did not seem to
                  comprehend. They were already prisoners of grand but ill-conceived designs to
                  reshape Missouri Valley Indian politics and economics to the requirements of
                  American policy and commerce. The realities of personal insult and family revenge
                  must have seemed petty by comparison. Yet those were the human passions that
                  outlived all official plans from any new father. Even so, that evening, as
                  everyone enjoyed a dance and an extra gill of whiskey to celebrate Lewis's
                  birthday, problems personal and national seemed far away.<ref target="n0147" n="47"/>
               </p>
               <p> How different the Indian and expedition agendas were became plain the next day.
                  Assembled under a shade awning, chiefs and warriors listened as Lewis again
                  explained American plans for intertribal peace and trade from St. Louis. Only bits
                  and pieces of the replies from Little Thief and Big Horse have survived, but what
                  was recorded strongly suggests Indian expectations that did not match American
                  designs. Little Thief agreed that peace would benefit all. He said that the Otos
                  had always been friendly with white traders, whether they were English or French.
                  What counted, so argued the chief, was not nationality but the price and quality
                  of trade goods. Lewis and Clark could not have been pleased to learn that along
                  the river the Stars and Stripes meant no more than the Union Jack or the Spanish
                  ensign. Adding demand to insult, Little Thief wanted generous gifts from the hand
                  of the new father. Big Horse added to the growing confusion by insisting that
                  without "a spoonful of your milk"—a polite way to ask for alcohol—his
                  younger warriors could not be restrained from attacking the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref> and Omahas. Whiskey for peace was not the price the expedition
                  was prepared to pay, nor was it diplomacy on the level of virtue expected by
                  Jefferson. And hard on this demand came a call from Little Thief for a delegation
                  led by the trader Fairfong and François Labiche to make peace with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref>. When this request was flatly rejected, all talk ended in
                  sullen silence.</p>
               <p> Uncertain of their next move and fearing that the whole conference might dissolve
                  in confusion, the captains decided that gifts, medals, and certificates of good
                  behavior might appease the Indians. Parcels of tobacco, beads, and face paint were
                  quickly distributed. Medals and certificates went to warriors like Big Axe and
                  Black Cat. But those well-intentioned items sparked fresh misunderstanding. When
                  the explorers had prepared bundles of trade goods and medals for chiefs who had
                  not attended the August 3 gathering, they had not realized the approximate
                  equality of status between Little Thief and Big Horse. The Missouri chief had been
                  sent a medal of lesser grade, and he now required one fitting his position. No
                  sooner had that been accomplished than there was trouble in the ranks of the
                  warriors. These men had expected substantial gifts and had received pieces of
                  printed paper instead. No matter that the document proclaimed each Indian a
                  "friend and ally" of the United States. One plainly disgusted warrior named Big
                  Blue Eyes made it clear what he wanted and abruptly handed back the certificate.
                  Some moments later the Oto had second thoughts and asked that it be returned.
                  Angered at what seemed a lack of respect for official documents, Lewis and Clark
                  refused and "rebuked them very roughly for having in object goods and not peace
                  with their neighbors." Those pointed words may have been an accurate estimate of
                  Oto and Missouri priorities, but they were hardly salve for bruised feelings.
                  Little Thief finally put the matter to rest and asked that Big Blue Eyes be
                  restored to the expedition's good graces. Not so quick to forgive, the explorers
                  handed the paper to Little Thief, saying that he could present it to the offending
                  warrior.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark had expected the Indians' quick acceptance of American policies.
                  All the gifts and military show were aimed at producing that result. On the other
                  hand, the Otos and Missouris imagined wonderful giveaways of valuable goods from
                  what seemed an endless supply on the keelboat. Little Thief and the other chiefs
                  knew that their influence was in decline as <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and upriver villagers garnered a steadily larger share of the
                  trade. Each expected too much from the other, and the day seemed to be ending in
                  squabble and petty dispute. Trying to conclude the conference on a positive note,
                  the explorers initiated a second round of gifts. Whiskey, keelboat curiosities
                  like the ever impressive magnet and telescope, and an airgun show ended the
                  council. Or at least Lewis and Clark thought that the gathering was finished.
                  Discontented with skimpy presents, many Indians remained in camp asking for
                  whiskey and trade items. What had been planned as an impressive day of solemn talk
                  and American power tailed off in misunderstanding and confusion. Lewis and Clark
                  were not about to alter either their goals or their tactics, but what happened in
                  the Oto-Missouri talks should have been a warning of difficulties ahead.<ref target="n0148" n="48"/>
               </p>
               <p> The meetings with the Oto and Missouri Indians were the first tests of the
                  expedition's diplomatic skill. They were also a time to learn patience in the face
                  of those who found the explorers' proposals either incomprehensible or confusing.
                  Those August councils produced mixed results. Lewis and Clark might announce
                  American sovereignty and assert that trade contacts were established, that sites
                  were marked for future posts, and that intertribal peace was being promoted. The
                  Corps of Discovery might be learning to live with the Indians. But a closer look
                  makes those assertions appear less substantial. The Otos and their neighbors
                  wanted trade. With what nation and under whose flag mattered not at all. Promises
                  of peace with nearby Indians, no matter how honestly made, bound no one. As the
                  expedition made its way up the Missouri and into Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> territory, Lewis and Clark could realistically claim little
                  success. They were now entering a plains world infinitely more complex than any
                  they had encountered on the lower river.</p>
               <p> On August 27, as the expedition passed the mouth of the James River, an Indian
                  boy swam out to hail one of the pirogues. When the Americans pulled their boats on
                  shore, two more Indian youths appeared. These Indians—two Yanktons and an
                  Omaha—told Lewis and Clark that there was a large Yankton camp not far up
                  the James. Eager to talk with these Indians, the captains sent Pierre Dorion and
                  Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> village. Toward evening Pryor and Dorion reached the Yankton camp
                  and received an enthusiastic welcome. Following tradition, the Yanktons wanted to
                  carry Pryor into camp on a buffalo robe. It was to be more than a ride; it was a
                  sign of honor and distinction. But the sergeant hastily declined, explaining that
                  he was not the owner of the great boat now on the river. The Yanktons were not to
                  be denied, however, and Pryor and Dorion were treated to a feast of fat dog, yet
                  another sign of special attention.<ref target="n0149" n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p> The warm greeting extended to Pryor mirrored the Yankton's eagerness to talk with
                  Lewis and Clark. All of this was genuine hospitality and something more. What lay
                  behind the offered buffalo robe procession and dog dinner were Yankton concerns
                  about their own role in a rapidly changing plains world. The Yanktons did trade to
                  the east with North West Company posts and had occasional visits from St. Louis
                  merchants, but they needed a place in some dependable commercial system. They also
                  needed protection from their more aggressive neighbors the Tetons. When Dorion,
                  now joined by his son Pierre, and Pryor brought the Yankton delegation to the
                  Missouri shore opposite Calumet Bluff, both the Indians and the explorers
                  anticipated a successful meeting.</p>
               <p> The morning of August 30 found the Corps of Discovery camped at Calumet Bluff on
                  the west side of the river at the site of today's Gavins Point Dam. As the sun
                  burned off an early fog, the explorers busied themselves with council
                  preparations. What had been done for the Otos and Missouris was now readied for
                  the Yanktons. Even before breakfast, some inquisitive Yanktons swam the river to
                  watch the mysterious doings of the bearded strangers. At 9:00 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.M.</hi> Lewis and Clark were ready to begin their first conference with the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. While the Oto and Missouri meetings were important as first
                  forays in frontier diplomacy, the explorers knew that talks with any <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> group would be of lasting significance. If the American fur trade
                  empire was to move from the realm of Jefferson's imagination to commercial
                  reality, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> cooperation and participation were essential. Knowing
                  all that, Lewis and Clark dispatched a pirogue across the river to begin the
                  proceedings.</p>
               <p> If the stakes were high for American diplomacy in the new West, they were equally
                  high for the Yanktons. Chiefs like Weuche and White Crane made that plain as they
                  entered the precincts of Calumet Bluff in high ceremony. The whole Yankton
                  delegation was preceded by four musicians, singing and playing as they paraded
                  through the camp. That sense of drama was heightened when the captains ordered the
                  bow swivel gun on the keelboat fired. Ritual payments of tobacco were made to the
                  musicians; the conferees shook hands and then sat down to hear Lewis present the
                  American proposals. His speech, translated by Pierre Dorion, Sr., lasted until
                  late in the afternoon. The expedition's records do not contain a full text of the
                  speech, but some clues in Ordway's journal suggest that it focused on peace with
                  the Otos and Missouris and on arranging a major delegation of chiefs from several
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands. Probably, Lewis proclaimed American sovereignty and
                  promised reliable trade from St. Louis. When the speech ended, Lewis and Clark
                  handed out medals to five of the Yankton chiefs. Weuche, sometimes known as La
                  Liberator or the Handshake, was pronounced first chief and given a red-laced coat,
                  military cocked hat, and American flag. The Indians retreated to the shade of some
                  cottonwoods and divided the presents.</p>
               <p> The Lewis and Clark expedition came to the northern plains as outsiders, but that
                  night the explorers became part of a prairie community. In the late afternoon they
                  provided beads as prizes when Yankton boys showed their skill with bow and arrow.
                  At dark a crackling fire was built in the center of camp. Into the firelight came
                  men in gaudy paint to dance and sing of their great feats in battle and the chase.
                  Music came from a drum whose deerskin head was a gift from Lewis. While drummers
                  beat out a powerful rhythm, other Indians kept time with deer hoof rattles. Later,
                  Ordway recalled the vivid sights and sounds of that Calumet Bluff spectacle. "It
                  always began with a houp and hollow and ended with the same, and in the intervales
                  one of the warriors at a time would rise with his weapon and speak of what he had
                  done in his day and what warlike actions he had done. This they call merit. They
                  would confess how many horses they had Stole." Perhaps instructed by Dorion and
                  his son, members of the expedition threw the dancers gifts of tobacco, knives, and
                  hawks bells. For the Corps of Discovery, this would be a night to remember when
                  times were harder and there was less to celebrate.<ref target="n0150" n="50"/>

               <p> Lewis and Clark were beginning to learn that the protocol of Indian diplomacy
                  required time for chiefs and elders to hammer out replies to any proposal. But
                  Weuche and his fellow Yanktons had no desire to keep the Americans waiting. Very
                  early on the morning of August 31, the Indian delegation returned with their
                  answers. That there were several responses and not one common reply from the
                  Yanktons was another part of Lewis and Clark's education in native political
                  realities. Weuche wasted no time revealing what was uppermost in his mind.
                  Reliable trade connections were essential for the survival of the Yanktons. The
                  chief reported that he and his warriors lacked both firearms and ammunition. Their
                  women and children were destitute. Weuche wanted immediate relief, a request he
                  thought not unreasonable in view of the riches of the keelboat. As an alternative,
                  the chief suggested that his warriors be permitted to stop the next trade boat
                  from St. Louis and help themselves to whatever was necessary.</p>
               <p> But economics was not the only item on Weuche's agenda. As an astute plains
                  politician, he quickly recognized that close ties to the new father would both
                  protect and enhance the Yanktons' influence. Weuche cleverly offered his services
                  to organize a large delegation from many bands the following spring. While not
                  denying that men like Pierre Dorion and his son would be useful in that effort,
                  the chief made it clear that ultimate success hinged on his good offices. And as
                  for intertribal peace, Weuche again suggested that affairs be left in his hands.
                  Explaining that other Indians "would hear him better," the chief assured Lewis and
                  Clark that he could be trusted as a faithful intermediary. Finally, Weuche brought
                  his comments full circle by returning to the trade issue. This time the chief took
                  careful note of the international nature of the plains economy. Weuche reported
                  that he had already held English and Spanish medals. But, he pointedly complained,
                  the Yanktons needed more than bits of bronze and silver to fend off poverty. At
                  this point, Lewis and Clark may well have become worried by constant references to
                  trade goods. They had already chastised one Oto for paying undue attention to
                  knives and beads. If the friendly Yanktons thought the expedition was really a
                  trading venture, then less hospitable Indians farther upriver might stop and
                  plunder the Americans. At the end of Weuche's talk and before the other chiefs
                  began to speak, Lewis again attempted to explain the nature of their mission. He
                  insisted that the explorers were not traders but had come only to open the road
                  for others. He assured the Yanktons that honest traders with quality goods were
                  not far behind. But the concept of exploration as a national undertaking had no
                  precedent in tribal life. A keelboat filled with what seemed an endless store of
                  goods only served to confuse the question.</p>
               <p> Although the nature and purpose of the expedition was no clearer in Yankton
                  minds, other chiefs like White Crane and Half Man needed to be heard. Their
                  replies generally followed a common pattern. All agreed that trade and peace were
                  worthy objectives. Of all the Yanktons who spoke during the day, none offered more
                  important advice than Half Man. The chief made the expected promises, declaring
                  his interest in peace with the Otos and a desire to see the great Washington
                  chief. But at the end of his remarks, Half Man added a prophetic warning. "I
                  fear," he said, "those nations above will not open their ears, and you cannot I
                  fear open them."<ref target="n0151" n="51"/>
               </p>
               <p> Half Man's dark words were hard to take seriously in an atmosphere of friendship
                  and productive negotiation. The day ended with yet another show of airgun
                  firepower and keelboat curiosities. Gifts of corn and tobacco to the Yanktons
                  seemed to seal agreements while Dorion's plans to remain with them augured well
                  for the organization of delegations. On the surface, at least, the council was a
                  grand success. Here were <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> headmen and warriors who welcomed the Americans and gladly joined
                  the new trade system. The expedition's diplomacy appeared to have come of age. To
                  that achievement was added the collection of important ethnographic
                     information.<ref target="n0152" n="52"/> Just as significant, the expedition
                  had enjoyed good relations with a powerful people. Worries about "the nations
                  above" were easily discounted in the glow of proceedings at Calumet Bluff. Lewis
                  and Clark were so confident of continued success in dealing with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> that they did not think twice about leaving behind the only
                  skilled interpreter. That the expedition's fortunes were about to slide into a
                  morass of angry words and hostile gestures seemed remote. For now there were new
                  plains sights to capture the explorers' attention. Again finding the Missouri
                  channel, Lewis and Clark moved deeper into an Indian world that would both baffle
                  and challenge the Corps of Discovery. </p>

               <p> On August 30, 1806, as the homeward-bound Lewis and Clark expedition swept down
                  the Missouri near present-day Yankton, South Dakota, the explorers caught sight of
                  more than one hundred well-armed Indians lining the northeast river bank. Salutes
                  of greeting were fired by both parties as the expedition pulled up its canoes on
                  the southwest bank. But the initial welcome vanished when Clark discovered that
                  the Indians were Brulé <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> of Black Buffalo's band.<ref target="n0201" n="1"/> The captain
                  had hoped the Indians were Poncas, Omahas, or perhaps Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. But once their Brulé identity was known, he turned on them
                  with his own brand of invective.</p>
               <p> Taking instructions from Clark, the interpreter René Jusseaume shouted
                  across the river that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were "bad people" and that "if any [came] near our camp we should
                  kill them certainly." In a second barrage, Clark had Jusseaume tell the
                  Brulés that future traders would be "sufficiently strong to whip any vilenous
                  party who dare[d] to oppose them." As a parting shot, Clark notified the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> that the Americans had given guns, ammunition, and even a cannon
                  to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas—weapons that would surely be
                  turned against Brulé raiders. While most of the Indians retreated in the face
                  of Clark's bombast, several warriors remained on a hill, hooting, jeering, and
                  proclaiming their readiness to kill the Americans.</p>
               <p> Toward sunset, one man, probably Chief Black Buffalo, came to the water's edge
                  and invited the expedition to come across. Untongarabar, or Black Bull Buffalo, is
                  known in more recent literature as Black Bull. Lewis and Clark consistently called
                  him Black Buffalo. He remained a powerful force in Brulé politics and
                  Missouri River trade until his death in July 1813. When Clark ignored his request,
                  the Indian returned to the top of the hill and angrily struck the ground three
                  times with his gun. "This I am informed," wrote Clark drily, "is a great oath
                  among the Indians."<ref target="n0202" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p> The expedition's members did not sleep well that night. Wet sand, gusty winds,
                  and an exposed campsite made them uncomfortable. Perhaps the unsettling jeers and
                  curses of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> moved the captains and their men to recall another and
                  even more disagreeable clash just two years earlier with Black Buffalo and other
                  Brulé chiefs. A close look at that tense 1804 encounter can reveal much about
                  Lewis and Clark's relations with the Indians as well as the larger history of
                  Upper Missouri Indian-white contact.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> On the evening of September 23, 1804, as the men of the Lewis and Clark
                  expedition rested at their camp just below the mouth of the Bad River, three <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> boys swam across the Missouri to greet the explorers. The boys
                  came from Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> villages along the Bad River, opposite present-day Pierre, South
                  Dakota. From the very beginning of their enterprise, the captains had known they
                  would have to face the feisty Tetons. Their reputation for harrassing traders,
                  pilfering merchandise, and demanding large gifts was well known among St. Louis
                  merchants. Jean Baptiste Truteau, whose party had been stopped by the Tetons in
                  1794, warned that "all voyageurs who undertake to gain access to the nations of
                  the Upper Missouri ought to avoid meeting this tribe, as much for the safety of
                  their goods as for their lives even." Lewis and Clark's conversations in St. Louis
                  with Manuel Lisa, Antoine Soulard, the Chouteaus, and especially James Mackay, had
                  made them aware of the risks in meeting the Tetons. The expedition's chance
                  encounter with Regis Loisel, a trader just back from the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> country, had added to their information.<ref target="n0203" n="3"/> Now the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> boys told of two villages upriver. The captains,
                  anxious to begin the talks, told the boys that their chiefs were invited to a
                  conference the following day.<ref target="n0204" n="4"/>
               </p>
               <p> After breaking camp on Monday morning, September 24, the expeditions began
                  serious preparations for the long-anticipated parley. Knowing that the Brulé
                  chiefs would require substantial gifts for themselves and their people, the
                  captains worked through their bales of trade goods to find suitable presents.
                  Among the items selected for the chiefs were flags, medals, and a red military
                  coat and cocked hat. Also prepared for general distribution were knives, small
                  metal and fabric goods, and a large amount of tobacco. Because their St. Louis
                  contacts had warned them about the often violent tactics used by the Tetons to
                  control river traffic, the expedition was armed with more than gifts. Clark
                  cryptically recorded that he and Lewis "prepared all things for action in case of
                  necessity."</p>
               <p> That "necessity" seemed to come closer in the afternoon when John Colter, who had
                  been on shore hunting, reported that one of their horses had been stolen by some
                  Teton warriors. No sooner had Colter made his report than five Indians appeared on
                  shore. The expedition's flotilla, now near the mouth of the Bad River, anchored in
                  the Missouri while the captains tried to talk with these <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Lewis and Clark felt certain that they were the horse thieves
                  and, employing an old ruse, told them the horse was intended for their chief. The
                  American accusations and the fact that neither group understood the other made the
                  meeting confusing and potentially dangerous. After the Indians left, the
                  expedition made its way to an anchorage opposite the mouth of the Bad River. An
                  island in the Bad was selected as the place for negotiations the following
                  day.</p>
               <p> Later Monday evening, after the event of the stolen horse seemed less confusing
                  and threatening, Lewis went to the island for a preliminary smoke with the
                  Brulé chiefs. They promised to return the missing horse and proclaimed their
                  readiness for serious talk the next day. Once back on the keelboat, Lewis seemed
                  relieved to report "all well" with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>.<ref target="n0205" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p> Monday night was a time for Lewis and Clark to consider the intricate diplomacy
                  of the coming days. Jefferson's general instructions emphasized intertribal peace,
                  trade contacts, American sovereignty, and the collection of ethnological material.
                  But he had a special interest in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Of all the Indians east of the mountains known to whites, it was
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> that the president singled out for the explorers'
                  particular attention. Jefferson's concern with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> was based on his appraisal of both their military strength and
                  their economic potential. The martial power of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> nation on both sides of the Missouri was well known. Jefferson
                  was equally sensitive to the economic possibilities and imperial rivalries present
                  in any <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-American negotiations. The journal by Truteau that
                  Jefferson sent to Lewis in November 1803 revealed those elements. Truteau
                  described the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> as "the greatest beaver hunters," whose pelts were
                  worth "double the Canadian for the fineness of [their] fur and parchment."<ref target="n0206" n="6"/> Here was a grand opportunity for American enterprise.
                  Profits from the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> fur trade would be an early vindication of the Louisiana
                  Purchase. But, as Truteau had observed, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> trade was firmly in the hands of the North West Company and its
                  posts on the Des Moines and St. Peters rivers. If American sovereignty and
                  commerce were to triumph, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> would have to abandon John Bull for dealings with Uncle Sam.</p>
               <p> Jefferson hoped Lewis and Clark might begin to lure the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> into the American orbit. But that would be no easy task. As he
                  admitted to Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith, the United States was "miserably
                  weak" in its newly gained western lands. In an important letter to Lewis,
                  Jefferson urged the explorers to pay close attention to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. "On that nation," wrote the president, "we wish more
                  particularly to make a friendly impression, because of their immense power, and
                  because we learn they are very desirous of being on the most friendly terms with
                     us."<ref target="n0207" n="7"/> Jefferson engaged in wishful thinking when he
                  wrote that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were looking for American friendship, but he was closer to the
                  mark in noting "their immense power." Lewis and Clark would have to confront that
                  power, convince the Indians that St. Louis merchants did not endanger the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> role in Upper Missouri trade, and persuade Teton trappers and
                  hunters to bring their pelts and skins to American posts. The captains would have
                  to deal with Indian leaders who clearly understood tribal needs and had both the
                  diplomatic skill and the military force to command attention. With its tangle of
                  economic, military, and imperial interests, the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> negotiation was perhaps the most demanding piece of Indian
                  diplomacy assigned to Lewis and Clark.</p>
               <p> If the captains spent Monday night discussing the diplomacy for the next day,
                  then surely men like Black Buffalo, the Partisan, and Buffalo Medicine did the
                  same. For the Brulé bands and their leaders, the political and economic
                  stakes were very high. In the intricate trade network of the Upper Missouri, the
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> played a dangerous and precarious game. Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> of the Brulé, Oglala, a Miniconjou bands traditionally
                  traveled each year to a trade fair known as the Dakota Rendezvous, held on the
                  James River in east-central South Dakota. There the Tetons met Sisseton and
                  Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> who had obtained manufactured goods from North West
                  Company posts on the Des Moines and St. Peters rivers. The Teton bands used those
                  goods and buffalo robes in their agricultural trade with the Arikara village
                  farmers. With Teton population growing, a secure food supply was essential. So
                  long as the Tetons could control the flow of European goods to the villagers, the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> position would be reasonably strong. But if the villagers gained
                  easy direct access to St. Louis traders, the role of the Tetons as brokers and
                  middle-men would be lost. These commercial considerations required the Tetons to,
                  at most, blockade the Missouri River or, at least, exact considerable tribute from
                  traders coming upriver. The well-armed Lewis and Clark expedition, representing
                  St. Louis interests and determined to make direct contact with the Arikara,
                  Mandan, and Hidatsa villages, was an intrusion that could not be ignored.<ref target="n0208" n="8"/>
               </p>
               <p> But there was more than economic position at stake for the Brulé leaders. As
                  Lewis and Clark would soon discover, they were about to enter the tangled web of
                  band factional politics. In Brulé politics the leading players were Black
                  Buffalo, Buffalo Medicine, and Tortohongar, known to the whites as the Partisan.
                  Black Buffalo, chief of the largest Brulé band, was described by Tabeau as a
                  man "of good character, although angry and fierce in his fits of passion." His
                  authority and prestige had been challenged long before the advent of Lewis and
                  Clark by the Partisan, chief of the second-ranked Brulé band. Tabeau, whose
                  trade goods had been ransacked by the Partisan and some of his men, described this
                  Teton as "a true Proteus, who is seen in the selfsame day faint-hearted and bold,
                  audacious and fearful, proud and servile, conciliator and firebrand."<ref target="n0209" n="9"/> The role of Buffalo Medicine remains unclear; he was
                  called by Lewis and Clark the "3rd chief" in the power struggle between Black
                  Buffalo and the Partisan. That struggle for leadership often had unforeseen
                  consequences. When Black Buffalo engineered a temporary peace with his Ponca and
                  Omaha neighbors in 1803, the Partisan undercut the effort by organizing a
                  horse-stealing raid on the Poncas. In retaliation, Ponca warriors stole nine <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> horses and attacked a Brulé village. But the village they
                  raided was Black Buffalo's and the peace was broken.<ref target="n0210" n="10"/>
                  Now, as the negotiations with Lewis and Clark were about to begin, both Black
                  Buffalo and the Partisan looked to use the talks to increase their own prestige.
                  Playing to the Indian galleries, each chief would try to outdo the other in
                  zealous defense of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> privilege.</p>
               <p> Early on the morning of September 25, the expedition established a council place
                  on a sandbar in the Bad River. A canvas awning was put in place and a flagstaff
                  raised. By ten o'clock a large number of Indians began to gather along both river
                  banks. About eleven o'clock Black Buffalo, the Partisan, and Buffalo Medicine
                  appeared. Hoping to begin the conference on a generous note, the captains offered
                  the chiefs and thirty Brulé warriors something to eat. Not to be outdone, the
                  chiefs gave the expedition several hundred pounds of fat buffalo meat. Clark
                  responded by offering the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> some pork. Both sides had now shown the required hospitality and
                  it was time at last to talk. To their chagrin, the Americans discovered they
                  lacked an interpreter skillful enough for this demanding task. The translator
                  Pierre Dorion had remained with the Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> to promote peace between that tribe and the Omahas. Clark
                  unhappily noted, "We feel much at a loss for want of an interpreter." The
                  diplomats would have to rely on "the old frenchman" Pierre Cruzatte, who Clark
                  admitted, could "speak but little."<ref target="n0211" n="11"/>
               </p>
               <p> At noon both sides seemed ready to settle in for the speechmaking. After the
                  usual mandatory smoking, Lewis stood to make a short speech made shorter for want
                  of an interpreter. No journalist recorded Lewis's words, but it is likely that at
                  this early stage the captain spoke in no more than generalities. The speech
                  probably followed the pattern established in earlier conferences with other tribes
                  in which the explorer-diplomats touched on issues of intertribal peace, trade and
                  American sovereignty.<ref target="n0212" n="12"/>
               </p>
               <p> When Lewis's speech ended, the expedition put on its "traveling medicine
                  show"—a demonstration of martial power and Western technology. This display,
                  with its aim to impress the Indians with American might, had been successfully
                  staged earlier for the Otos, Missouris, and Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>.<ref target="n0213" n="13"/> The performance began with a
                  military parade by uniformed troops marching under the colors of the republic. As
                  the parade ended, Lewis and Clark sought to keep the military splendor and
                  political significance of the moment alive by handing out gifts to the Brulé
                  chiefs. Recognizing Black Buffalo as the leading chief present, the captains gave
                  him a medal, a red military coat, and a cocked hat. In their rush to gain approval
                  from Black Buffalo, the Americans evidently slighted the Partisan. Lewis and Clark
                  may have been insensitive to the nuances of rank and precedence in Teton politics,
                  but by trying to make Black Buffalo a client chief they were simply following
                  long-established diplomatic practice. From the time of earliest contact, European
                  and later American government officials had always sought one Indian chief or
                  headman, thinking he could both speak for and command the entire tribe. But
                  neglecting the Partisan was a serious oversight, one that was sure to spark
                  trouble in the coming days.</p>
               <p> While the last presents were being distributed, the carefully orchestrated show
                  was interrupted. The Brulé chiefs began to complain that the gifts were
                  inadequate, as they had done to earlier traders. They demanded the expedition
                  either stop its upriver progress and remain with them or at least leave a
                  gift-laden pirogue behind as tribute.<ref target="n0214" n="14"/> While the
                  captains must have known that such demands would eventually be made, they seemed
                  unprepared that afternoon to deal with them directly. The niceties of diplomacy
                  and the presence of many armed Teton warriors called for other measures. Lewis and
                  Clark tried to divert Brulé attention by going on with the military hardware
                  display. Lewis went through his now-familiar airgun demonstration, charging and
                  firing it several times. Evidently unimpressed, Black Buffalo and the other chiefs
                  continued to press their demands. Again hoping to divert the insistent chiefs, the
                  captains offered to take them and some of their soldiers on the keelboat. Once on
                  board, the Indians were shown "such curiossities as was strange to them." One
                  Brulé warrior was given a government certificate proclaiming him "the friend
                  and ally of the said states" and urging all citizens to treat him "in the most
                  friendly manner."<ref target="n0215" n="15"/> Adding to the general milling about
                  on the keelboat was the decision to break out some trade whiskey. Each chief was
                  given one-fourth glass, "which [he] appeared to be very fond of." Clark observed
                  that the Indians "sucked the bottle after it was out. "Amid this confusion the
                  Partisan made his move both to frighten the Americans and to impress bankside
                  Indian spectators. Feigning drunkenness as a cover "for his racially intentions,"
                  the Partisan became "troublesome." Fearing a bloody melee, Lewis and Clark
                  struggled to get the chiefs back on shore. Those efforts were resisted, and it was
                  only "with great relectiance" that the chiefs and their men boarded the pirogue
                  for shore. Although the Partisan seemed intent on using the presence of the
                  expedition as a means to advance his own power, Clark returned to land "with a
                  view of reconsileing those men to us."</p>
               <p> When the pirogue landed, an already difficult situation became potentially
                  explosive. Three young Brulés, who may have belonged to the Partisan's
                  retinue, seized the pirogue's bow cable. At the same moment, another warrior
                  locked his arms around the pirogue's short mast. As the pirogue was being
                  temporarily hijacked, the Partisan moved directly against Clark. The chief spoke
                  roughly to Clark, staggered up against him, and told him that the expedition could
                  not advance. The Partisan's actions were designed to test Clark, to make him
                  weaken and back down as had previous white visitors. Given the presence of so many
                  women and children, the Partisan had no intention of starting a shooting spree.
                  Clark must have sensed the limits of the situation. His response to the jostling
                  and "insolent jestures" was equally firm. Clark drew his sword and at the same
                  time alerted Lewis and the keelboat crew for action. Lewis ordered the swivel guns
                  readied while expeditionary soldiers around Clark prepared their weapons for
                  firing. Then, as quickly as the Partisan had created the tension, Black Buffalo
                  eased it. Obviously fearing heavy casualities if fighting erupted, Black Buffalo
                  took the pirogue's cable and forcefully ordered the Brulé warriors away from
                  the boat.</p>
               <p> Surrounded by warriors with their bows strung and arrows out of quivers, the
                  American captain and the Brulé chief now faced each other. The pointed and
                  angry words they exchanged, passed through a very inadequate interpreter, reveal
                  much about expedition-Indian relations and Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> policy. Clark told Black Buffalo that the expedition "must and
                  would go on." To emphasize that determination, he told the Indians that his men
                  "were not squaws, but warriors." Rising to this rhetorical challenge, Black
                  Buffalo declared that "he had warriors too and if we were to go on they would
                  follow us and kill and take the whole of us by degrees." Angered by the threats,
                  Clark "felt My Self warm and Spoke in verry positive terms." Those terms included
                  a reminder that the expedition was sent by the Chief of the Seventeen Fires, whose
                  warriors could be summoned in a moment to punish the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. And in a burst of temper, Clark boasted that he had "more
                  medicine on board his boat than would kill twenty such nations in one day."<ref target="n0216" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p> The verbal sparring might have continued a bit longer except for the arrival of a
                  canoe filled with twelve American soldiers "ready for any event." Most of the
                  Indian warriors retreated and Clark was now left alone with the chiefs and a core
                  of Brulé soldiers. Black Buffalo, still holding the pirogue's cable, asked if
                  the women and children might see the keelboat and its curiosities. This was an
                  easy request to grant, one that might allow both sides to emerge with honor and
                  prestige intact. Clark agreed and Black Buffalo dropped the cable. Determined to
                  have the last word, the chief declared that "he was sorry to have us go for his
                  women and children were naked and poor and wished to get some goods, but he did
                  not think we were merchants, nor that we were loaded with goods, but he was sorry
                  to have us leave so soon." As Clark and his men stood by the pirogue, the chiefs
                  walked down the bank for a private council. After waiting some time, Clark
                  approached the chiefs and offered to shake hands. The captain was rebuffed and
                  took that as a signal that discussions were over for the day.</p>
               <p> As Clark and his party paddled back to the keelboat, Black Buffalo made one last
                  demand. He and two of his warriors waded out ten feet from shore and asked to be
                  taken on the keelboat. That night, as the Brulé chief and his men slept on a
                  board, Clark wrote simply of the day: "Their treatment to me was verry rough and I
                  think justified roughness on my part." Clark neglected to add that their diplomacy
                  was being drawn off course and onto the single point of continued upriver
                  progress. The roughness of the day was hardly what Jefferson had in mind by "a
                  friendly impression." The initiative was clearly in Brulé hands. All Lewis
                  and Clark could do was react and hope to escape unscathed. And as an indication of
                  the apprehensive mood felt throughout the expedition, the island named "Good
                  humored" was changed to "Bad humored island as we were in a bad humor."<ref target="n0217" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> The tensions of the previous day were not repeated on Wednesday, September 26.
                  With Black Buffalo and his soldiers still on board, the keelboat sailed about five
                  miles upriver. The shore was lined with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> spectators closely watching the progress of the chiefs and the
                  explorers. Clark noted that "these people Shew great anxiety." With the failure of
                  the bluff-and-bluster tactics the day before and the expedition now moving
                  upriver, perhaps many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> feared they had lost the battle of wits and wills. Hoping to keep
                  the expedition a bit longer, Black Buffalo asked the captains to land near his
                  village so his women and children might visit the boat. Lewis and Clark agreed,
                  perhaps feeling that more time with the Tetons might produce a change in the
                  diplomatic climate.<ref target="n0218" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p> Anchoring the keelboat about one hundred yards from shore, the captains divided
                  their forces. Lewis accompanied Black Buffalo to the Brulé village while
                  Clark remained on board. The Brulé chief "appeared disposed to make up and be
                  friendly." The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> village the expedition saw that day must have been an impressive
                  sight. Ordway, one of the expedition's most careful observers, wrote: "Their lodge
                  [village] is very handsome in a circle and about 100 cabbins in nomber and all
                  white, made of buffalo hides dressed white. One large one in the center, the lodge
                  for the war dances."<ref target="n0219" n="19"/> Ordway and Gass estimated that
                  with about ten persons in each tepee the total village population was eight or
                  nine hundred persons. Gass thought that two-thirds of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> in the village were women and children.<ref target="n0220" n="20"/>
               </p>
               <p> As the morning slipped away and no word came from Lewis, those on the keelboat
                  "became uneasy for fear of Deception." After about three hours, Clark sent Gass to
                  find Lewis. Gass reported back that Lewis was well and that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were preparing a feast and dance to honor the Americans. That
                  news was a clear indication of a shift in Brulé tactics. If the whites could
                  not be easily bluffed, they might be flattered and impressed by a show of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> hospitality and military prowess. It was Black Buffalo's turn to
                  demonstrate "medicine" as the Americans had done earlier. Throughout the afternoon
                  many Brulé folk made "frequent selicitiations" for the expedition to remain
                  one night longer so that they could "Show their good disposition towards us." Once
                  the captains agreed, they were carried with much ceremony on white buffalo robes
                  to the great council lodge.</p>
               <p> The scene that night in the Brulé village made a lasting impression on many
                  members of the expedition. Fires glowed through translucent tepees as women
                  prepared vast quantities of food for the feast. Slabs of buffalo meat roasted over
                  hot coals. In a circle inside the council lodge were seated some seventy elders
                  and prominent warriors. The Americans were placed next to Black Buffalo. Directly
                  in front of the chiefs a six-foot sacred circle had been cleared for holy pipes,
                  pipe stands, and medicine bundles. American and Spanish flags were also displayed
                  in the circle. Lewis and Clark noticed the Spanish ensign but decided to ignore
                  it. There is no evidence to suggest that the Tetons recognized the sovereignty of
                  either Spain or the United States. The flag may have been used simply for colorful
                  decoration.</p>
               <p> The diplomacy of the evening began when a Brulé elder stood "and Spoke
                  aproveing what we had done." Because the captains still lacked a reliable <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> interpreter, they were uncertain about much of what the old man
                  said. The import of his speech seemed to be that the Brulé bands were poor
                  and that the expedition should trade with them, not the upriver tribes. No
                  journalist recorded the American reply, but the explorers probably repeated their
                  usual formula about peace with other tribes and the need for the expedition to
                  press on. The concern for intertribal peace was a cornerstone in Jefferson's
                  Indian policy and also reflected the needs of the St. Louis merchants. Because
                  Lewis and Clark had learned earlier in the day that there were many Omaha
                  prisoners in the Brulé villages, the Americans saw this as an opportunity to
                  promote Teton-Omaha peace. Clark called upon Black Buffalo to free the Omaha
                  captives. Black Buffalo's attempt at peacemaking with the Omahas had been
                  disrupted by the Partisan in 1803, and there was little reason to think the chief
                  would release valuable prisoners just to gratify what must have seemed the whim of
                  a distant chief.</p>
               <p> The council reached its dramatic climax when Black Buffalo "rose with great
                  state" to address the gathering. Again hindered by the lack of a skilled
                  interpreter, Lewis and Clark understood little of what the chief said. Clark
                  recorded in his journal that the chief spoke "to the same purpose" as did the
                  Brulé elder. It seems clear that Black Buffalo was employing his oratorical
                  talents to further the fundamental Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> aim—to keep the expedition from opening direct trade with
                  the Arikaras and other Upper Missouri village people. His speech finished, Black
                  Buffalo took up the most holy of the pipes and pointed it in each of the cardinal
                  directions. Before lighting the pipe, he offered a prayer. Still holding the pipe,
                  the chief took some tender dog meat and made a "Sacrefise to the flag." These
                  solemnities over, the pipe was passed around the circle for all to smoke.</p>
               <p> Food was next on the evening agenda. The captains and their men were presented
                  with all the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> delicacies, including platters of roast dog, buffalo,
                  pemmican, and prairie turnips.<ref target="n0221" n="21"/> The whole assembly ate
                  and smoked with an air of conviviality until dusk. At nightfall a large fire was
                  made in the center of the village to light the way for musicians and dancers. Ten
                  male musicians entered first. Their instruments were of two kinds: a
                  tambourine-like instrument made by stretching a skin over a willow hoop, and
                  various rattles made by tying deer and antelope hooves on a long stick. Clark
                  noted that the rattles made a "gingling noise." As the men began to sing and play,
                  women "highly Deckerated in their way" came forward and began to dance in time to
                  the rhythm. In this war dance the women displayed scalps and other war trophies
                  belonging to their male relatives. That night such a display was surely aimed at
                  impressing Lewis and Clark with Brulé military might. One young man moved
                  away from the players and toward the spectators. In a high singing voice he
                  recounted the daring exploits of band members in combat with their enemies. His
                  words were picked up by the performers behind him and repeated to add power to the
                  whole spectacle.<ref target="n0222" n="22"/> Throughout the evening members of the
                  expedition rewarded the singers and dancers with tobacco. When one warrior thought
                  he had not received his proper due, he broke one drum, threw two more in the fire,
                  and angrily left the dance line. The two drums were hastily retrieved from the
                  fire and the dancing continued.<ref target="n0223" n="23"/> The entertainment,
                  "done with great Chearfullness," went on until midnight. Ordway found the music
                  "delightful," but by midnight Lewis and Clark were plainly weary. Tactfully, they
                  suggested to the chiefs that everyone must now be tired. Taking the hint, the
                  chiefs ended the festivities and returned with the captains to spend the night on
                  the keelboat.<ref target="n0224" n="24"/>
               </p>
               <p> As Lewis and Clark left the Brulé village, they were offered young women as
                  bed partners. For the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, the proposal combined hospitality and diplomacy. Clark
                  understood the meaning of the offer, writing later that "a curious custom with the
                  Souix as well as the rickeres [Arikaras] is to give handsom squars to those whome
                  they wish to Show some acknowledgments to." Repeating the offer the following
                  night, the Indians made clear to Clark that the woman stood for the whole band. He
                  was urged "to take her and not dispise them." Although fully aware of the symbolic
                  significance of sexual intercourse with the proffered woman, Clark dismissed her.
                  That rejection must have bewildered the Brulés and surely did not foster the
                  friendship and trust Jefferson was seeking.<ref target="n0225" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> The late night entertainment was unquestionably a great emotional release from
                  the tensions of earlier days, but Clark reported that at least he did not sleep
                  well. On Thursday morning, September 27, both the captains and the chiefs were up
                  early. Black Buffalo and the Partisan were given, or rather they simply
                  appropriated, the blankets they had slept on. After breakfast Lewis and the chiefs
                  went on shore "as a verry large part of their nation was comeing in" to see the
                  expedition. Clark remained on the keelboat, where he wrote a letter to Pierre
                  Dorion and prepared a medal and some certificates for Lewis to use later in the
                  day.</p>
               <p> About midafternoon Lewis, accompanied by Black Buffalo, the Partisan, and the
                  "considerable man" Warchapa, returned to the keelboat. After about half an hour,
                  the captains evidently thought it best that all return to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> village. When Clark began to suggest they go ashore, the chiefs
                  showed "great reluctiance" to leave. That reluctance finally overcome, Clark first
                  visited the Partisan's lodge. A crowd gathered outside the tepee as the American
                  and the Brulé spoke "on various subjects." Continuing his round of courtesy
                  calls, Clark stopped at the lodge of a Brulé elder and then moved on to Black
                  Buffalo's tepee. From there Clark was conducted to a gathering of Teton elders.
                  Toward evening Lewis arrived in the village and both captains enjoyed a display of
                  the same dancing and ceremony as the previous night. And once again, on the way
                  back to the keelboat, they were offered <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> women. As before, the offer was rejected.</p>
               <p> Tired by a full day of talking and visiting, the American party, along with the
                  Partisan and one of his soldiers, made their way on the white pirogue back to the
                  keelboat. The evening stillness was shattered when some clumsy steering caused the
                  pirogue to slam broadside against the keelboat's anchor cable. The cable broke and
                  both vessels began to swing dangerously. Clark at once shouted at his men to get
                  their oars in order to prevent further damage to either vessel. His shouting and
                  the general bustle of men moving quickly in the darkness frightened the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. An alarm ran through the village as Black Buffalo spread the
                  word that an Omaha attack was at hand. Within ten minutes the chief and two
                  hundred armed men prepared for combat were on the river bank. After about half an
                  hour, most of the warriors made their way back to the village. However, some sixty
                  remained on watch throughout the night.</p>
               <p> Both Lewis and Clark believed that the sudden appearance of so many warriors was
                  a "signal of their intentions (which was to Stop our proceeding on our journey and
                  if Possible rob us.)"<ref target="n0226" n="26"/> This harsh view of Brulé
                  motives was not shared by others in the expedition. Sergeants Ordway and Gass and
                  Private Whitehouse emphasized both the fear of Omaha attack and the genuine desire
                  of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> to help the endangered vessels.<ref target="n0227" n="27"/> In light of Brulé activities before Lewis and Clark's coming,
                  Black Buffalo's fear of Omaha attack was well grounded. In early September, some
                  two weeks before the expedition arrived, a Brulé war party had raided an
                  Omaha village, burning forty lodges and killing more than seventy-five of the
                  tribe. There were now some forty-eight Omaha prisoners in the two Brulé
                  villages along the Bad River.<ref target="n0228" n="28"/> In the cycle of raid and
                  reprisal, Black Buffalo had every reason to think the confusion in the night was
                  due to something more than a broken cable and a missing anchor.</p>
               <p> But the Americans also had reason to worry that night. Although Clark stressed
                  the sudden arrival of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors as cause for alarm, it was probably intelligence brought
                  to the captains by Pierre Cruzatte that put the expedition on its guard throughout
                  the night. On Wednesday, September 26, Cruzatte had been given some trade goods as
                  presents for the Omaha prisoners. Now, in return, the prisoners told the
                  interpreter that Lewis and Clark "were to be stoped." The value of that
                  information gathered from Indians who saw the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> as enemies is now hard to judge. Certainly it fit the overall
                  evaluation of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> behavior held by the expedition. Clark's tense lines
                  "we Shew as little signs of a Knowledge of their intentions as possible, all
                  prepared on board for any thing which might happen, we kept a Strong guard all
                  night in the boat, no Sleep" betray both fear of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> military power and an exaggerated readiness to fight.<ref target="n0229" n="29"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark and their men had now been with the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> for three days. Those were days filled with isolated moments of
                  trouble and misunderstanding and long periods of friendly visiting and good
                  company. The expedition gathered some important ethnographic data, tried to make
                  its point about American sovereignty, and even practiced, albeit with dubious
                  success, some intertribal peace-making. But on the crucial issue of
                  trade—safe passage up the Missouri for fur traders and St. Louis
                  merchants—there had been little or no progress. The expedition planned to
                  spend the rest of the year at the Mandan villages; with winter coming, it was now
                  time to move on. That determination to press upriver collided with the equal
                  determination of the Brulé chiefs both to advance their own prestige and to
                  defend Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> economic interests. In the eyes of men like Black
                  Buffalo and the Partisan, the continued presence of the American expedition posed
                  something of a dilemma and an embarrassment. Both men needed to act forcefully to
                  vindicate personal claims to power. Teton bands had come to expect their headmen
                  to obtain gifts from river traders. A chief who could not deliver was bound to
                  have his authority openly questioned. At the same time, faced with a well-armed
                  party under strong leadership, the chiefs feared pressing their demands too far.
                  If there was a bloody incident and Indian casualties were high, the chiefs would
                  surely lose influence. Pressure tactics that proved effective in intimidating
                  poorly armed traders who needed <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> cooperation would not work against a military expedition whose
                  goals went far beyond the ledger book. It was against this background of cross
                  purposes, face saving, and Lewis and Clark's determination to leave the Bad River
                  that the last day of the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> confrontation was played out.</p>
               <p> Much of Friday morning was spent in a fruitless search for the keelboat anchor.
                  By midmorning, when the work parties took breakfast, nearly all the Brulés
                  lined the river bank. As the captains were about to order the sail hoisted, Black
                  Buffalo and the other chiefs appeared. Once on board, the Brulé leaders began
                  their now-familiar demand that the expedition remain with them. Ordway noted that
                  the warriors on the bank were well armed with guns, spears, "a kind of cutlashes,"
                  and bows with metal-tipped arrows.<ref target="n0230" n="30"/> Anxious to leave,
                  the crew made preparations to cast off the bowline. At that moment several of the
                  Partisan's warriors took hold of the cable. Clark, who was inside the cabin with
                  Black Buffalo, saw what happened and complained to the chief. Evidently fearing
                  that the seizure of the cable spelled the beginning of very serious trouble, and
                  perhaps resenting the role of the Partisan in the affair, the Brulé chief
                  hurried forward to assure Lewis that the warriors simply wanted tobacco. Lewis,
                  weary of the constant demands for gifts, refused to give them anything. He ordered
                  all hands ready for departure, had the sail hoisted, and detailed one man to untie
                  the bow cable.</p>
               <p> At this critical moment several things happened at once. The bow cable, first
                  untied by a crewman, was again fastened by several of the Partisan's warriors. At
                  the same time, the Partisan himself demanded a flag and some tobacco. Lewis
                  angrily ordered all Indians off the boat while Clark threw a carrot of tobacco on
                  the bank. Clark then took the firing taper for the port swivel gun in his hand and
                  "spoke so as to touch his [Black Buffalo's] pride." Clark did not record the
                  sarcasm in his journal but years later told Nicholas Biddle, "I threw him tobacco
                  saying to the chief you have told us you are a great man—have
                  influence—take this tobacco and shew us your influence by taking the rope
                  from your men and letting go without coming to hostilities."<ref target="n0231" n="31"/> Clark also had a "rangleing" exchange with the Partisan. Violence
                  seemed seconds away. Warriors hurried women and children from the bank. But it was
                  Black Buffalo who finally calmed the situation. He promised the expedition safe
                  conduct if tobacco, always a ceremonial tribute, was given to the warriors holding
                  the cable. Lewis and Clark balked at the demand, saying that they "did not mean to
                  be trifled with." Seeing the captains hesitate, Black Buffalo sarcastically
                  observed that "he was mad too, to see us stand so much for one carrot of tobacco."
                  Lewis tossed the tobacco to the Indians and Black Buffalo jerked the cable from
                  their hands. At that moment the Teton confrontation was over.<ref target="n0232" n="32"/>
               </p>
               <p> In those moments when Clark was ready to fire, when the Brulé warriors had
                  bows strung, and when the Partisan was shouting defiance, it was Black Buffalo who
                  showed both firmness and the ability to compromise. Perhaps by September 28 the
                  Brulé chief realized that nothing further could be gained by delaying Lewis
                  and Clark. There would be other parties from St. Louis, less well armed, with more
                  goods, and easier to intimidate. Allowing one boat to pass was hardly a defeat.
                  Black Buffalo had obtained ceremonial tribute from the Americans and had lost
                  nothing in the eyes of his own people. But at the beginning of the final day of
                  the confrontation, the political ambitions of the Partisan were as yet
                  unfulfilled. His contest for influence with Black Buffalo still gave him reason to
                  harrass the Americans. The Partisan, described by Buffalo Medicine's son as a
                  "Double Spoken man," seized the initiative that day as one more means to gain
                  precedence over Black Buffalo.<ref target="n0233" n="33"/> The last minutes of the
                  Teton encounter were less a conflict between Indians and American explorers and
                  more a tussle between rival band headmen. In the end it was Black Buffalo who
                  engineered a compromise allowing each party to escape with some dignity intact and
                  without bloodshed.</p>
               <p> If Black Buffalo is credited with working to avoid violence, then Lewis and Clark
                  also deserve a share of the glory. They took seriously their instructions from

                  their own conduct will admit."<ref target="n0234" n="34"/> The captains also
                  understood the flexibility they had as explorers. They could, with enough
                  determination and good fortune, move up the Missouri. Unlike the St. Louis
                  traders, Lewis and Clark did not have to stay with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, trade with them, and depend on their cooperation. Subsequent St.
                  Louis parties, from Nathaniel Pryor's Sheheke expedition to Wilson Price Hunt's
                  Astorians, would find the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> as intransigent as ever.</p>
               <p> The memory of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> September was still fresh when Clark, writing from Fort Mandan
                  during the winter of 1804–1805, described the Tetons as "the vilest
                  miscreants of the savage race, and must ever remain the pirates of the
                     Missouri."<ref target="n0235" n="35"/> Clark's harsh words masked a harsher
                  reality. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> talks had failed. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were no closer to becoming part of the St. Louis trade network.
                  No delegation of Brulé dignitaries was prepared to visit the president.
                  Jefferson's call for Lewis and Clark to make a "friendly impression" on Black
                  Buffalo's folk was lost in a welter of conflicting band and personal quarrels.
                  Lewis admitted as much when he informed Jefferson that Corporal Richard
                  Warfington's return party bound for St. Louis, the spring of 1805 was sure to
                  encounter heavy <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> fire. <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> hostility might endanger not only Warfington's men but the
                  keelboat loaded with the expedition's journals, maps, and botanical specimens. The
                  hazard was real enough that Warfington's men "pledged themselves to us that they
                  will not yeald while there is a man of them living."<ref target="n0236" n="36"/>
                  This was hardly the sort of diplomatic conclusion Jefferson sought. At best Lewis
                  and Clark could say their efforts were inconclusive; at worst they may have
                  exacerbated <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-American relations.</p>
               <p> Nearly 150 years later, Bernard DeVoto voiced what has become historical wisdom
                  about the encounter. DeVoto declared that Lewis and Clark defeated the Tetons,
                  forced them to back down, and made them "women" in the eyes of their neighbors.
                  Heaping abuse on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, he described Brulé soldiers as "bully boys" engaged in
                  "storm trooper tactics." DeVoto maintained that after being defeated by the
                  no-nonsense firmness of the Americans, the Tetons "were just beggars again."<ref target="n0237" n="37"/> But it was not the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> who were defeated. Rather, it was American diplomacy that had
                  been handed a stinging rebuff. As Lewis and Clark recognized in their 1806 letter
                  to the North West Company trader Hugh Heney, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> would always be a barrier to trade on the Upper Missouri "until
                  some effectual measures be taken to render them pacific."<ref target="n0238" n="38"/> They had surely not been rendered "pacific" by three days of playing
                  cat and mouse with Lewis and Clark. In the next two decades, as English traders
                  retreated from the prairies and plains and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> population grew, the Teton bands did indeed turn to American
                  merchants. But until that happened, Jefferson's assessment that the United States
                  was "miserably weak" proved a painfully accurate appraisal of northern plains
                  realities. Lewis and Clark had done little to transform those political and
                  economic realities. </p>

               <p> The Teton encounter had no quick ending and escaping its tangles proved no easy
                  task. When the expedition resumed its progress up the Missouri River on September
                  29, Black Buffalo was on board the keelboat while the Partisan was waiting in the
                  wings. Standing on a sandbar, the Partisan and two of his warriors demanded
                  transportation as far as the Arikara villages. When the captains refused, Black
                  Buffalo suggested that a carrot or two of tobacco and a ferry ride from one bank
                  to the other might placate the Partisan. Lewis and Clark wearily complied, hoping
                  this would be the last Teton request.</p>
               <p> The expedition's attention was now turned to the first signs of the Arikaras. At
                  the mouth of No Timber Creek, known today as Chantier Creek, the Americans found
                  an abandoned Arikara settlement. Described by Truteau in the mid-1790s the village
                  had been occupied until the end of the century. Clark wrote that nothing remained
                  of the village "but the mound which surrounds the town." Ordway, who always had an
                  eye for simple but revealing detail, noted remains of cornfields in rich
                  bottomland around the empty village.<ref target="n0301" n="1"/> In subsequent days
                  the expedition would see more abandoned towns, all mute testimony to the many
                  years of Arikara migration along the Missouri.</p>
               <p> On the following day, September 30, some of the last scenes in the Teton drama
                  were played out. With Black Buffalo still on board, the explorers brought their
                  flotilla to a sandbar opposite a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> encampment. As the men ate breakfast, the captains talked with
                  several warriors. The Indians were told about the "bad treatment" the expedition
                  had suffered at the hands of the Teton bands lower down the river and were warned
                  not to try the same. Those brave words were carefully matched by a generous amount
                  of tobacco, and the American party moved on without incident. In the afternoon the
                  wind picked up and the Missouri suddenly became a choppy lake. Rocking
                  dangerously, the keelboat seemed ready to founder. Black Buffalo, fearing for his
                  life, pleaded to be put ashore. Perhaps relieved to be free of their Indian
                  passenger, the captains gave the chief some gifts and "advised him to keep his men
                     away."<ref target="n0302" n="1"/>
               </p>
               <p> In early October, as the weather turned cold and windy, the expedition
                  encountered even more traces of the Arikaras. On the first of the month, they
                  found another abandoned townsite, a fortified island settlement of substantial
                  size. Clark described the ruins as "only a mound circular walls 3 or 4 feet
                     high."<ref target="n0303" n="3"/> But Lewis and Clark found more than Arikara
                  remains around the Cheyenne River; they also found Jean Vallé, an independent
                  trader. The Frenchman was engaged in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> trade and had a small supply of goods for that purpose.
                  Vallé gave the captains an important bit of information about Upper Missouri
                  trade patterns when he reported that many of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were currently at the Grand River Arikara villages.<ref target="n0304" n="4"/> Lewis and Clark would soon learn much more about that
                     Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> connection, and disrupting it became one of the
                  captains' leading diplomatic objectives.</p>
               <p> Knowing that they would soon be with the Arikaras did not allay the ever present
                  dread of Teton ambush. October 2 proved to be a day filled with alarms and fear of
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Suspecting a surprise attack, "We prepared our selves
                  for action which we expected every moment." Action seemed at hand early in the
                  afternoon when a large Teton band appeared on a hill overlooking the north bank of
                  the river. One of the warriors came down to the bank and fired his gun into the
                  air. Certain that the attack was upon them, the expedition prepared to defend
                  itself. Whitehouse later wrote, "we were determined to fight or dye." But that
                  firm resolve was unnecessary as the Teton party, whose intentions were never
                  clear, left as quickly as it had appeared.<ref target="n0305" n="5"/>
                  <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors would not again menace the explorers until they wintered
                  with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>.</p>
               <p> As the expedition continued up the Missouri, there were more signs of the
                  Arikaras. On October 4, the captains saw the island village of Lahoocatt, a
                  fortified town of some seventeen earth lodges. Lahoocatt had been occupied by an
                  Arikara tribe that Tabeau called the Laocatas. About 1797 they had abandoned
                  Lahoocatt and moved north to join the larger body of Arikaras at the Grand River
                     villages.<ref target="n0306" n="6"/> At the end of the first week of October,
                  Lewis and Clark saw even more abandoned villages around the mouth of the Moreau
                  River. Clark noted a substantial settlement of "about 80 neet lodges covered with
                  earth and picketed around." A brief examination of the site turned up bullboats,
                  mats, and baskets. Three different kinds of squash were still growing in the
                  untended village fields.<ref target="n0307" n="7"/> The following day, October 7,
                  Clark walked up the Moreau River bank about a mile to yet another vacant Arikara
                  town, this one consisting of some sixty lodges. Occupied as late as the previous
                  winter, the village was strewn with mats, baskets, and bullboats.<ref target="n0308" n="8"/>

            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Earth lodges, fortifications, and extensive fields of corn, beans, and squash
                  were all signs of the culture of the Missouri Valley villagers. The Arikaras, or
                  Star-rah-he as they called themselves, were the first of the northern plains
                  villagers encountered by the expedition.<ref target="n0309" n="9"/> Virtually all
                  European visitors to the Arikaras noted the linguistic affinity between the Platte
                  River <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref> and the Arikaras. Tabeau observed, "The Loups and all
                  the different Panis now on the River Platte, made, undoubtedly with the Ricaras
                  but one nation which time and circumstance have, without doubt insensibly
                  divided." Lewis and Clark agreed. The Arikaras, they wrote, "are the remains of
                  ten large tribes of Panias."<ref target="n0310" n="10"/> The Arikaras met by the
                  expedition were descendants of people who came out of what later anthropologists
                  called the Central Plains Tradition. These people built nearly square lodges with
                  rounded corners in what is now western Iowa, Kansas north of the Arkansas River
                  drainage, and east and south-central Nebraska. Since the tradition is associated
                  with the Caddoan language family, they were probably the predecessors of the
                  historic <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref> and Arikaras.</p>
               <p> Sometime after A.D. 1400 these proto-Arikaras began moving north out of the
                  central plains into the Big Bend region of the Upper Missouri. This migration may
                  have been occasioned by severe droughts on the central plains. As the
                  proto-Arikara entered the Upper Missouri, they settled in territory claimed by the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Early relations between the two peoples were
                  generally peaceful. Indeed, housing styles of the Central Plains Tradition
                  influenced Mandan earth lodge construction. But by the middle-1400s, as the
                  northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> began to reoccupy the Bad-Cheyenne region, conflict
                  erupted. One sign of conflict was the rise of fortified Arikara villages.<ref target="n0311" n="11"/> Meeting stiff resistance, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> gradually withdrew during the 1450–1650 period, leaving
                  the Upper Missouri south of the North Dakota border open for Arikara occupation.
                  After the mid-sixteenth century and until the historic era, Arikara sites in the
                  Big Bend and Bad-Cheyenne regions were unfortified, a fact suggesting that fear of
                  Mandan attack had considerably diminished. But that fairly peaceful interlude was
                  shattered in the eighteenth century when the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> migration to the northern plains and increased tension with the
                  Mandan and Hidatsa villagers once again caused Arikara villages to be protected
                  with enclosing ditches and palisades. As Lewis and Clark were to learn, the
                  Arikaras were entering a time of trouble—trouble not to be made any less by
                  the presence of outsiders with unpredictable behavior and uncertain motives.<ref target="n0312" n="12"/>
               </p>
               <p> Characteristic of the Missouri village life-style was the compact settlement with
                  dome-shaped earth lodges, gardens, and nearby fields. Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa
                  towns were all located around the mouths of major western tributaries of the
                  Missouri River. The Bad, Cheyenne, Moreau, and Grand Rivers were the foci of
                  Arikara occupation in the historic period. Several related ecological factors
                  determined the location of Indian villages. The rivers provided fresh water while
                  the valleys offered a source of firewood. In addition, the east-west position of
                  the valleys acted as natural highways guiding western tribes such as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, and Kiowas to the agricultural towns.<ref target="n0313" n="13"/>
               </p>
               <p> By the time Lewis and Clark reached the Arikaras in 1804, the villages were again
                  fortified with ditches and palisades. The first extensive description of Arikara
                  defenses of the kind seen by the captains comes from Truteau's 1795 journal. He
                  noted that Arikara villages were ringed by palisdes five feet high and reinforced
                  with earth. The palisades were made of stout willow or cottonwood poles "as thick
                  as one's leg, resting on the crosspieces and very close together." Against the
                  palisades was an earth embankment at least two feet thick. "In this way," he
                  wrote, "the height of the poles would prevent the scaling of the fort by the
                  enemy, while the well-packed earth protects those within from their balls and
                     arrows."<ref target="n0314" n="14"/>
               </p>
               <p> Before the outbreak of smallpox in the 1780s, there were numerous Arikara
                  villages, each containing upwards of thirty-five earth lodges. By the advent of
                  Lewis and Clark, Arikara settlements clustered around the Cheyenne, Moreau, and
                  Grand rivers had grown to accommodate refugees from war and disease. The captains
                  noticed recently abandoned towns of sixty loges; each of three villages visited
                  during their interlude with the Arikaras had at least that number. The lodges were
                  scattered in no apparent pattern, a deviation from the arrangement of them in
                  rough lanes that recent anthropologists have identified as part of the Middle
                  Missouri Tradition. When Henry Brackenridge visited the Arikara towns in 1811, he
                  found the lodges built so close to each other that it was easy for a newcomer to
                  become lost quickly. There was no central plaza, as in Mandan towns, although the

               <p> Arikara earth lodges were the first of that distinctive housing described by the
                  expedition. The circular design of the domestic earth lodge can be traced back to
                  what is known as the Central Plains Tradition. The essential features of the
                  historic earth lodge included a fire pit at the center of the floor, four primary
                  posts to hold up the superstructure, a smoke hole in the roof, and a tunnel-like
                  entrance. The average Arikara lodge was about fifteen feet high and thirty feet in
                  diameter. Replacing dirt washed away from the frame was an important task for
                  women after every rain.<ref target="n0316" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although many European visitors to the Arikara towns attempted to describe the
                  construction of earth lodges, few could bring the practiced eye of a carpenter to
                  the subject as did Patrick Gass.<ref target="n0317" n="17"/> On October 10, 1804,
                  Gass and several other members of the expedition went to the Arikara village at
                  Ashley Island. While there, the sergeant took time to study earth lodges and their
                  construction. Gass's description remains the best firsthand account of Arikara
                  housing.</p>
               <p>
                  <quote> In a circle of a size suited to the dimensions of the intended lodge, they
                     set up 16 forked posts five or six feet high, and lay poles from one fork to
                     another. Against these poles they lean other poles, slanting from the ground,
                     and extending about four inches above the cross poles: these are to recieve the
                     ends of the upper poles, that support the roof. They next set up four large
                     forks, fifteen feet high, and about ten feet apart, in the middle of the area;
                     and poles or beams between these. The roof poles are then laid on extending
                     from the lower poles across the beams which rest on the middle forks, of such a
                     length as to leave a hole at the top for a chimney. The whole is then covered
                     with willow branches, except the chimney and hole below to pass through. On the
                     willow branches they lay grass and lastly clay. At the hole below they build a
                     pen about four feet wide and projecting ten feet from the hut; and hang a
                     buffalo skin at the entrance of the hut for a door.<ref target="n0318" n="18"/>

               <p> The earth lodge towns and their sedentary populations were possible because the
                  villagers developed a complex strategy to wrest a living from the Upper Missouri
                  valley. Outsiders who visited the region in the summer months did not experience
                  the demands placed on Indians for survival in the northern plains environment.
                  Those demands included a climate of extremes from winters of—44°F to
                  summer of +116°F and an average yearly rainfall of no more than sixteen
                  inches. This rigorous climate yielded a frost-free growing season of no more than
                  one hundred days a year.<ref target="n0319" n="19"/> Temperature, rainfall, and
                  seasonal flooding meant agricultural uncertainties for Upper Missouri farmers.
                  Despite these problems, Arikara farming was productive enough to sustain village
                  life and produce a substantial surplus for trade.</p>
               <p> Arikara agriculture centered on the production of several food crops and at least
                  one ceremonial plant. <hi rend="italic">Zea mays,</hi> the wild cereal grass, was
                  the foundation crop for all Upper Missouri farmers. Edwin Denig, an American Fur
                  Company official at Fort Union in the mid-nineteenth century, reported the Arikara
                  corn "seldom exceeds two and a half or three feet in height." Denig noted that
                  each cornstalk contained only a few ears with kernels "small, hard, and covered
                  with a thicker shell than that raised in warmer climates."<ref target="n0320" n="20"/> Although corn was the essential staple for diet and trade, other crops
                  were cultivated by Arikara farmers. Beans were planted in the corn hills so that
                  their vines could climb the stalks. Some of those bean seeds were collected by the
                  captains and sent to Jefferson, who in April 1807 planted them. He reported them
                  "very forward" in progress by April 18. On the first of May of the same year,
                  Jefferson planted some Arikara corn at Monticello and observed later that the
                  plants produced ears suitable for roasting about a week after those coming from
                  more familiar maize varieties.<ref target="n0321" n="21"/> Corn and beans, the two
                  sister crops, were joined by a third, squash. Clark recorded in his journal that
                  the Arikaras raised three kinds of squash.<ref target="n0322" n="22"/> Like Mandan
                  and Hidatsa farmers, Arikara women boiled some of the squash for immediate use
                  while slicing and drying most of the crop for winter consumption.<ref target="n0323" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p> The Arikaras also grew pumpkins, watermelons, and tobacco. The tobacco attracted
                  much of the expedition's attention. Both Lewis and Patrick Gass quickly recognized
                  that the Indian tobacco (<hi rend="italic">Nicotiana quadrivalis</hi>) was
                  something quite different from the Chesapeake varieties. Lewis, always interested
                  in precise botanical descriptions, observed that Arikara tobacco grew about three
                  feet high, was planted in hills, and was harvested in late summer. The captain
                  found smoking this tobacco "very pleasant." Gass agreed about the pipe qualities
                  of the blend but added that it was less suited for chewing.<ref target="n0324" n="24"/>
               </p>
               <p> The land used by Arikara farmers was held by family groups as corporate property.
                  Lewis and Clark reported, "They claim no land except that on which their villages
                  stand and the fields which they cultivate." The fields were generally plots of
                  about one or one-and-a-half acres. Each family's land was carefully marked with
                  brush and pole fences. Apparently, there were two kinds of Arikara farm lands seen
                  by the expedition and by later visitors. Very close to the villages were fenced
                  garden plots. As trade demands for increased production mounted, fields up to a
                  mile away from the village center were cleared. Planting began in April or May,
                  depending on weather and ground conditions, and harvest of the major corn crop was
                  in early August.<ref target="n0325" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> As in many other American Indian tribes, Arikara women did the farming.
                  Europeans, accustomed to seeing men in the fields, consistently misunderstood the
                  native division of labor and labeled Indian women "squaw drudges." Clark was not
                  immune to that cultural blindness and insisted that Arikara women "do the drugery
                  as Common amongst Savages." Tabeau went further and charged that village women
                  were virtual slaves to tyrannical husbands.<ref target="n0326" n="26"/> What
                  Clark, Tabeau, and other Europeans did not understand was the seasonal nature of
                  woman's work, their companionship in the shared labor, the elevated ritual status
                  of Arikara women because of their role as earth mothers, and the substantial
                  demands made on men in trade, war, and hunting. Arikara women farmed, using two
                  simple but effective tools. Hoes or digging sticks were made from the shoulder
                  blades of buffalo or deer. These scapular hoes were used to break ground and keep
                  weeds from overgrowing the plots. A second implement was a rake fashioned by
                  binding reeds to a long handle. Despite the uncertainties of climate and flooding,
                  Arikara agriculture was very productive. As late as 1853, Arikara farmers grew
                  five thousand bushels of corn for sale outside the villages.<ref target="n0327" n="27"/>
               </p>
               <p> Agriculture was the foundation of the Arikara economy, but hunting buffalo and
                  other game animals was also important. When the corn crop failed, as it did in the
                  summer of 1803 because of severe flooding, many Arikaras left the Moreau and Grand
                  River villages to hunt on the plains. Hunting was far more than an expedient in
                  hard times. The extended winter buffalo hunt was a necessary part of the Arikaras'
                  food supply. In October or November, hunting parties would leave the river
                  villages in search of the herds. The mounted hunters carried skin tepees with them
                  as they traveled far from the villages. Because of the close relationship between
                  the Arikaras and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, village hunters sometimes spent the winter alongside the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. The Arikara buffalo hunt was, at least until the mid-nineteenth
                  century, strictly regulated by warriors especially selected for the occasion.
                  Those warriors would arrange the placement of hunters and give signals for the
                  rush to kill the animals. Their buffalo hunting was sometimes limited by
                  interference from the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Anxious to remain the prime suppliers of hides and meat to the
                  Arikaras, Teton bands blockaded the villages and kept hunters away from the herds.
                  This happened in October 1803 and was further evidence of Tabeau's observation
                  that the buffalo was "a very uncertain resource" for the Arikaras.<ref target="n0328" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> As Lewis and Clark neared the Grand River villages, they slowly learned about two
                  aspects of Arikara life that would shape their relations with the Indians. Arikara
                  politics might be best characterized as chaotic factionalism—a maze of
                  interlocking lineage, village, and band loyalties complicated by the consequences
                  of devastating epidemics. Just as Lewis and Clark had to thread their way through
                  Brulé Teton politics, so would they have to cope with men like Kakawissassa,
                  Kakawita, Pocasse, and Piahito. But with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> encounter still fresh in their minds, it was a second dimension
                  of Arikara life that commanded more of the captains' attention. During the
                  troubled days at the Bad River, Lewis and Clark had heard about the complex web of
                  trade that bound Upper Missouri villagers and many western nomads together in an
                  intricate system of cooperation, exchange, and intimidation. The importance of
                  that system would be brought home to the explorers with considerable force during
                  their interlude with the Arikaras.</p>
               <p> Arikara farmers were part of the Missouri Trade System. Their towns were the
                  locale's focal points for the system while the Mandan and Hidatsa villages on the
                  Knife River served as the upper exchange centers. The villagers were engaged in
                  supplying the agricultural needs of the nomads. Lewis and Clark aptly described
                  the Arikara farmers as the "gardners for the Soues."<ref target="n0329" n="29"/>
                  They grew corn, raised horses, and processed hides in return for a wide variety of
                  merchandise and foodstuffs brought by their western and southwestern customers.
                  Clark listed among those customers the Arapahos, Comanches, Kiowas, Osages, and
                  Tawehashs. But the most important customers of the Arikaras were the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>.<ref target="n0330" n="30"/> The Arikaras' dealings with these
                  two tribes were quite different, and those differences played a central role in
                  expedition-Indian relations.</p>
               <p> The often-troubled relationship between the Arikara villages and Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands was an uneasy symbiosis. From a Teton perspective, some
                  sort of control had to be maintained over the Arikaras. As Teton population
                  expanded west of the Missouri, reliable sources of food had to be found. Both
                  Black Buffalo and the Partisan made plain to the captains the long-term <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> interest in controlling the flow of manufactured goods upriver to
                  the village farmers. The overriding <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> need was for the Arikaras' food products and horses. Just how
                  strong that need was can be seen in a preexpedition incident involving Black
                  Buffalo and his family. Sometime around 1800, one of Black Buffalo's brothers paid
                  a visit to the Arikara town at Ashley Island. Kakawita, Tabeau's host, evidently
                  had a grudge against the Brulé man. When he killed Black Buffalo's brother,
                  the Brulé chief took revenge on five or six Arikaras and a larger conflict
                  seemed imminent. But as the August trading time approached and Arikara corn
                  ripened, all thoughts of warfare disappeared.<ref target="n0331" n="31"/> For the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, corn was more important than blood. That August, as in every
                  other late summer and early fall, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands flocked to the Arikara towns, bringing meat, fat, and hides
                  from the plains and European-manufactured goods from the Dakota Rendezvous.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark, like other non-Indian observers, consistently misunderstood the
                     Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> connection. Already disposed to cast the Tetons as
                  "that lawless, savage, and rapacious race," the captains viewed the relationship
                  as one of colonial exploitation. Clark believed that this economic link meant
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> political domination of the Arikaras. As he explained, the Tetons
                  maintained "great influence over the Rickeres, poison[ed] their minds and [kept]
                  them in perpetial dread." To the captains, Arikara villagers seemed helpless
                  victims of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> aggression. In both their written records and in their
                  diplomacy, Lewis and Clark argued that a disruption of the Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> alliance would free the village farmers from tyranny and might
                  force Teton bands to accept American trade terms. The explorers, who had only
                  limited experience with the Arikaras, were not alone in believing that the
                  villagers were an oppressed people. The trader Tabeau insisted that the Arikaras
                  functioned as "a certain kind of serf" for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. He declared that the Arikaras were so fully dominated by the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> that they were even compelled to buy their bows and arrows from
                  the Tetons.<ref target="n0332" n="32"/>
               </p>
               <p> But this harsh view of Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> relations was not shared by the Arikaras themselves. They saw
                  many advantages in the connection not quickly evident to outsiders. The economic
                  advantages included a source of manufactured goods, especially guns, and a
                  reliable market for corn and horses. Tabeau and the captains tended to overstate
                  the violence and intimidation present in Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> dealings. There was, in fact, far more cooperation in times of
                  war and friendship in times of peace. Much of the tension Lewis and Clark were to
                  encounter between the Arikaras and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> was based on raids carried out by joint Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> war parties against the Knife River Mandan and Hidatsa villages.
                  Among the objects sent back from Fort Mandan was a buffalo robe painting of one
                  such raid in 1797.<ref target="n0333" n="33"/> The Arikaras knew well the military
                  power of the Tetons, but they also knew how important their corn was to <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> survival. Truteau was close to the mark when he wrote in 1795
                  that "the Ricaras and this <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"

                  to obtain guns, clothes, hats, kettles, clothes, etc., which are given them in

                  overpower them."<ref target="n0334" n="34"/>
               </p>
               <p> The captains themselves ran into the determination of the Arikaras to continue

                  River villages on the return journey, the explorer-diplomats tried in vain to
                  convince the Arikara chiefs to sever <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> ties. Several chiefs, who grasped the Upper Missouri balance of
                  trade and power better than the neophyte Americans, replied that they "must trade
                  with the Sieoux one more time to get guns and powder; that they had no guns or
                  powder and more horses than they had use for, [and] after they got guns and powder
                  . . . they would never again have any thing to do with them."<ref target="n0335" n="35"/> The captains had been put off in the best traditions of international
                  diplomacy; once again their desire to rearrange traditional patterns of Indian
                  behavior was thwarted.</p>
               <p> If the captains and the Arikaras had very different perceptions of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, both parties agreed that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> were far more acceptable and less troublesome customers. The
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, who had abandoned farming in the eastern prairie
                  valleys to become a plains people, depended heavily on the Arikaras for foodstuffs
                  and tobacco. Each summer many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> journeyed to the Arikara villages to trade and renew old
                  friendships. Some advance groups came in mid-June while larger parties arrived in
                  mid-July. Some remained with the Arikaras well into the fall months, as Lewis and
                  Clark discovered. Cheyenne traders brought to the Arikaras a wide variety of
                  perishable meat products as well as exquisite skin clothing made by their women.
                  The Arikaras especially valued "shirts of antelope skin, ornamented and worked
                  with different colored quills of the porcupine." In addition to meat and fancy
                  clothing, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> also brought flour made from pounded prairie apples. Much of
                  what they offered might be classed as luxury goods, but there was one <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> commodity that Arikara middlemen were very anxious to possess.
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> horses were essential to fill out herds in
                  preparation for trading with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. The Arikaras wanted <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> horses so badly that they were willing to trade precious guns,
                  powder, and shot for them. During the Lewis and Clark period, the Arikaras were
                  prepared to trade one gun, one hundred rounds of ammunition, and a knife for one
                  horse. The result of this trade, however, was that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> relations were often tense because the Teton bands resented
                  seeing Arikara corn in <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"

               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark, arriving at the Arikara villages in October, did not see the
                  festive trading days of August and September. Some fifteen to sixteen hundred
                  people had thronged the trade fair, described by Tabeau as "this great gathering
                  of different nations." Although there was always the threat of violence,
                  especially between the competitive <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, the trading days were better occasions to make bargains and
                  visit old friends. "Times are lively," noted Edwin Denig, "feasting and dancing
                  goes on constantly, both in the village and camp—horse racing, gambling in
                  many ways. Bucks and belles dressed in their best and tricked out in all the gaudy
                  colors of cloth, paints, and porcupine quills may be seen mingled in the dance or
                  exchanging their professions of love in more solitary places. The old men smoke
                  and eat without intermission. The middle aged exchange horses and other property.
                  The soldiers gamble. And the young warriors spend both day and night in attempts
                  at seduction of the young women in both camps. Strange scenes are witnessed here,
                  much that would be interesting, much more that would be indescribable."<ref target="n0337" n="37"/> Although the captains had not experienced those scenes,
                  they surely had to face the consequences of those trading days. The alliances and
                  friendships forged during the trade fairs would shape the responses of the Indians
                  to Lewis and Clark's diplomacy in the days to come.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark saw little of the Arikaras' ritual life during their brief
                  October stay. Had they come earlier, they might have witnessed the impressive
                  blessing-of-the-corn ceremony done to ensure an abundant harvest. Tabeau, who saw
                  the three-day celebration, wrote that "everything breathes gaiety at this
                  festival." An elaborate altar was set up in the lodge of the principal village
                  chief. That altar was festooned with large gourds, arrows decorated to look like
                  corn stalks, green branches, and dried meat. Empty baskets and scapular hoes were
                  placed before the altar to symbolize the hope for a bountiful harvest. Crowns of
                  plaited straw were to ward off insects and green branches were offerings to the
                  moon and stars to gain good weather. To honor their role in agriculture, women
                  arrayed in their best clothing sat near the center posts of the lodge. Having
                  missed this ritual, Lewis and Clark could not comment on it, nor on the many
                  beliefs and rites surrounding the buffalo. Although the captains and their men
                  spent considerable time visiting the Arikaras, no journalist in the expedition
                  took note of the private altars and painted buffalo skulls present in every earth
                  lodge. Nor did the explorers set down Arikara ideas about the many spirits in
                  their universe and the central force, "the Master of Life."<ref target="n0338" n="38"/>
               </p>
               <p> Because the expedition's members usually seemed aware of Indian architecture and
                  village design, it is even more surprising that no journal contains any reference
                  to the Arikara medicine lodge. This ritual lodge was often the largest earth
                  structure in the village. Located near the center of the village, it shared some
                  construction features with domestic lodges: four primary interior posts, a central
                  fire pit, and a walled entrance passage. The lodge measured some fifty or sixty
                  feet in diameter and, unlike the circular domestic lodges, was octagonal in shape.
                  Inside the medicine lodge and opposite the entrance was a low platform or altar
                  for ritual offerings.<ref target="n0339" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p> If Lewis and Clark were oblivious to the ritual ties that bound Arikara life
                  together, they were very aware of the powerful force that threatened to unravel
                  it. Beginning in the 1780s, smallpox epidemics swept through the Missouri trench,
                  wreaking terrible havoc on all Indians. In the period before the epidemics, the
                  Arikaras numbered perhaps twenty thousand to thirty thousand persons.<ref target="n0340" n="40"/> They belonged to many bands and lived in dozens of
                  villages along the Missouri. The general western pandemic of 1780–81 killed
                  perhaps seventy-five percent of the Arikara population, causing the abandonment of
                  many villages and the amalgamation of numerous political groups. When Truteau
                  visited the Arikaras in 1795, he was told that there had already been three
                  epidemics, reducing thirty-two villages to a mere handful.<ref target="n0341" n="41"/> That wave of disease was followed in 1801–1802 by another one.
                  Tabeau, writing about the 1803–1804 period, reported that "of the eighteen
                  fairly large villages, situated upon the Missouri at some distance from each
                  other, the Ricaras are reduced to three very mediocre ones." Although Tabeau
                  recognized the role of war in this dramatic population decline, he was emphatic in
                  arguing that smallpox "unexpectedly made this terrible ravage among them." Lewis
                  and Clark were only recording the obvious when they blandly noted that the Arikara
                  were "much reduced" from previous numbers.<ref target="n0342" n="42"/>
               </p>
               <p> For the history of expedition-Indian relations, the impact of the epidemics was
                  most clearly seen in Arikara politics. Although there is little evidence that the
                  Arikaras developed political integration beyond the village level before the
                  1780–81 pandemic, the waves of disease so shattered the ranks of chiefs,
                  elders, bundle holders, and important women as to make future intervillage
                  leadership highly unlikely. As their numbers dropped and survivors from many
                  different villages and lineages clustered into what amounted to refugee towns,
                  intense factionalism flared between dozens of once powerful chiefs and warriors.
                  Just as Lewis and Clark have to confront Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> internal politics, now they would have to deal with the domestic
                  rivalries present in the three Grand River settlements.</p>
               <p> Truteau was the first non-Indian to analyze Arikara factional politics. The
                  French trader recognized that the villages he knew around the Cheyenne River in
                  1795 were filled with the survivors of earlier epidemics. The chiefs were
                  constantly engaged in "differences of opinion and wrangles for authority." Truteau
                  bealived that this factionalism, or "jealousy" as he termed it, was "the sole
                  cause of their discord and their divisions." He reported that these factional
                  controversies were sufficiently intense to cause some Arikaras to move north to
                  the Mandan region while others drifted south to live with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnees</ref>.<ref target="n0343" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p> Tabeau, who spent much more time with the Arikaras than either Truteau or the
                  captains, added much valuable detail to Truteau's concept of factionalism bred by
                  disease. Tabeau had firsthand experience with the rivalries between Indian
                  leaders. When he arrived among the Arikaras, he became the object of much
                  bickering between the Ashley Island village's civil chief Kakawissassa and a war
                  chief named Kakawita. Both men wanted the honor and prestige of having Tabeau as a
                  house guest. But the argument went well beyond hospitality. Whoever played host to
                  the trader would reap considerable influence in village life. For Kakawita, leader
                  of a small village recently come to Ashley Island, snaring Tabeau meant economic
                  advantage and increased power. The Frenchman had another lesson in Arikara
                  factionalism when in August 1803 he attempted to convene a grand council to
                  discuss trade arrangements. Knowing how many Arikara males were designated as
                  chiefs, the trader carefully invited forty-two of the leading men. To his
                  surprise, he was berated for neglecting so many others. As Tabeau aptly put it,
                  the Arikara towns were filled with "captains without companies."<ref target="n0344" n="44"/> Dialect differences, old rivalries, important families
                  weakened by disease, and leaders without followers all made Arikara politics
                  treacherous ground for any outsider.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> At the time Lewis and Clark visited them, the Arikaras were living in three large
                  villages on the Missouri near the mouth of the Grand River. These villages were
                  founded sometime in the late 1790s after the Arikaras abandoned their North Dakota
                     settlements.<ref target="n0345" n="45"/> The first Arikara village encountered
                  by the expedition was Sawa-haini, which consisted of about sixty earth lodges on
                  Ashley Island in the Missouri River. The island was fully cultivated, with corn
                  and tobacco especially evident. Both Tabeau and the captains reported that
                  Kakawissassa, or the Crow at Rest, was the leading civil chief in Sawa-haini.
                  However, during the Lewis and Clark period his authority was challenged by
                  Kakawita, or Man Crow, war chief of the small village of Narhkarica recently come
                  to Sawa-haini. When the captains returned in 1806, Kakawissassa told them he had
                  given his chief's medal to yet another Sawa-haini chief, a man named Grey Eyes.
                  People living on the island, along with those at the second village, were known to
                  the captains as Arikaras-proper in order to distinguish them from the ethnically
                  diverse Arikaras of the third town. That second village was upriver a short
                  distance from Sawa-haini. Part of what archaeologists call the Leavenworth Site
                  (39C09), Rhtarahe was the lower of the two villages to share this location.
                  Rhtarahe had about sixty to seventy lodges. Pocasse or Hay was the leading civil
                  chief. Cottonwood Creek separated the earth lodges of Rhtarahe from those of
                  Waho-erha. European visitors to the Arikaras recognized that Waho-erha was
                  different from the other villages in both language and ethnic mix. Answering a
                  query from Nicholas Biddle in 1810, Clark reported that Waho-erha was composed of
                  nine different tribes who had not been involved in recent (1790s) troubles with
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> as had the Arikaras-proper. Clark noted, "A
                  difference in pronounciation and some difference of language may be discovered
                  between them and the Arikara proper."<ref target="n0346" n="46"/> Tabeau, who had
                  more experience with the Arikaras, agreed with Clark's observation. The French
                  trader characterized the differing Arikara accents and inflections as "the tower
                  of Babel." The leading civil chief in Waho-erha was Piahito, or Hawk's Feather.
                  Unlike the Hidatsas, who developed an intervillage council in the 1780s,
                  factionalism and old suspicions kept the Arikara bands divided. Each village would
                  face the American visitors alone.<ref target="n0347" n="47"/>

            <div type="section">
               <p> On October 8, 1804, as the Corps of Discovery passed the mouth of the Grand
                  River, two of the explorers cam upon the Ashley Island village of Sawa-haini.
                  Clark described the three-mile-long island as "covered with fields, where those
                  people raise their corn, tobacco, beans etc." As the flotilla passed the island,
                  many Arikaras lined the banks to gawk at the strangers. The men were dressed in
                  buffalo robes, leggings, and moccasins while the women wore fringed antelope
                  dresses. Clark noted that most of the warriors were well armed with northwest
                  trade guns.<ref target="n0348" n="48"/> On a sandbar opposite the village were
                  more Arikara sightseers and a French trader. While Clark led most of the party to
                  a campsite beyond the island, Lewis and several crewmen in a pirogue went to talk
                  with the trader. The captains had been told in St. Louis that they might meet one
                  "Mr. Tebeaux," who could give the explorers "much information in relation to that
                     country."<ref target="n0349" n="49"/> The Frenchman on shore was Tabeau's
                  fellow trader, Joseph Gravelines. Clark described him as "a man well versed in the
                  language of this nation [who] gave us some information relitive to the Country,
                  nation etc."<ref target="n0350" n="50"/> Both Gravelines and Tabeau spoke the
                  Arikara and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> languages, skills much in demand for the Arikara talks.
                  Later in the evening Lewis, Gravelines, and some of the party went to Sawa-haini
                  carrying tobacco for a get-acquainted smoke. Heartened by that event and reassured
                  by Gravelines and Tabeau that the Arikaras were "all friendly and glad to see us,"
                  the captains prepared for serious diplomacy the next day.<ref target="n0351" n="51"/>
               </p>
               <p> At camp during that first evening among the Arikaras, Lewis and Clark may well
                  have discussed American diplomatic goals as applied to the Grand River villagers.
                  The captains surely did not accept Truteau's claim that the Arikaras were "the key
                  to the passages which we must traverse to reach all the nations higher up the
                     Missouri."<ref target="n0352" n="52"/> That distinction was reserved for the
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Nonetheless, the explorer-diplomats did not
                  underestimate the importance of the Arikaras both as military allies of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and as potential American trading partners. They knew from their
                  St. Louis contacts that the Arikaras had harrassed traders and often blocked their
                  access upriver to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Clark was honestly concerned about the reception the
                  expedition would receive when he wrote that the Americans were prepared for war or
                  peace with the villagers. Jefferson had not given the explorers the kind of
                  precise instructions for the Arikara negotiations as he had for dealings with the
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. However, the general observations in the president's
                  instructions to Lewis and the recent experiences with the Tetons served to clarify
                  what the expedition hoped to achieve while at the Arikara villages. On one level
                  these objectives were the same as pursued since the beginning of the voyage. The
                  captains were to assert United States sovereignty over Louisiana Purchase lands.
                  Military parades and airgun displays were put on to make Indians stand in awe of
                  American power. As they had done with other tribes, Lewis and Clark planned to
                  distribute medals and uniforms to chiefs ready to support American authority. Old
                  rivalries were to be forgotten and peace was to obtain among all the tribes. Such
                  a peace was a prerequisite for another cornerstone of American policy: the
                  promotion of trade with American merchants. Although the captains knew from St.
                  Louis informants and from conversations with Tabeau and Gravelines that the
                  Arikaras could not supply beaver pelts, the market for goods to replace those of
                  English manufacture was great.<ref target="n0353" n="53"/>
               </p>
               <p> Sovereignty, client chiefs, and trade were all important subjects for discussion
                  with the Arikara chiefs. But if the events of the interlude with the Arikaras
                  proved any test, Lewis and Clark had other things on their minds as well. Those
                  other concerns focused on the complex relations between the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, the Arikaras, and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas. The explorers only gradually sensed how intricate
                  those relations were. As they began talks with the Arikaras, the captains
                  perceived the Tetons as ferocious enemies to undercut, the Arikaras as unwilling
                  dupes of the rapacius <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas as a force of unknown dimensions. With a naive
                  optimism typical of so much Euro-American frontier diplomacy, Lewis and Clark
                  believed they could easily reshape Upper Missouri realities to fit their
                  expectations. The Arikaras were to be weaned away from dependence on the Tetons.
                  An American-inspired alliance of all Upper Missouri villagers might further weaken
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. On the night before the negotiations began, those
                  goals seemed within reach. Lewis and Clark knew from Tabeau and Gravelines that
                  Arikara moves had been underway in the past six months to lessen tensions with the
                  Knife River peoples. But the captains also knew that the Laocata band of Arikaras
                  had done all it could to sabotage an Arikara-Mandan peace. The Laocata action was
                  a reminder that the violent events of the 1790s were not forgotten. Weakening the
                     Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> connection and promoting peace among all the Upper
                  Missouri villagers seemed a rational and beneficial policy to both the captains
                  and their trader allies.<ref target="n0354" n="54"/> To the surprise of the
                  explorer-diplomats, virtually all Indian parties proved resistant to change and
                  suspicious of American motives.</p>
               <p> During the Teton face-off it had been evident that Brulé politicians like
                  Black Buffalo and the Partisan had a clear concept of Teton interests and the
                  personal stature to make decisions promoting those interests. In the Arikara
                  political world of "captains without companies," it proved more difficult to
                  articulate a policy toward non-Indian outsiders. Civil chiefs, leading warriors,
                  elders, and important families found their authority fragmented and open to
                  challenge in the troubled times after the epidemics. Having the remnants of
                  several bands living in one village made for political tensions unknown in Arikara
                  life before disease forced such amalgamation. This state of affairs would remain
                  unchanged for years. When the Astorians were among the Arikaras in 1811, some
                  village chiefs attempted to block the progress of that expedition unless
                  substantial gifts were offered. This decision was openly opposed by several elders
                  who urged the Arikaras to "behave well towards white people," arguing that "the
                  advantages they derived by intercourse with them" far outweighed any danger.<ref target="n0355" n="55"/> In the fall of 1804, village chiefs like Kakawissassa
                  and Piahito had considerable influence, but their power to determine and enforce
                  policies was limited by cultural attitudes toward leadership as well as by the
                  presence of refugee bands who did not accept decisions made by others. Chiefs,
                  leading families, and ordinary Arikaras saw little reason to exchange valuable and
                  reliable dealings with the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> for the uncertainties of St. Louis trade and Mandan friendship.
                  Village chiefs would be polite to the white strangers and might even make some
                  promises, but the real Arikara interest was to have the Americans move on with the
                  least disruption to the old ways of war and trade.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark hoped to begin talks with the Arikaras on October 9. Invitations
                  had been sent by way of Gravelines and Tabeau to Kakawissassa, Pocasse, and
                  Piahito. A flag pole had been raised at the expedition's camp and some
                  preparations were underway to begin the now-familiar display of military pomp and
                  hardware. Sometime before noon the three chiefs appeared and the obligatory
                  smoking began. The visual impact of Lewis and Clark's diplomacy required good
                  weather for marching, shooting, and distributing gifts. When it became plain that
                  this Tuesday would be windy, rainy, and cold, all agreed to postpone discussions
                  until the following day. The Arikaras and Americans spent the rest of the day
                  visiting each other. During those visits, York proved to be the greatest
                  attraction, as he would be on subsequent days. Clark wrote that the villagers were
                  "much astonished at my black Servent, who did not lose the opportunity of
                  displaying his powers, strength etc."<ref target="n0356" n="56"/>
               </p>
               <p> Clear weather the next day seemed promising for a council session. After
                  breakfast with Tabeau and Gravelines, the captains made all the necessary
                  preparations for the Arikaras' arrival. After the flag was raised and many of the
                  men donned dress uniforms, the camp was ready to greet its Indian visitors. By
                  midmorning Kakawissassa and several leading men from Sawa-haini had arrived. But
                  to the captains' dismay, delegations from the two other villages were
                  conspicuously absent. That absence was a clear indication of the tension between
                  the Arikara towns. Pocasse, Piahito, and their respective village councils were
                  fearful that Lewis and Clark might make Kakawissassa the "grand chief." Such an
                  action would upset the Arikara balance of power and possibly had no precedent in
                  Arikara history. The captains, having learned something about internal Indian
                  politics while among the Tetons, recognized the source of the Arikaras' concern.
                  Clark observed, "We have every reason to believe that a gellousy exists between
                  the Villages for fear of our making the first chief from the lower village." But
                  recognizing the problem did not mean that Lewis and Clark were willing to alter
                  their decision to make Kakawissassa the first or grand chief. At noon,
                  increasingly concerned over the delay and worried that the talks might crumble,
                  the captains asked Gravelines to go over to the villages and again invite Pocasse
                  and Piahito to the council.<ref target="n0357" n="57"/>
               </p>
               <p> Early in the afternoon the two reluctant chiefs and several principal men arrived
                  at the expedition's camp. After smoking the required pipe, Lewis stood and "read a
                  speech to them giving them good counsel." This prepared talk, interpreted to the
                  Arikaras by Gravelines, was probably the same one delivered to other tribes from
                  the beginning of the voyage. As the captains told the Otos, "the great chief of
                  the Seventeen great nations of America, impelled by his parental regard for his
                  newly adopted children on the troubled waters, has sent us out to clear the road,
                  remove every obstruction, and make it the road of peace between himself and his
                  red children residing there."<ref target="n0358" n="58"/> The speech stressed the
                  now-familiar themes of federal Indian policy in the early Trans-Mississippi West.
                  The acceptance of United States sovereignty, peace between the tribes, and trade
                  with American merchants would be rewarded by the protection and favor of the great
                  chief of the seventeen fires.</p>
               <p> As Lewis was slowly reading his speech, Clark's attention was seized by something
                  in the audience that put a new urgency to the negotiations: the presence of two
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, one of whom Clark recognized from the troubled days at
                  the Bad River. Clark was certain that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were there to thwart the progress of the expedition and retain
                  some measure of control over Arikara affairs. If the Teton ambassadors succeeded
                  in playing on the Arikaras' fears, especially those of Pocasse and Piahito, Lewis
                  and Clark might have to face a second Upper Missouri Indian confrontation.<ref target="n0359" n="59"/>
               </p>
               <p> With Lewis's talk finished, the display of military firepower and the
                  all-important distribution of gifts began. As if to put an exclamation point to
                  Lewis's presentation, three shots were fired from the bow swivel gun on the
                  keelboat. The captains may have hoped the two <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> would be reminded of how close those guns had come to firing on
                  their warriors just a few days before. When the smoke cleared, out came gift bale
                  number fifteen, marked and prepared for the Arikaras' use months before in St.
                  Louis. The bale contained a bewildering array of goods, all representing what the
                  Arikaras might obtain by trading directly with St. Louis merchants. There was a
                  pound of vermilion paint for the warriors, three pewter looking glasses for young
                  girls, and over four hundred needles for Arikara women. Lewis and Clark laid out
                  their country store of merchandise, ranging from cloth, beads, combs, razors, and
                  rolls of wire to nine pairs of scissors, knives, tomahawks, and even six Jew's
                  harps. For the chiefs there were military coats, cocked hats, medals, and American
                  flags. Notably absent from the gifts was any alcohol. The Arikaras made it plain
                  to all European visitors that the drink was unwelcome. As they explained to Clark,
                  those whites who gave Indians alcohol were not friends but were simply interested
                  in seeing natives act the fool.<ref target="n0360" n="60"/>
               </p>
               <p> Knowing that there was "gellousy" among the three Arikara villages over whose
                  chief was to be afforded highest honors, the captains might have exercised some
                  caution in handing out uniforms and medals and in naming chiefs to certain ranks.
                  But Euro-American practice had always been to designate one Indian as the
                  principal chief, whether that particular group sanctioned such a position or not.
                  Lewis and Clark were not about to break with tradition, even if it caused more
                  tension within Arikara politics and made <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> efforts at sowing discord easier. Kakawissassa of Saw-haini was
                  named "grand chief" with the appropriate medal, while Pocasse and Piahito were
                  offered medals of lesser grades. At the same time, perhaps to soothe bruised
                  pride, other goods were given to each chief in equal measure. To signal the end of
                  the conference, the airgun was brought out and fired. Ordway observed that the
                  chiefs "appeared to be astonished at the sight of it and the execution it would
                  do." As was their custom, the Arikara chiefs told Lewis and Clark that an answer,
                  or rather three answers, to the American speech would come the next day. This was
                  neither an attempt to deceive the explorers nor a ploy to draw out the
                  negotiations. Rather, it was an acceptance of the fact that all decisions were the
                  result of a consensus reached by elders in a village council. Since there was no
                  Arikara tribal council, each village would present a separate reply. The presence
                  of Teton representatives and the naming of Kakawissassa as leading chief only
                  complicated the Arikaras' task of responding to the American views.<ref target="n0361" n="61"/>
               </p>
               <p> With the talks over, Ordway and one other expedition member went to visit
                  Rhtarahe while Gass took a party to sample food and hospitality at Sawa-haini.
                  That afternoon of sightseeing and friendly talk produced some valuable information
                  about Arikara life as well as scenes of comic proportion. Ordway's congenial stay
                  in Rhtarahe gave the sergeant and his companion a chance to sample the Arikara
                  diet. Welcomed into Pocasse's lodge, the Americans sat on woven mats and were
                  served by the chief's wife. They were brought a bowl of beans and corn, the staple
                  of Arikara fare. Following that dish, three different but unnamed Indian foods
                  were offered to the Americans. "We ate some of each," wrote Ordway, "and found
                  very good." If he was fascinated with Indian menus, the Arikaras were equally
                  intrigued by the looks and manners of the explorers. Ordway wrote later that those
                  Indians "were very friendly to us and seemed to be desirous to talk with us and
                  scarcely kept their eyes off us."<ref target="n0362" n="62"/> Usually a keen
                  observer of the common things in native life, Ordway strangely neglected to record
                  anything about the interior furnishings of the earth lodge. In fact, no journalist
                  in the expedition took note of lodge interiors.</p>
               <p> While Ordway was tasting Arikara cooking, Gass's party made its way to Ashley
                  Island. If Ordway failed to examine lodge furnishings, Gass did not neglect
                  details of exterior construction. His careful description, quoted earlier, is the
                  best surviving account of Arikara housing. He offered an earth lodge portrait that
                  squares with archaeological studies done at the two upper villages.<ref target="n0363" n="63"/> But it was York who proved the center of attraction
                  that afternoon. The Arikaras were both attracted to and terrified by his
                  blackness. Having never seen a black man, they were quite unsure if York was a
                  man, a beast, or a strange and powerful spirit being. Clark later explained that
                  Arikaras who had seen whites but not blacks thought York "something strange &amp;
                  from his very large size more vicious than whites." On the other hand, those
                  Arikaras who had seen neither whites nor blacks were convinced that all members of
                  the expedition, regardless of color, were possessed with extraordinary powers.
                  York thoroughly enjoyed his newfound celebrity status and had already "made
                  himself more turribal" than the captains wished.<ref target="n0364" n="64"/> That
                  afternoon York and hordes of Arikara children had chased each other, the black man
                  bellowing at them that he was a wild bear caught and tamed by Captain Clark. What
                  may have worried the captains in this playful sport was York's boast that he ate
                  human flesh. The Arikaras practiced ritual cannibalism of their fallen enemies,
                  but that was a far cry from consuming village youth.<ref target="n0365" n="65"/>
                  With Arikara chiefs embroiled in factional disputes and Teton agents ready to use
                  those tensions against the expedition, Lewis and Clark did not need rumors
                  drifting through the earth lodges that the Americans kept a great he-bear ready to
                  eat Indian children.</p>
               <p> Some of the captains' fears about Arikara reactions evaporated the next morning.
                  Toward noon, Kakawissassa arrived at the expedition's camp. In accordance with the
                  notion of reciprocity in gift giving, the Arikara leader brought baskets of corn,
                  beans, and dried squash. While those provisions were surely appreciated,
                  Kakawissassa's reply to Lewis's speech was even more welcome.</p>
               <p> The chief's speech contained three important elements. First, there was the
                  immediate question of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> influence on the Arikaras' behavior toward the expedition. The
                  two Teton emissaries had certainly argued for some direct action against the
                  explorers. Although the Arikaras were not known as great warriors, in the years
                  after Lewis and Clark they would be very effective in blocking American access up
                  the Missouri. But Kakawissassa made it plain at the beginning that the Arikaras'
                  weapons would not be turned against the explorers. "Can you think," declared the
                  chief, "any one dare put their hands on your rope of your boat. No! not one dare."
                  Proclaiming the road open, Kakawissassa turned to his second point. In reply to
                  the call for intertribal peace, the chief asked the captains to "speak good words"
                  to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> on behalf of the Arikaras. Seeing two of their
                  diplomatic goals seemingly accepted without opposition or argument, Lewis and
                  Clark must have been pleased when the Arikara chief expressed an interest in
                  becoming part of the St. Louis trade system. Although Kakawissassa lamented the
                  fact that beaver pelts were not available for Arikara women to process, he
                  promised a good supply of buffalo robes. More important, he promised to aid
                  American traders in entering <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> and Arapaho markets.<ref target="n0366" n="66"/>
               </p>
               <p> Taken at face value, what Kakawissassa told Lewis and Clark promised a real
                  victory for American policy and the expedition's negotiating skill. After the
                  Teton troubles, the captains needed such a victory. But Kakawissassa's speech was
                  actually much more and much less than it appeared to be. That the captains
                  accepted it literally only suggests how innocent they were of Indian realities. On
                  the issue of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-inspired attempts to forcibly detain the expedition,
                  Kakawissassa was forth-right in saying that Teton advice had been rejected. Lewis
                  and Clark took this to signal a weakening of the Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> alliance. But postexpedition events did not bear out the
                  captains' optimistic evaluation. The Arikaras were not about to abandon their
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> trade connection for an uncertain link with St. Louis. American
                  merchants, interested in beaver, could not take the place of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> middlemen as both suppliers of manufactured goods and customers
                  for Arikara corn and horses. Arikara life was based on the production of
                  agricultural surpluses that would have little place in an American fur trade. That
                  the Arikaras did not envision severing the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> alliance was to be made painfully clear in 1807, when both Manuel
                  Lisa and Nathaniel Pryor encountered hostility from Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> forces.</p>
               <p> The Mandan peace overture, an integral part of Lewis and Clark Indian diplomacy,
                  also was not quite what the Arikara speaker made it out to be. Despite their best
                  efforts during the talks with the Arikaras and later during the winter at Fort
                  Mandan, the captains found the old Arikra-Mandan tensions not easily overcome. The
                  peace policy, actually part of a larger anti-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> thrust, was doomed to failure by both Teton military power and
                  persistent villager rivalries. In 1810, an Arikara-Mandan alliance would field
                  several war parties against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, but those joint ventures would be short-lived. More important,
                  the Teton bands engaged in massive economic retaliation against Arikara towns,
                  ensuring the demise of any villager alliance.<ref target="n0367" n="67"/> It may
                  be that the willingness of the Arikaras to allow Lewis and Clark to pass unimpeded
                  was an abberation. In the years after the expedition, as Manuel Lisa brought the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> into the American trading orbit, the Arikaras assumed the Tetons'
                  old hostile role. Fearing that Mandan power was increasing by the St. Louis
                  connection while their fortunes declined, the Arikaras successfully blockaded the
                  Missouri. Certainly American agents and merchants like the Chouteaus and William
                  H. Ashley found the Arikaras to be implacable foes. Only gradually did American
                  diplomats learn that flowery speeches and a few gifts could not easily transform
                  Indian loyalties.</p>
               <p> But the nuances of Kakawissassa's speech eluded Lewis and Clark, and early in the
                  afternoon, believing they had achieved their goals, the captains ordered the
                  expedition a short distance upriver to a camp closer to the twin villages of
                  Rhtarahe and Waho-erha. With Kakawissassa and one of his nephews on board the
                  keelboat, the explorers made their way toward the upper villages. Pocasse joined
                  the boat party and late in the afternoon the whole group landed at a sandbar just
                  below Rhtarahe. They were greeted by knots of curious villagers anxious to catch a
                  glimpse of the strangers. The whole scene was made more colorful by several
                  American flags snapping in the river breeze. The captains paused for a moment to
                  take a sextant reading, something the Arikaras were certain was just one more
                  piece of the explorers' spiritual magic, and then walked up to Rhtarahe with
                  Pocasse. The chief made Lewis and Clark a gift of corn and beans while others in
                  the party ate Arikara porridge and bread. After staying some time at Rhtarahe
                  "talking on various subjects," the Americans paid a brief visit to Waho-erha and
                  its chief, Piahito. There, too, the explorers enjoyed Indian food and hospitality.
                  Promises were exchanged about talks the next day, and Clark judged the situation
                  that evening as "all tranquillity."<ref target="n0368" n="68"/>
               </p>
               <p> October 12 was the last full day the expedition spent among the Arikaras; nothing
                  happened to shake the captains' confidence that they had convinced village chiefs
                  to accept American policies. Yet, had the explorers listened more carefully to
                  speeches made by Pocasse and Piahito, they might have been less certain of their
                  victory. Lewis, Clark, and Gass, in the company of interpreters, spent the morning
                  listening to the chiefs' speeches while Ordway's boat parties did some small-scale
                     trading.<ref target="n0369" n="69"/>
               </p>
               <p> Those final talks began with the captains reminding the Arikaras of "the
                  magnitude and power of our country." Clark confidently recorded that those words
                  "pleased and astonished them verry much."<ref target="n0370" n="70"/> The speech
                  delivered by Pocasse contained much that the explorers wanted to hear. Pocasse
                  reaffirmed the obvious: the Arikaras planned no hostile action against the
                  expedition. He declared his interest in a Mandan peace and also expressed some
                  desire to visit with Jefferson. At the end of the talk, almost as an afterthought,
                  Pocasse suggested yet another doubt about severing the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> connection. With the exposed location of the villages and the
                  temporary nature of American forces, what guarantees of safety did the Arikaras
                  have against retaliation by the Tetons? Pocasse put it simply: "After you set out,
                  many nations in the open plains may come to make war against us, we wish you to
                  stop their guns and prevent it if possible."<ref target="n0371" n="71"/>
               </p>
               <p> The doubts and fears expressed by Pocasse were amplified when Lewis and Clark met
                  with Piahito. This Arikara chief gave the captains a quick lesson in Upper
                  Missouri power politics. The people of Waho-erha were distinct in language and
                  past history from the other villages. Waho-erha had not taken part in the recent
                  and still smoldering Mandan-Hidatsa war. Piahito was very skeptical that wounds
                  still fresh couuld be quickly healed by some of the expedition's diplomatic salve.
                  Had they more fully understood what Piahito had to say, Lewis and Clark might have
                  sensed how formidable a task it would be to rearrange traditional alliances and
                  cure old hurts.</p>
               <p> Piahito opened his remarks by bluntly saying he would believe a Mandan-Arikara
                  peace only when he saw it with his own eyes. As much as he doubted Mandan
                  intentions, he also questioned <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> motives, declaring that the Teton "has not a good heart." If
                  Piahito offered the captains some healthy skepticism about intertribal relations,
                  he also presented an equally realistic appraisal of intra-Arikara affairs. Piahito
                  said he always followed the lead of Kakawissassa and Pocasse and that they would
                  watch over Waho-erha while he went up to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Lewis and Clark wanted their message to be accepted by the
                  Arikara leadership, and Piahito reassured the explorers that at least Kakawissassa
                  and Pocasse "believe your words." But the Waho-erha chief also seemed to issue a
                  veiled warning about a unity of Arikara views more apparent than real. "Maybe we
                  will not tell the truth" was hardly the strong statement of approval the captains
                  wanted from the chief. Piahito again stressed his concern about a trip to the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. What would an alliance with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> mean, how might the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> react, and what possible benefits wouuld the Arikaras gain from
                  such a move? As the formal talks ended and one of the Arikara chiefs agreed to go
                  with the captains to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, all those doubts and questions were unresolved.<ref target="n0372" n="72"/>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> If official relations with the Arikaras were troubled by some unsettling issues,
                  unofficial and personal affairs with Arikara women went on quite satisfactorily.
                  For the first time since leaving St. Louis, the young men of the expedition had
                  ample time and opportunity for sexual contacts with Indian women. Those liaisons
                  must be understood from both sides of the cultural divide. To ignore them here and
                  later would be to deny the humanity of the expedition and to turn a blind eye on
                  much of the historical record.</p>
               <p> Sexual experiences, like all intimate encounters, may mean very different things
                  to persons of dissimilar cultures. The Arikaras' perception of sexual intercourse
                  and the role of women in the act differed markedly from that of the expedition's
                  males. First, it must be said that the Arikaras, like their Mandan and Hidatsa
                  neighbors, placed a very high value on women. They were the principal
                  agriculturists, and that economic position meant ritual prominence as well. Women
                  were neither the drudges nor the pawns of Arikara men so often portrayed in the
                  records of white visitors.<ref target="n0373" n="73"/> Further, Arikara
                  matrilineal society did not place as much importance on exclusive sexual relations
                  with male spouses. As one Arikara told Truteau, "When a man dies he cannot carry
                  women with him to the regions of the dead; and . . . they who quarrel, fight, and
                  kill each other about the possession of a woman, are fools or mad-men."<ref target="n0374" n="74"/> That young Arikara women were anxious for sexual
                  encounters with non-Indians was noted by virtually every visitor. As John Bradbury
                  put it, "Travelers who have been acquainted with savages, have remarked that they
                  are either very liberal of their women to strangers, or extremely jealous. In this
                  species of liberality no nation can be exceeded by the Arikaras, who flocked down
                  every evening with their wives, sisters, and daughters, each anxious to meet with
                  a market for them."<ref target="n0375" n="75"/>
               </p>
               <p> Interest in sex with strangers was based on three distinct cultural sanctions.
                  The Arikara villagers were eager to obtain European goods, and having sexual
                  relations with traders meant receiving those objects in payment for favors.
                  Ironware, paint, blue beads, and cloth were all part of the exchange. Arikara
                  women demanded and got high prices for their services. As Bradbury testified, "I
                  observed several instances wherein the squaw was consulted by her husband as to
                  the <hi rend="italic">quantum sufficit</hi> of price, a mark of consideration
                  which, from some knowledge of Indians, and the estimation in which their women are
                  held, I had not expected."<ref target="n0376" n="76"/> But having sexual relations
                  with a trader provided more than a supply of scarce luxury goods. Because they
                  were central figures in the staple food trade with other tribes, Arikara women
                  hoped to forge commercial links with white merchants. Sex, as Lewis and Clark were
                  to discover at Fort Clatsop, was an important way to seal a business
                  arrangement.</p>
               <p> Sex with visitors was also an integral part of northern plains hospitality. When
                  Bradbury visited an Arikara lodge, he found that the welcome included not only a
                  bed but a "bedfellow."<ref target="n0377" n="77"/> As the captains learned during
                  the Teton confrontation, to reject such offers was to court misunderstanding and
                  suspicion. If intercourse with non-Indian males strengthened trade ties and
                  expressed traditional hospitality, it also signified something far more complex in
                  northern plains life. The Arikaras and their neighbors, both villagers and nomads
                  alike, perceived sexual contact as a means of transferring spiritual power from
                  one person to another. The Mandan buffalo-calling ceremony was only the most
                  spectacular example of this belief. In that ritual, women had intercourse with
                  elderly men, taking the seminal skill of old hunters and passing it on to their
                  husbands. Sex became a kind of conduit for power. In the same way, Arikara women
                  sought sex with Europeans as a way to pass the strength and skill of the outsiders
                  on to their mates. As John Ewers has written, the "concept of the transmission of
                  power through sexual intercourse seemed to have played a part in the eagerness of
                  Mandan women to cohabit with white men in the early days of the fur trade."<ref target="n0378" n="78"/> Lewis understood the sense of awe when he wrote, "The
                  Indians believed that these traders were the most powerful persons in the
                     nation."<ref target="n0379" n="79"/> Sex was a means to appropriate that power
                  and place it at their disposal.</p>
               <p> There is little doubt that the men of the expedition found Arikara women
                  attractive. They surely did not agree with Tabeau's charge that Arikara females
                  were "the most ugly and have the advantages of surpassing all the others in
                  slovenliness." One who disagreed was Gass. Writing that the Arikaras were "the
                  most cleanly Indians I have ever seen on this voyage," the sergeant added that
                  village women were "handsome" and "the best looking Indians I have ever seen."
                  Ordway agreed, noting that "some of their women are very handsome and clean." Even
                  Clark, who characterized the Arikaras as "pore and Durtey," recalled to Nicholas
                  Biddle that the "Ricara women [were] better looking than the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>."<ref target="n0380" n="80"/>
               </p>
               <p> In the notebook journals of the expedition, there are only the most oblique
                  references to sexual contact with Arikara women. Clark claimed that Arikara
                  overtures were rejected while the expedition was at the villages but implied that
                  once the party departed on October 12 it was quite a different story. Clark
                  recorded that on the evening of the 12th two young women were sent by an Arikara
                  man "and persisted in their civilities." In his plainest statement about intimate
                  relations with the Arikaras written while the expedition was in progress, Clark
                  noted that the women were "very fond of carressing our men." Clark was less
                  reticent when he answered questions for Nicholas Biddle in 1810. He frankly
                  admitted that the men "by means of interpreters found no difficulty in getting
                  women." He believed that Arikara women were "lecherous" and engaged in sexual
                  adventures "without the husband's knowledge." However, in the same note to Biddle,
                  Clark reported that "the husbands etc. [gave] wives and sisters to strangers."<ref target="n0381" n="81"/> Other travelers observed that Arikara women usually
                  initiatied sexual encounters, and there seems to be little doubt that the men in
                  the expedition accepted the offers.</p>
               <p> The only fully documented case of this involved York. In the Arikaras' eyes, York
                  was the central attraction of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Airguns, gifts, and
                  strange doings with a sextant all paled in significance before York. The black man
                  fascinated Indian adults and terrified their children. York's blackness was viewed
                  by the Arikaras as a sign of special spiritual power, and they appropriately named
                  him "the big Medison." To have sexual contact with York was to get in touch with
                  what seemed awesome spirit forces. On one occasion an Arikara man invited York to
                  his lodge, offered him his wife, and guarded the entrance during the act. When a
                  member of the expedition came looking for York, "the master of the house would not
                  let him in before the affair was finished."<ref target="n0382" n="82"/>
               </p>
               <p> Perhaps the most telling comment on the sexual desires of visitors among the
                  Arikaras came in a conversation that Henry M. Brackenridge reported having with a
                  village chief: " 'I was wondering,' said he, 'whether you white people have any
                  women amongst you.' I assured him in the affirmative. 'Then,' said he, 'why is it
                  that your people are so fond of our women, one might suppose they had never seen
                  any before?' "<ref target="n0383" n="83"/>
               </p>
               <p> Early in the afternoon of October 12, with the talks completed and one of the
                  village chiefs on board, Lewis and Clark left the Grand River settlements. It was
                  a festive departure, with "the fiddle playing and the horns sounding." The days
                  that followed were filled with small incidents that added to the sum of
                  Indian-expedition relations. One of those revealing events took place on October
                  14 when Private John Newman was sentenced to corporal punishment for "mutinous
                  expression." Newman's whipping "allarmed the Indian chief very much." Virtually
                  all native American cultures rejected public physical punishment of either
                  children or adults, believing that confomrity to social norms might be better
                  achieved by more subtle group pressure. As the expedition moved toward its Mandan
                  wintering quarters, there was time to record additional bits of ethnographic data.
                  Clark noted an Arikara stone monument surrounded by votive offerings. At another
                  time Clark and the Arikara chief walked along the shore as the Indian recounted "a
                  number of their traditions about turtles, snakes, etc. and the power of a
                  particular rock or cove on the next river which informs of every thing." Sadly for
                  the ethnographic record, Clark believed that "none of those I think worth
                     mentioning."<ref target="n0384" n="84"/>
               </p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> As Lewis and Clark headed toward the Mandan villages, they left behind with the
                  Arikaras a strange set of impressions. Although the villagers had been acquainted
                  with whites for some time, they had never seen such a large group of visitors. The
                  intentions and behavior of the captains, their technology, and the presence of
                  York all produced a vivid folklore. Tabeau, who dutifully recorded some of the
                  tales, found himself in "a bad scrape by treating them as ridiculous." Kakawita,
                  Tabeau's leading Arikara informant, reported what was widely believed among the
                  Arikaras about the Lewis and Clark expedition. In their opinion, the explorers
                  were on a special vision quest and had met "obstacles perhaps invincible" on their
                  journey. One of those obstacles was reputed to be an awesome beast without a mouth
                  who ate by "breathing the smoke of the meat through the nose." Even more terrible,
                  related the Arikara storytellers, was "a troop of Amazons who kill all their male
                  children, pulverize their genitals and conceive again by the injection of the
                  powder obtained." Just how the expedition overcame those monsters is not part of
                  the surviving record. What finally impressed the Arikaras were the objects carried
                  by the expedition. The sextant, the magnet, and phosphorous were talked about as
                  evidence of the captains' spirit powers. And, of course, there was York. As Tabeau
                  wrote, "The most marvelous was, though, a large fine man, black as a bear who
                  spoke and acted as one."<ref target="n0385" n="85"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's party carried away from their time with the Arikaras many
                  personal memories of the sort not readily committed to the pages of diaries or
                  official reports. There can be no doubt that after the tense days with the Tetons,
                  the relaxed hospitality of the Arikaras was a welcome change. It remained for
                  Clark to record his impressions of the Grand River villagers. Of the people, he
                  wrote, "They appear to be peaceful, their men tall and perpotiend, women Small and
                  industerous." Recalling their hospitality, he described the Arikaras as "Durtey,
                  Kind, pore and extravigent." Clark's expressive word <hi rend="italic">extravigent</hi> was his way of drawing attention to the Arikaras' generosity
                  with food and favors. Pleased to give gifts, the Arikaras took "what was offered
                  with great pleasure."<ref target="n0386" n="86"/>
               </p>
               <p> There was much about Arikara culture that the captains either did not understand
                  or did not see. Politics, sacred bundles, band organization, and the yearly round
                  of ritual and ceremony all eluded the explorers. What the expedition's journalists
                  did record was the exterior of Arikara life—an exterior of substantial earth
                  lodges, well-tended fields, and friendly people. American frontiersmen, who valued
                  a secure house and good crops, found much to admire during their time with the
                  Star-rah-he. </p>

               <p> As the fall days of 1804 grew colder and shorter, the Lewis and Clark expedition
                  struggled toward what has been called "the keystone of the Upper Missouri
                  region"—the Mandan and Hidatsa villages.<ref target="n0401" n="1"/> The
                  American explorers were only the latest in a long series of traders and travelers
                  making the journey to the earth lodge villages along the Missouri. The Mandan and
                  Hidatsa towns were the center of northern plains trade, attracting Indian and
                  white merchants over vast distances. At trading times, especially during the late
                  summer and early fall, the villages were crowded with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"

                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, Kiowas, Arapahoes, and, after midcentury, with whites
                  representing the North West Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and St. Louis
                  interests. In the arena of frontier culture, few places gave more evidence of the
                  varied objects and diverse peoples making up North America than the Mandan and
                  Hidatsa towns. The winter at Fort Mandan would expose Lewis and Clark to much of
                  that variety and diversity. The winter would try the expedition's diplomatic skill
                  and expand its ethnographic horizons. At the same time, the Mandan and Hidatsa
                  people would get their first long look at the coming wave of American traders and
                  bureaucrats. Those long Dakota months were an apprenticeship during which each
                  group probed the other and formed lasting impressions.</p>
               <p> A traveler coming up the Missouri from St. Louis in 1804 would have found five
                  Indian settlements—two Mandan and three Hidatsa—strung out along the
                  river in what is now central North Dakota. Past the Heart River, the first town
                  was the Mandan village known to Lewis and Clark as Matootonha. More correctly
                  named Mitutanka, this village was located on the west bank of the Missouri. Clark
                  described Mitutanka as "situated on an eminance of about 50 feet above the water
                  in a handsome plain."<ref target="n0402" n="2"/> Like its sister village across
                  the river, Mitutanka was built by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> sometime around 1787. In most of their notes, the explorers
                  referred to Mitutanka as the "lower" or "first" Mandan village. Ordway reported
                  that the village had about forty earth lodges. Because Mitutanka was the closest
                  Mandan village to the expedition's winter quarters, the explorers became very
                  familiar with both the town and its leading chiefs. Sheheke, known to Lewis and
                  Clark as Big White, was the most prominent civil chief in Mitutanka. The captains
                  named Kagohhami, or Little Raven, also a civil chief, as Second Chief.</p>
               <p> Farther up the Missouri, directly north of Mitutanka and on the east bank of the
                  river, was the second Mandan settlement. Throughout the expedition's records this
                  town of about forty or fifty earth lodges was called Rooptahee. Rooptahee was a
                  mispronunciation of Nuptadi, one of the four Mandan subtribes existing before the
                  1781 smallpox epidemic. Lewis and Clark often called Rooptahee the "upper" or
                  "second" Mandan village. Because it was the home of Posecopsahe, or Black Cat, the
                  civil chief designated Grand Mandan Chief by the explorers, Rooptahee took on
                  special significance for the expedition's diplomacy. Cargarnomakshe, or Raven Man
                  Chief, was made Second Chief of Rooptahee by the captains.</p>
               <p> Directly across the Missouri from Rooptahee was a Hidatsa village so distinct
                  from the two other Hidatsa towns that virtually every European visitor noted the
                  differences. Known as Mahawha, the village was established about 1787 by the
                  Awaxawi Hidatsas. Built on a terrace overlooking the confluence of the Knife and
                  the Missouri rivers, Mahawha had about fifty warriors in 1804. The captains knew
                  these people as the Amahami, Ahaharway, or Wattasoon Indians and always
                  distinguished them in their records from the two other Hidatsa groups. Although
                  the Awaxawis were linguistically distinct from their Hidatsa neighbors on the
                  Knife River, they were not a separate tribe as Lewis and Clark believed. The
                  Awaxawis called themselves Ahaharways or Ahnahaways; Wattasoon was their Mandan
                  name. French traders nicknamed them the "soulier" Indians and Lewis and Clark
                  occasionally termed the Awaxawis as the Shoe or Moccasin people. The captains had
                  some contact with the Awaxawi Hidatsas of Mahawha through Tatuckcopinreha, or
                  White Buffalo Robe Unfolded, the most prominent village chief.</p>
               <p> Along the Knife River, Lewis and Clark found the two major Hidatsa settlements.
                  On the right bank of the Knife, about a mile from the confluence of the Missouri,
                  was the town Lewis and Clark called the "First Minnetaree Village," or "the little
                  village of the Menitarras." Built about 1787 by Awatixa Hidatsas and home to a
                  substantial number of Mandan families as well, the village was properly known as
                  Metaharta. Village residents were sometimes named in expedition journals as
                  Minnetarees Metaharta or the Minnetarees of the Willows. Metaharta has special
                  significance for the history of the expedition since it was there that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> woman Sacagawea and the North West Company trader Toussaint
                  Charbonneau lived before joining the Corps of Discovery. Leadership in the
                  village, as recognized by Lewis and Clark, came from First Chief Ompsehara, or
                  Black Moccasin, and Second Chief Ohharh, or Little Fox. Metaharta would continue
                  to be an important Hidatsa village of some forty lodges until its destruction,
                  along with Mahawha's, by a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> raid in the spring of 1834.</p>
               <p> The most remote of the Knife River Hidatsa villages, both in terms of distance
                  and expeditionary diplomacy, was Menetarra, generally known in the journals as the
                  "second Minnetaree Village." Established sometime before 1780 by the
                  Hidatsas-proper, Menetarra was the largest of the Hidatsa towns, boasting some 450
                  warriors and 130 earth lodges during the Lewis and Clark era. Menetarra's assets
                  were not only substantial population and considerable military force but
                  exceptional leadership in the person of Le Borgne, or One Eye.<ref target="n0403" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p> Observing Mandan and Hidatsa villages during the summer of 1806, Alexander Henry
                  the Younger described them as "a cluster of molehills or muskrat cabins." The
                  trader explained that on closer examination "the nearly circular huts are placed
                  very irregularly; some so close to each other as scarcely to leave a foot-passage,
                  others again at a distance of 20 to 30 feet apart. But about the center of each
                  village is an open space of about four acres, around which the huts are regularly
                  built at equal distances, fronting the open space."<ref target="n0404" n="4"/> For
                  both Mandan and Hidatsa households the village was the focus of important
                  political, economic, and ceremonial activities. In many ways the villages can be
                  best understood as a collection of households all acting together to advance the
                  welfare of the family, the clan, and the village.</p>
               <p> Just as the medicine lodge was the focal point for Arikara villages, the center
                  of a Mandan village was the sacred cedar post and the open plaza around it. The
                  cedar post represented Lone Man, the primary Mandan culture hero. On the north
                  edge of the plaza was the large medicine or Okipa lodge. Hanging on poles outside
                  the Okipa lodge were effigies representing various spirits. The Mandan villages
                  seen by Lewis and Clark consisted of about forty to fifty domestic lodges arranged
                  around the plaza. The social position of each household determined the location of
                  lodges. Those families with important ceremonial responsibilities and those who
                  owned powerful bundles lived near the plaza while less prominent households
                  occupied lodges farther away. Mandan and Hidatsa earth lodges were usually
                  occupied for anywhere between seven to twelve years. Each lodge housed from five
                  to sixteen persons with the average number in a Mandan lodge being ten
                     persons.<ref target="n0405" n="5"/> At the time of Lewis and Clark, Mandan and
                  Hidatsa villages were defended by log palisades.</p>
               <p> These villages, so familiar from the descriptions of explorers and traders like
                  Lewis and Clark and Alexander Henry the Younger and nineteenth-century artists
                  like George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, were in fact only part of the settled
                  experience of the Upper Missouri villagers. They divided their time between large,
                  permanent summer lodge towns and smaller winter camps. The winter lodges, built in
                  wooded bottoms to escape the harsh winter storms, were neither large nor
                  especially well constructed. Lewis and Clark did not comment on these winter
                  camps, and it is possible that fear of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> attack kept many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas within the protection of the more substantial
                  summer villages. Looking down on the towns from a high riverbank, David Thompson
                  was reminded of "so many large hives clustered together."<ref target="n0406" n="6"/> And so must they have seemed to Lewis and Clark seven years later.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark were not the first white men to see the Mandan and Hidatsa
                  villages and their surrounding fields of corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. The
                  first recorded European visit to the villages had occurred on the afternoon of
                  December 3, 1738, when Pierre Gaultier de Varennes de La Vérendrye,
                  accompanied by French traders and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> guides, entered a Mandan "fort" near the Heart
                  River. Attracted by tales of fair-skinned, red-haired natives who lived in large
                  towns and possessed precious metals, La Vérendrye had made the long journey
                  from Fort La Reine on the Assiniboine River to see those mysterious people.
                  Although La Vérendrye did not find the fabled white Indians, he did record
                  the first European impressions of the Mandan lifeway. That record, taken along
                  with evidence preserved from the 1742–43 visit of La Vérendrye's sons
                  to the region, offers the picture of prosperous earth lodge people living along
                  the Missouri River near the Heart and already enjoying French and Spanish
                     goods.<ref target="n0407" n="7"/>

               <p> With the disruptions caused by French and English conflicts that finally cost
                  France its Canadian empire, the tenuous foreign contacts with the Mandan villages
                  were lost, at least to the written record. There is no doubt that European goods
                  continued to enter the Upper Missouri carried by native middlemen. In the second
                  half of the eighteenth century, some Canadians were beginning to reside in the
                  village as "tenant traders." These were men like the little-known Montreal trader
                  Mackintosh, who visited the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> in late 1773, and the long-term residence Pierre Menard, who
                  came in 1778. Mackintosh and Menard were among the last to see the Upper Missouri
                  village Indians in the days of high prosperity before the devastating epidemic of
                  1781. In the years after 1781, weakened by disease and threatened by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> abandoned the Heart River villages. Their move north was toward
                  the Knife River and an uneasy alliance with the Hidatsas. It was there that James
                  Mackay found them when he came from the Qu'Appelle River to trade in 1787.
                  Throughout the 1790s, contacts with both Canadian and St. Louis traders increased
                  as men like Jacques D'Eglise, René Jusseaume, and John Evans waged economic
                  war to gain control of the Mandan-Hidatsa trade. The presence of these men and
                  their goods did not immediately threaten the well-being of the villagers. Quite
                  the contrary, the trade items (especially guns and ammunition) strengthened the
                  villagers against their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara enemies. The traders were simply adopted as fictional
                  relatives, a practice first noted by La Vérendrye and surely employed long
                  before 1738 with Indian middlemen.<ref target="n0408" n="8"/>
               </p>
               <p> The Mandan and Hidatsa villages have been aptly described as "the central market
                  place of the Northern Plains."<ref target="n0409" n="9"/> It was this great
                  Missouri River country store that attracted so many Europeans, as well as Indians.
                  The transactions at this crossroads of cultures and goods touched the lives of
                  people far from central North Dakota and in turn conditioned the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>' and the Hidatsas' relations with all outsiders. At that market
                  one could find Spanish horses and mules brought by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, destined for <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> herds; fancy <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> leather clothing for Mandan dandies; English trade guns and
                  ammunition eagerly sought by villagers and nomads alike; and the ever present
                  baskets of corn, beans, squash, and tobacco upon which Mandan and Hidatsa economic
                  strength was built. Forming the upper exchange center in the Missouri Trade
                  System, the Mandan and Hidatsa villagers served as brokers in an international
                  economic and cultural trade network that faced in three directions and stretched
                  over thousands of miles.</p>
               <p> Like their Arikara neighbors, the Mandan and Hidatsa villages shared an important
                  western connection with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref>, and Arapahoes. These nomadic plains people brought a wide variety
                  of meat products as well as luxury leather goods to the Mandan-Hidatsa market. But
                  in the eyes of all villagers, the most valuable commodity brought from the West
                  and Southwest were horses and mules. Just as the Arikaras sought those animals to
                  supply the needs of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, so did Mandan and Hidatsa traders bargain for them to satisfy
                  the requirements of their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> and Cree customers. Reaching east, the Knife River
                  brokers also did some trading with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands who brought buffalo meat and some manufactured goods from
                  the Dakota Rendezvous. However, the close trade ties between the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and the Arikaras and the frequent raids that alliance visited on
                  the Mandan and Hidatsa towns made the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> connection somewhat risky.</p>
               <p> If the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> could not be relied upon to bring European goods to the
                  Knife River villages as they did to the Grand River towns, the Mandan and Hidatsa
                  people had to find another and more reliable source of supply. So the third face
                  of the Mandan-Hidatsa system looked north to the many bands of Crees and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>. Long before Lewis and Clark, the Crees and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> had been carrying English and French goods to the
                  Mandan and Hidatsa towns to exchange for agricultural produce, tobacco, and
                  horses. When La Vérendrye visited the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> in 1738, he saw the Mandan-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> trade in full swing. The French explorer,
                  impressed with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>' business skill, wrote that the villagers "knew well how to
                  profit by it in selling their grains, tobacco, skins and colored plumes which they
                  knew the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> prize highly." As testimony to the penetration of
                  European goods into the northern plains well before the middle of the eighteenth
                  century, La Vérendrye observed that the most sought-after merchandise brought
                  by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> were "guns, axes, kettles, powder, bullets,
                  knives, [and] awls."<ref target="n0410" n="10"/>
               </p>
               <p> Whenever Lewis and Clark analyzed an Indian trade system, they always thought in
                  terms of the distribution of political power in that network and possible future
                  competition with American merchants. Regarding the Missouri Trade System, they
                  believed that the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> needed to be weaned away from North West Company traders and
                  brought into the sphere of the St. Louis interests. Beyond that, Lewis and Clark
                  were always eager to cast the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> as colonial masters exercising political and economic dominance
                  over the innocent and vulnerable Arikaras. The message was simple. The political
                  and economic power of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> needed to be broken and the honest villagers freed so that they
                  could participate in the new American trade system.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's diplomacy attempted to impose the same simplistic model on the
                  Mandan and Hidatsa trade with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> and Crees. Those tribes provided manufactured
                  goods from English and Canadian sources that might be supplied by American
                  merchants. Knowing there was often tension between the villagers and their
                  northern trading partners, Lewis and Clark used such strife as a pretext to
                  lecture Mandan chiefs on the reasons for abandoning the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> and Crees in favor of St. Louis traders. What the
                  captains did not grasp was that the merchandise exchanged between the villagers
                  and the northern peoples—food products and horses—did not in the least
                  interest Americans increasingly obsessed with beaver pelts. Despite this, Clark
                  still told Mandan chiefs, "You know yourselves that you are compelled to put up
                  with little insults from the Christinoes [Cree] and Ossinaboins because if you go
                  to war with those people, they will prevent the traders in the North from bringing
                  you guns, powder, and ball and by that means distress you very much." Clark was
                  determined to cast the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and the Hidatsas in the same role as the Arikaras with the new
                  oppressors as <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> and Crees. If the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were the masters lower down the river, Lewis and Clark seemed
                  prepared to brand the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> as "great rogues" from the north.<ref target="n0411" n="11"/> Just as the captains had misunderstood Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> relations much to the detriment of the expedition's Indian
                  diplomacy, so they failed to appreciate both the ability of the villagers to cope
                  with the northern nomads and the essential equality of the trade arrangement.
                  Because he saw actual trade bargains made between the two parties, La
                  Vérendrye better understood the operation of the system. "The Mandan," he
                  wrote, "are much more crafty than the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> in their commerce and in everything, and always
                  dupe them." He called the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> "sharp traders, [who] clean the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> out of everything they have in the way of guns,
                  powder, ball, kettles, axes, knives, and awls."<ref target="n0412" n="12"/> If the
                  captains seriously entertained the notion that the villager-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> link could be broken, they did not account for the
                  trading abilities and needs of either party.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> Toward the end of October 1804, as the expedition passed the Cannonball River,
                  the explorers began to notice abandoned Mandan villages. On October 19, the
                  captains saw the ruins of a sturdy Mandan settlement on a hill some ninety feet
                  above the river. In the days that followed, as the American party passed through
                  the old Mandan homeland around the Heart River, there were even more signs of
                  village life before the epidemic scourges of the 1780s and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-Arikara attacks forced a northward flight toward the Knife. A
                  Mandan sun dance post standing alone on the prairie was a silent witness to the
                  past. Among the mounds and empty lodges of abandoned villages, the Americans found
                  the scattered bones of both men and animals—grim reminders of the
                  devastation of earlier days.<ref target="n0413" n="13"/>
               </p>
               <p> Faced with these unsettling artifacts of a troubled past, there must have been a
                  certain measure of relief among the explorers when, on October 24, they
                  encountered the first live Mandan Indians seen by the expedition. As the captains
                  passed an island in the Missouri, they came upon a Mandan chief on a fall hunt.
                  Because one of their central diplomatic objectives was to promote an alliance of
                  all Missouri River villagers against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, Lewis and Clark were anxious to foster peace between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, Hidatsas, and the Arikaras. The captains were sure they had
                  moved one step closer to that goal when the Mandan chief and the Arikara chief
                  traveling with them met "with great Cordiallity and serimony." After smoking a
                  pipe together, Lewis and Gravelines went with the Mandan chief to his lodge. When
                  Lewis and the group returned, "We admitted the Grand Chief and his brother for a
                  few minits on our boat." Ordway added his unofficial seal of approval to the day
                  by observing that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> "had Some handsome women with them." As the expedition camped
                  that night below an old Mandan-Arikara town, all signs pointed toward friendly
                  relations on several levels.<ref target="n0414" n="14"/>
               </p>
               <p> Expeditionary diplomacy, as well as personal expectations about those "handsome
                  women," was slowed the next day as progress upriver became more difficult. As the
                  Missouri twisted its way north beyond present-day Bismarck, North Dakota, its
                  channel became choked with sandbars and hard to find. While the men struggled
                  throughout the day with the heavy keelboat, more and more <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> came to the riverbank to watch what must have seemed an
                  outlandish spectacle. Clark described the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> as sightseers intent on "satisfying their Curiossities as to
                  our appearance, etc." As the day wore on, knots of Indians called the Americans to
                  come ashore and talk. The demands of the river gave little time for such rest
                  stops, but Clark did take note of more vacant Mandan villages and "a large and
                  extensive bottom for several miles in which the squars raised their corn."
                  Sometime during the day the captains also heard a bit of news that further
                  verified their bad opinion of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"

                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors had recently stolen some Hidatsa horses and on the way
                  home from the raid had fallen in with an <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> band. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> had been killed by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>, an incident reenforcing the image of plains
                  nomads as hostile and unpredictable. When several <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> came to camp, Clark had his first opportunity to study the
                  villagers. His first impressions were favorable and he wrote, "Those Indians
                  appear to have similar customs with the Ricaras, they dress the same, [and are]
                  more mile in their language and justurs."<ref target="n0415" n="15"/>
               </p>
               <p> As the Lewis and Clark flotilla neared the Mandan and Hidatsa villages, the pace
                  of the expedition's activity increased. There were all sorts of problems that
                  called for the captains' attention and most of those questions involved relations
                  with the Indians. The Americans needed to prepare for full-scale talks with Mandan
                  and Hidatsa chiefs, a prospect that required careful thought, reliable
                  interpreters, and plenty of gifts. The delicate truce proposed between the
                  Arikaras, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, and Hidatsas had to be accepted by the Knife River
                  chiefs and perhaps solidified with some cooperative show of force against the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. And there was the presence of Canadian and English traders on
                  the Upper Missouri. These men, none of whom were American citizens, posed a unique
                  challenge to Lewis and Clark's Indian diplomacy. Were they to be allowed to
                  continue trading with the Indians, thereby undercutting St. Louis ventures, or
                  were they to be expelled, perhaps with a show of force? In the confused days
                  immediately after the Louisiana Purchase, the status of those foreign traders was
                  unclear. Lewis and Clark would have to tread carefully, watching the words and
                  actions of both Indians and traders, gathering valuable information but alienating
                  no one. American sovereignty had to be proclaimed but not so stridently as to
                  frighten Indian trading partners. Finally, and of no little concern, a suitable
                  location for winter quarters had to be found.</p>
               <p> Plans to resolve those questions began to take shape on the evening of October
                  26, when the Americans camped in a fallow cornfield just below Mitutanka. Earlier
                  in the day, the captains had accepted two Mandan chiefs and their household goods
                  as temporary keelboat passengers. Now as the whole party made camp, they were
                  joined by scores of Mandan men, women and children who clustered around the
                  expedition's gear. Poking and probing all the strange objects, the Indians seemed
                  especially attracted to the corn mill. Because Clark was still suffering from a
                  persistent rheumatic complaint and both men were unsure of their reception by the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, Lewis alone joined the chiefs in making the short
                  walk to Mitutanka. Fears of an unfriendly reception were quickly allayed when
                  Lewis was given a warm welcome. Ordway's cryptic "found the nation very friendly"
                  masks the real concern the expedition had about relations with the villagers. At
                  this early stage perhaps neither the chiefs nor the captains were quite ready to
                  pass final judgment on each other. But it was an encouraging sign of Mandan
                  friendship when the chiefs came back to the expedition's camp later in the evening
                  and smoked with Clark.<ref target="n0416" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p> That first evening of talking and smoking was important preparation for the days
                  to come but it was, after all, only the beginning. Contact had been made with only
                  one Mandan village. With much left to do, the expedition continued to make
                  measured progress upriver on the following day. Saturday proved to be a day filled
                  with informal visits to both Mandan villages, considerable socializing, and an
                  important meeting with the trader René Jusseaume.</p>
               <p> Leaving camp early on Saturday morning, the expedition made its first stop at
                  Mitutanka. Clark hiked up the fifty-foot terrace to the stockaded town, noting as
                  he went the earth lodges with many horses tethered outside. Once in the village,
                  the explorer was greeted by several chiefs. Although Clark did not record which
                  chiefs were present, it is most likely that he met Sheheke and perhaps Little
                  Raven, the Second Chief. After smoking, Clark was invited to remain at the village
                  for some food. Anxious to impress their powerful visitor and perhaps make a
                  valuable trade connection, the Mitutanka chiefs were very displeased when Clark
                  rejected their offer of corn and beans. That displeasure was eventually dispelled
                  when the captain explained that he felt "indisposed" and was not prepared to take
                  on the Mandan menu.</p>
               <p> Perhaps the most important event during the two-hour visit at Mitutanka was the
                  meeting with René Jusseaume. A free trader with ties to the North West
                  Company, Jusseaume had been living among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> for some fifteen years and spoke their language fluently. Few
                  whites could match Jusseaume's knowledge and experience on the Upper Missouri.
                  Many fellow traders did not like the Frenchman, including Alexander Henry the
                  Younger, who described him as a man whose ways were "much worse than those of a
                  Mandane." The dour Henry asserted that Jusseaume was "possessed of every
                  superstition natural to those people, nor is he different in every mean, dirty
                  trick they have acquired from intercourse with the set of scoundrels who visit
                  these parts." Although Lewis and Clark were eager to hire Jusseaume as an
                  interpreter and informant on Upper Missouri life, they had an equally low opinion
                  of him. Later that evening, after Jusseaume told Clark that he had once served the
                  elder Clark as a scout in the Illinois country during the Revolution, the explorer
                  described him as "a cunin artful an insonce [insolent] ar—[?]."<ref target="n0417" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> His visit at Mitutanka over, Clark returned to the river. As the expedition
                  passed the Nuptadi village called Rooptahee, the banks were lined with Mandan
                  children intent on not missing a single move made by the white strangers. Opposite
                  the Hidatsa village of Mahawha, the keelboat and pirogues were anchored and camp
                  was established. Lewis then took an interpreter, perhaps Jusseaume, and paid a
                  courtesy call at Rooptahee. Most of the men who were out hunting had now returned,
                  and Lewis spent an hour talking with the village leaders Black Cat and Raven Man
                  Chief.</p>
               <p> With the Mandan villages all properly visited, Lewis and Clark now turned their
                  attention to preparing for the important council planned for October 28. The three
                  Hidatsa villages had not yet been invited, and it was imperative that they be part
                  of any negotiations. The captains selected three runners, perhaps young Mandan
                  warriors, to carry carrots of tobacco to the Hidatsa towns to symbolize the
                  Americans' cordial wish to talk. Erecting a flag pole, checking the supply of
                  gifts, and sending invitations were only part of the preparations made that night.
                  There was the pressing matter of political intelligence. Lewis and Clark needed to
                  know the names of the Mandan and Hidatsa chiefs and prominent men, as well as
                  something of the way they might respond to the proposals offered by the captains.
                  For all their dislike of Jusseaume, it was to him that Lewis and Clark turned for
                  "some information of the chiefs of the different nations." Jusseaume's thorough
                  knowledge of village politics is reflected in the complete list of Indian notables
                  Clark composed on October 29. With all these matters in hand, the expedition
                  welcomed overnight Mandan visitors and bedded down for another night along the
                     Missouri.<ref target="n0418" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p> The grand council bringing together Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, and United States
                  representatives was to take place on Sunday, October 28, 1804. Ordway described
                  the level flood plain across the river from Mahawha as "the most convenient place
                  to hold a council with the whole nation." By midmorning Hidatsas representing all
                  three villages began to gather at the conference ground. Everything seemed in
                  order before noon except the weather. Just as high winds had delayed talks with
                  the Arikaras, so now a strong gale from the Southwest turned the captains' plans
                  upside down. Blowing sand picked up by the fierce wind stung everyone's face, and
                  the Missouri became so rough that Sheheke and the other Mitutanka chiefs could not
                  cross to the meeting site.</p>
               <p> Their plans gone awry, the captains spent the day entertaining the chiefs who
                  were already there. Tours of the keelboat were conducted for the visiting
                  dignitaries, who promptly pronounced it and York to be "great medicine." Lewis,
                  Clark, the Mandan chief Black Cat, and an interpreter then walked about a mile and
                  a half up the Missouri looking for a good location for the future Fort Mandan.
                  Although many places seemed promising, all lacked sufficient supplies of timber.
                  The captains also used their time with the Mandan chief to ask him about
                  leadership in the five villages. Black Cat, whom Lewis and Clark came to rely on
                  more and more during the winter, provided the names of twelve prominent chiefs to
                  flesh out the information obtained from Jusseaume. There was also time for some
                  friendly gift giving. Several women brought corn and boiled hominy; Clark
                  responded by offering a large glazed earthenware jar to Black Cat's wife, "who
                  receved it with much pleasure." Other members of the expedition indulged in some
                  sightseeing. Ordway poked around Rooptahee, noting the design of the village and
                  marveling at the way Mandan corpses were arranged on scaffolds outside the town.
                  George Drouillard, who had caught two beavers the night before, probably did some
                  more pelt hunting.<ref target="n0419" n="19"/> Hoping that the weather on Monday
                  would be more favorable, the explorers again made their diplomatic arrangements.
                  The Hidatsa chiefs were asked to smoke with Black Cat and remain in his village
                  until the next day. Despite these delays, Lewis and Clark were confident that they
                  could persuade the Indian delegates to accept what might be called "the American
                  Plan."</p>
               <p> As Lewis and Clark entered the crucial talks, they had several objectives in
                  mind. Some were the same as those pursued in meetings with Indians lower down the
                  river while others were unique to the Mandan-Hidatsa situation on the Upper
                  Missouri. Of the goals that represented a continuity with earlier Indian
                  conferences, two must have seemed especially important to the explorer-diplomats
                  that Sunday evening. First, there was the vital matter of announcing American
                  sovereignty over lands of the Louisiana Purchase. As they had done before, Lewis
                  and Clark were anxious to impress on the minds of "dutiful Indian children" that
                  they had a new and powerful father in a distant place. But sovereignty meant more
                  than simply proclaiming Thomas Jefferson as the new Indian father. If American
                  influence was to be substance and not shadow, men like Black Cat and Sheheke had
                  to be made willing agents of United States policy. The second goal was closely
                  tied to the first. American policy toward the Indians linked trade with
                  sovereignty. Proclaiming ownership of new territories meant little unless some
                  economic good would come from them. Everything that Lewis and Clark had seen so
                  far indicated the rich possibilities for St. Louis-based traders. That trade could
                  serve many purposes. Strengthening American influence while reducing the power of
                  British agents was not the least of the captains' concerns. Lewis and Clark never
                  thought that trade followed the flag. They assumed that sovereignty and business
                  enterprise marched as one.</p>
               <p> Commerce and nationalism were certainly important objectives to be pursued in the
                  Mandan-Hidatsa talks. But what now captured most of the captains' attention was a
                  plan whose outlines had been forming from the earliest days of the expedition. As
                  Lewis and Clark saw it, the various <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands, but especially the Teton, were the most dangerous and
                  disruptive force on the Missouri. After spending some time on the Upper Missouri,
                  the explorers were ready to add the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> to the list of hostile tribes. For Lewis and
                  Clark, the response to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> challenge was the creation of a villager alliance
                  against the plains nomads. Such an alliance would strengthen, so thought the
                  captains, the power of the earth lodge people so that they could more fully
                  participate in the American trade system. At the same time, such an alliance might
                  force the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> to abandon their British suppliers and join the
                  American traders. The vital first step in forging such a villager alliance had
                  been taken when Lewis and Clark convinced some Arikara chiefs to make peace with
                  the Mandan and Hidatsa towns. As the captains entered the Mandan-Hidatsa
                  conference, they still believed that a few words, a bit of military pomp, and some
                  gifts could rearrange tribal politics to suit American interests.</p>
               <p> The weather on the morning of October 29 did not bode well for the sort of
                  meeting the explorers had in mind. Lewis wrote, "The winds was so hard that it was
                  extreemely disagreeable, the Sands was blown on us in clouds."<ref target="n0420" n="20"/> Fearing that further delays might permanently damage their prospects
                  for success, Lewis and Clark decided to proceed with the gathering. To shield the
                  participants from the nasty weather, the captains ordered an awning put up and
                  pieces of sail cloth stretched between stakes to block the wind and flying
                  sand.</p>
               <p> By midmorning all seemed in order, and at eleven o'clock the bow swivel gun on
                  the keelboat was fired to signal the start of the meeting. Expeditionary records
                  do not make it clear how many Mandan and Hidatsa chiefs were present. It is
                  certain that Le Borgne, the powerful Hidatsa-proper chief, was not present, nor
                  was Sheheke. Those who did attend included Black Cat and the important
                  Hidatsa-proper chief Caltarcota. Lewis began the session by giving a long speech
                  interpreted through Jusseaume, "the Substance of which [was] Similer to what we
                  had Delivered to the nations below." That stock speech stressed the themes of
                  United States sovereignty, American trade, and intertribal peace. Such proposals
                  did not seem novel to the captains, but they did amount to substantial changes in
                  the ways the five Mandan and Hidatsa villages did business with both native and
                  white outsiders. Even before Lewis introduced the touchy matter of peace with the
                  Arikaras and a villager alliance against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, there were signs of displeasure. The most visible one came from
                  Caltarcota. Although he had given up much formal power to Le Borgne, Caltarcota
                  retained considerable influence among the Hidatsas-proper. As Lewis spoke, the
                  chief became increasingly restless and finally seemed ready to leave the council.
                  When questioned, Caltarcota excused his unhappy reaction to the American proposals
                  by claiming that his village stood in imminent danger of attack from unnamed but
                  hostile Indians. One of the chiefs quickly saw through this deception and "rebuked
                  [Caltarcota] for his uneasiness at Such a time as the present." Caltarcota's
                  "uneasiness" was probably a reflection of the close ties Menetarra and the other
                  Hidatsa villages had to English traders, as well as a dislike for outsiders who
                  dared dictate policy to the Hidatsas. But at this point in the proceedings
                  Caltarcota's actions did not seem worrisome and the captains had no reason to
                  think that there would be serious Hidatsa opposition to any part of the American
                  design.</p>
               <p> At the end of the speech, the captains introduced the most controversial element
                  on their diplomatic agenda. The assembled Indians must have known that the Arikara
                  chief sitting in the council was more than window dressing. Now was the time to
                  open the issue of an Arikara peace with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and the Hidatsas as a preliminary to a general villager
                  coalition. The captains did not record the words they used to propose the peace
                  treaty, but what does survive is evidence of a significant gesture. Clark, by now
                  acquainted with the protocol of plains diplomacy, took a pipe, smoked it and
                  passed it to the Arikara chief. That pipe was in turn handed around to the Mandan
                  and Hidatsa representatives. Clark noted later, "They all smoked with eagerness
                  out of the pipe held by the Ricara chief."<ref target="n0421" n="21"/> To
                  demonstrate the importance of the Arikara chief and to enhance his status among
                  the other chiefs, Clark gave him an American dollar coin as a medal, "with which
                  he was much pleased," as well as a certificate verifying his "sincereity and good
                  conduct."</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark did not know until much later that the Mandan chief Big Man had
                  privately blasted the Arikaras as "liars and bad men." Speaking directly to the
                  Arikara chief sometime after the council, Big Man accused the Grand River
                  villagers of treachery in killing Mandan representatives who had earlier sought
                  peace. Whenever there was conflict between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and the Arikaras, the Mandan chief insisted that the
                  instigators were always the Arikaras. But Big Man boasted that in those violent
                  encounters Mandan warriors killed the Arikaras "like the buffalo." With a candor
                  not shown to Lewis and Clark, Big Man said to the Arikara chief, "We will make
                  peace with you as our two fathers have directed, and they shall see that we will
                  not be the Ogressors, but we fear the Ricares will not be at peace long."<ref target="n0422" n="22"/> Lewis and Clark did not hear about the acrimonious
                  exchange until the end of November. Had they known about Mandan reservations
                  earlier, the American diplomats might not have been so sanguine in their
                  expectations.</p>
               <p> Relieved that the peace overture had evidently been well received, Lewis and
                  Clark moved on to the next item—designating chiefs and distributing gifts.
                  As they had done before, the captains were determined to "mint" chiefs whether the
                  American stamp meant anything or not. Indians accepted the uniforms, medals,
                  certificates, and flags as symbols of respect but had no intention of
                  relinquishing political autonomy or cultural identity. Appointing men like Black
                  Cat or Sheheke was essentially a meaningless exercise, but it fulfilled
                  bureaucratic imperative. "With much serimony," the expedition handed out medals,
                  coats, hats, flags, and other goods to those selected to receive American honors.
                  Knowing that Le Borgne was too important to be overlooked even though he was out
                  hunting, the captains gave Caltarcota a suit of clothes for the chief. For the old
                  Hidatsa-proper chief himself, there was a supply of gifts, a flag, and some
                  wampum. Because Lewis and Clark knew so little about the politics of Metaharta and
                  Menetarra, they named no chiefs for those villages but simply listed a number of
                  prominent warriors for the expedition's record. Unlike other earlier Indian
                  conferences that ended with a general distribution of gifts to natives of all
                  sorts and ranks, Lewis and Clark limited their presents to the chiefs and elders.
                  That action caused considerable resentment, since most Indians persisted in
                  viewing the expedition as a trading venture.</p>
               <p> With the conference nearly over, Lewis and Clark asked the Indians for their
                  replies as soon as possible. The proceedings ended as they began with a display of
                  American firepower. Lewis fired his airgun, "which appeared to astonish the
                  natives very much." The council concluded, most of the Indian participants drifted
                  away, perhaps still wondering just what all the high-flown words and gifts really
                  meant.</p>
               <p> But for Lewis and Clark, the day was not yet over. Later that evening the Arikara
                  chief came to Clark with an unwelcome request. The chief was beginning to feel
                  uncomfortable in the company of so many recent enemies and wanted to return
                  immediately to the Grand River villages. With negotiations on the Arikara peace
                  still in progress, his departure could cause delay and suspicion. With a string of
                  wampum and a promise that the talks would be successful, Clark was able to
                  forestall the Arikara's departure. Having done that, Lewis and Clark might have
                  noted how busy the day had been. Indeed, it had been so filled with diplomatic
                  comings and goings that Lewis forgot to wind the expedition's chronometer.<ref target="n0423" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p> If Lewis and Clark expected quick answers to the American proposals, they were to
                  be disappointed. There was no Mandan tribal council; each village had to spend
                  considerable time formulating a response. There was a Hidatsa tribal council,
                  created about 1797 or 1798, but each of the three villages retained virtual
                  autonomy in dealings with powerful outsiders.<ref target="n0424" n="24"/> Despite
                  their experience in earlier negotiations with the Indians, Lewis and Clark still
                  assumed that they were dealing with nation states possessing bureaucratic
                  machinery able to formulate and enforce a single response to a diplomatic
                  proposal. In the three weeks that followed the grand council, the captains got not
                  one answer but many. And they encountered more questions and hostility than
                  expected.</p>
               <p> On the day after the conference, Sheheke and Ohheenar, an adopted <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> living in Mitutanka, came to the expedition's camp. Out
                  hunting the day of the meeting, they were now eager to hear the speeches and share
                  in the honors and gifts. Lewis and Clark offered the Mandan chiefs a synopsis of
                  the American plan and ceremoniously placed a medal around Sheheke's neck. Knowing
                  that they would have to wait a bit longer for responses to their plans, the
                  captains divided the rest of the day between continuing the search for winter
                  quarters and trading with the dozens of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> who were now becoming a regular part of camp life. From the
                  camp opposite Mahawha, Clark took eight men in a pirogue and sailed seven miles up
                  toward the Knife River. On one of the islands in the Missouri, he found a good
                  supply of wood but decided that the site was too distant from the water. Clark was
                  beginning to think that a location lower down the river and closer to the Mandan
                  villages might prove the best choice. Throughout the afternoon the expedition's
                  camp was filled with Indians eager to exchange corn and cornmeal bread for a
                  variety of trade goods. The expedition needed to lay in a substantial store of
                  food for the long winter. These trading days fulfilled that need while furthering
                  good relations between the explorers and their neighbors. As the cool October
                  afternoon slipped into evening, everyone danced and drank, "which pleased the
                  Savages much." And in the twilight there was something else that pleased the
                  captains. Into camp came the Raven, Second Chief at Rooptahee, with an invitation
                  from Black Cat. The Mandan chief wanted to talk, and he promised to give many bags
                  of corn as a sign of good faith. The Raven also said that he was prepared to
                  accompany the Arikara chief back to the Grand River to cement the villager
                  alliance. Lewis and Clark may not have known where to build Fort Mandan, but at
                  least it appeared winter diplomacy was well launched.<ref target="n0425" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> The last day of October 1804 marked the first of the Mandan and Hidatsa's formal
                  replies to the Lewis and Clark diplomatic offensive. Because the captains believed
                  that Black Cat was the single most powerful Mandan chief, they were anxious to
                  know his response. About noon, Clark and Jusseaume walked down to Rooptahee. At
                  the village Clark was welcomed "and with great ceremoney was Seeted on a roabe by
                  the Side of the Chief." Black Cat placed a fine buffalo robe over Clark's
                  shoulders, "and after smoking the pipe with several old men around" Black Cat
                  began to speak.</p>
               <p> His speech was a carefully worded reply to the American proposals—a
                  response designed to reassure Lewis and Clark of Mandan friendship without tying
                  the villages too closely to an uncertain policy. The Mandan chief went directly to
                  the heart of the explorers' plan. Declaring that he believed what the captains
                  said about an end to violence, Black Cat felt certain that a general peace would
                  "not only give him Satisfaction but all his people." The chief graphically
                  illustrated the benefits of such a peace, saying it would mean "they now could
                  hunt without fear, and their womin could work in the fields without looking everry
                  moment for the enemey." The idea of a general Indian peace was fundamental to
                  American policy, but in the case of the Upper Missouri villagers that peace had to
                  be achieved among themselves before it could be widened to include others. Black
                  Cat seemed to indicate that was a real possibility. Pointing to the Raven and
                  several warriors seated nearby, he indicated that these men would accompany the
                  Arikara chief back to his village "to smoke with that people." Saying that the way
                  was now open, Black Cat also showed some interest in going to see the Great Father
                  in Washington.</p>
               <p> If Black Cat had things to say that pleased Lewis and Clark, the Mandan also had
                  complaints. Those complaints were based on the captains' inability to explain the
                  nature of their mission. Previous Indian-white contact had always been within the
                  context of trade. Indians of the region had yet to encounter white soldiers or
                  bureaucrats. The very concept of exploration as an activity apart from war or
                  trade simply made no sense to the Indians. As the expedition went upriver, Lewis
                  and Clark did give away substantial stocks of goods. The rumors that preceded the
                  party stressed that display of wealth and raised expectations that many Indians
                  might share in it. If the captains left behind among the Arikaras a vivid
                  folklore, what went ahead were tales of cloth, beads, and ironware for all. When
                  Lewis and Clark did not immediately distribute gifts in the amounts expected after
                  the first council, there was dissatisfaction. As Black Cat put it plainly, "When
                  you came up the Indians in the neighboring Villages, as well as those out hunting
                  when they heard of you had great expectations of receving presents. Those hunting
                  immediately on hearing returned to the Village and all was Disapointed, and Some
                  Dissatisfied." Black Cat admitted that he was pleased with his gifts but reported
                  that most in Rooptahee expected more.</p>
               <p> The Mandan chief concluded his speech by restoring some stolen French beaver
                  traps whose return had been requested earlier by Lewis and Clark. Two of the traps
                  were laid at Clark's feet, along with twelve bushels of corn and several buffalo
                  robes. After more smoking "in great cerimony," Clark replied to Black Cat's
                  speech. The expedition's record does not contain any hint of what the captain said
                  except that his words "Satisfied them verry much." If Black Cat and his elders
                  seemed "satisfied" with the meeting, Clark also had every reason to be pleased.
                  Black Cat's village appeared ready to smoke in peace with the Arikaras. Complaints
                  about not enough presents seemed inconsequential, and the chief's careful
                  avoidance of criticism of either the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> or the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> did not disturb the confident captains.</p>
               <p> On his way back to the keelboat, Clark met Tatuckcopinreha, chief of Mahawha, and
                  Little Crow, a prominent Mandan and second chief at Mitutanka. Clark invited the
                  two to join him on the boat, where they spent about an hour talking and smoking.
                  Since this was the first official contact the expedition had had with any Hidatsa
                  chief since the grand council, Clark probably hoped that Tatuckcopinreha would
                  respond to at least part of the American proposal. Either the village council had
                  not decided on its answer or the decision was to wait and see what the other
                  villages would do, since all Clark got out of the Mahawha chief were "a fiew words
                  on various subjects not much to the purpose." After some more smoking and a quick
                  airgun demonstration, the Indians left. Clark was plainly disappointed and
                  peevishly wrote, "Those nations know nothing of regular councils and know not how
                  to proceed in them, they are useless."<ref target="n0426" n="26"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although the failure to get any clear statement from Tatuckcopinreha was
                  unfortunate, this first day of gathering Indian reactions was successful from the
                  captains' perspective. And the explorers' mood surely brightened later in the
                  afternoon when Black Cat and two of his sons came parading into camp to show off
                  the fancy clothing given to them the previous day. In high spirits, Black Cat
                  wanted to see the Americans dance to the music of Pierre Cruzatte's fiddle, a
                  request "which they very readily gratified him in." The festive air in camp that
                  night seemed a fitting end to a day in which the expedition edged closer to its
                  diplomatic objectives.<ref target="n0427" n="27"/>
               </p>
               <p> The following day it was Sheheke's turn to speak with the captains. About ten
                  o'clock the Mitutanka chief, accompanied by Big Man and Ohheenar, came into the
                  expedition's camp. Sheheke had two things on his mind, the Arikara peace and the
                  future location of the expedition's winter quarters. The explorers were more
                  interested in the Mandan's response to their proposals; he appeared far more
                  concerned about the site of Fort Mandan. As it turned out, Sheheke was the one who
                  had his priorities in order, at least as far as Mandan needs were concerned. But
                  because the white strangers were so insistent, the chief began with words about
                  peace and the Indian alliance. Sheheke agreed to make peace with the Arikaras and
                  promised to send a delegation down to the Grand River to smoke with his new
                  brothers. But the chief was not about to let Lewis and Clark think that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> were in the past anything other than innocent victims of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara aggression. He maintained that conflict was always
                  instigated by Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> forces. Some years before, a chief sent by the Mandan villages to
                  smoke for peace had been murdered by the faithless Arikaras. Such acts fueled the
                  continued violence and distrust, Sheheke declared. He boasted, "We have killed
                  enough of them. We kill them like birds." But at the same time, Sheheke agreed
                  that perhaps now was the time for a peace. Without making any long-range promises
                  or binding the village to a potentially troublesome ally, Sheheke simply said, "We
                  will make a good peace."</p>
               <p> Those were the words Lewis and Clark wanted to hear. The captains were intent on
                  accomplishing their diplomatic assignments, and obtaining assurances from both
                  Mandan chiefs must have been satisfying. What continued to elude Lewis and Clark
                  was the nature of Upper Missouri tribal and village relations. "A good peace" was
                  not the same as a lasting one, nor was it intended to be. Black Cat and Sheheke
                  were not talking about a fundamental rearrangement of relations between villages
                  or tribes. They certainly had no power to commit <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> to such changes. Sheheke asked simply, "Are you going to stay
                  above or below during this cold season?" The chief's solicitude for American
                  comfort during the winter was more apparent than real. His real concern was to
                  keep the expedition nearby for a regular supply of trade goods and for protection
                  against <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> raids. And there was the always troubled state of
                  Mandan-Hidatsa relations. Sheheke wanted a Fort Mandan, not a Fort Hidatsa. Having
                  the Americans within the orbit of his village would enhance his prestige at the
                  expense of his neighbors. All of this was couched in terms of available food for
                  the winter, Sheheke claiming that it would be easier to supply the expedition's
                  needs if the fort was closer to the Mandan villages. The chief made this plain
                  when he admitted, "We were sorry when we heard of your going up but now you are
                  going down, we are glad." He had made his point, although the captains did not yet
                  know how far the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> would go to keep Hidatsas away from the fort. If the price for
                  having the winter quarters nearby was seeming assent to Lewis and Clark diplomatic
                  proposals, Sheheke thought the cost low enough for gain received.<ref target="n0428" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> In the days that followed, the diplomatic pace slowed. Dropping temperatures,
                  hard frosts, and the first signs of ice on the river were all warnings of the
                  impending plains winter. Indian negotiations now seemed less important than
                  building warm shelter and laying in a good supply of meat and corn. Joseph
                  Whitehouse summed up the expedition's activity in early November by writing that
                  "all the men at Camp Ocepied their time dilligenently in Building their huts and
                  got them Made comfertable in that time to live in."<ref target="n0429" n="29"/> As
                  Fort Mandan slowly took shape, other parts of the company's routine also feel into
                  place. Jusseaume brought his family into the American compound, thereby allowing
                  quicker access to his interpreting skills. The daily visits of Mandan men and
                  women bringing corn, beans, squash, and buffalo meat for trade now became not only
                  a ritual of friendship but an important source of provisions. With the Arikara
                  chief and a Mandan-Hidatsa delegation having left for the Grand River villages on
                  November 2, the captains had every reason to believe they had achieved both good
                  relations with their native neighbors and the goals of Upper Missouri Indian
                  policy. That there were no Hidatsa chiefs in the delegation and that the Hidatsa
                  villages had not replied to the captains' proposals seemed relatively
                  unimportant.</p>
               <p> The predictable rhythm of those busy November days was broken by the arrival of
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> to trade at the Mandan and Hidatsa villages.
                  Jusseaume reported that about fifty lodges of the Little Girl <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> were close at hand. Long before the La
                  Vérendrye era, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> middlemen had made regular journeys to the Upper
                  Missouri to trade with the villagers. Their arrival signaled not only trade but
                  some tension as well, since the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> often tried to enhance their own standing by
                  stealing Mandan and Hidatsa horses. The coming of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> was of special interest to Lewis and Clark. Just
                  as the tributaries of the Missouri might provide St. Louis merchants access to the
                  fur-rich region of the Saskatchewan River, contact with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> Indians might advance American trade prospects.
                  The captains were always concerned with ways to undercut British traders, and
                  although they distrusted the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>, they knew that northern Indians might play an
                  important role in future American plans. If Jefferson's view that the Louisiana
                  Purchase included lands north of the 49th parallel proved valid, ties with the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> would be essential.</p>
               <p> By the middle of November, Jusseaume counted some seventy <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> lodges with a scattering of Crees. All were camped
                  close by, busily preparing to trade with the village folk. Toward evening on
                  November 13, most of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> and Crees joined the villagers at one of the
                  Mandan towns for an adoption dance and ritual "giveaway." These ceremonies allowed
                  customary enemies to become temporary fictional relatives and trade in peace.<ref target="n0430" n="30"/> Because the adoption idea might be used by Americans as
                  a means to enter the intense competition for Upper Missouri trade, Lewis and Clark
                  were interested in recording and analyzing this aspect of plains culture.</p>
               <p> Although the captains were eager to make contact with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>, they were unsure just how to proceed. That
                  uncertainty was resolved when Black Cat obligingly brought the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> band chief Chechank, or the Old Crane, and seven
                  "men of note" to Fort Mandan. Eager to make a good impression on the visitors,
                  Clark offered Chechank a carrot of tobacco "to smoke with his people." Because the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> bands spent most of the year on British soil in
                  what is now Saskatchewan and Manitoba, any official dealings with them would be
                  both awkward and irregular. The captains certainly could not create chiefs, hand
                  out medals and flags, or distribute substantial gifts to those Indians. Clark
                  wisely made a gesture that steered clear of those dangers while still showing
                  American interest and respect for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>. Taking a piece of gold braid, perhaps from a
                  dress uniform, Clark gave it to Chechank "with a view to know him again."<ref target="n0431" n="31"/>
               </p>
               <p> The presence of the expedition and promises to bring American goods from St.
                  Louis had changed the villagers' feelings about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>. As some <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> saw it, manufactured goods could be gotten from another source
                  besides the troublesome <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> middlemen. This potential shift in economic
                  strategy became plain on November 18 when Black Cat made a surprise appearance at
                  Fort Mandan. The chief began his visit by tactfully making "great inquiries
                  respecting our fashions." But it soon became clear that there was more on Black
                  Cat's mind than curiosity about another culture. He revealed that on the previous
                  night there had been a major Mandan council involving chiefs and elders from both
                  villages. In view of the fact that there was no Mandan tribal council, nor even a
                  clear concept of a Mandan tribe, such a meeting was an extraordinary event. The
                  council session had centered on the problems posed by dealing with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>. Some in the council, taking seriously the offer
                  of direct access to metal and textile goods from St. Louis, urged others to no
                  longer trade with the northern Indians. However, that proposal was not well
                  received by most at the assembly. Those who favored an immediate severing of old
                  trade ties and a quick reliance on the Americans were forcefully reminded of
                  lingering ill feelings over John Evans's treatment of them in 1796–97. These
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> claimed that Evans had deceived them and never
                  fulfilled his promise to return and provide them with arms and ammunition. Lewis
                  and Clark, they said, might well do the same. Feelings such as these rightly
                  worried the captains. If so many Mandan chiefs and elders distrusted the
                  Americans, the whole scheme of a villager alliance and a St. Louis trade system
                  might be in jeopardy. But all Lewis and Clark could do was urge the Indians "to
                  remain at peace" and assure them "they might depend upon Getting Supplies through
                  the Channel of the Missourie, but it required time to put the trade in
                     operation."<ref target="n0432" n="32"/> Such soothing words could not take the
                  place of bales of trade goods, nor could they allay the fears expressed in the
                  council. As the expedition settled in for the winter, Mandan doubts about American
                  promises were a discordant note in a tune that had played well so far.</p>
               <p> Two days later, on November 20, there was more unsettling news. No sooner had the
                  captains been forced to confront Mandan discontent than they heard about serious
                  trouble between the Brulé <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and the Arikaras. Because the expedition's Indian policy depended
                  on isolating the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and luring the Arikaras into the American-sponsored coalition,
                  anything that took place between those two Indian groups was of intense concern.
                  Three chiefs from Rooptahee reported that Brulé <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> camped above the Cheyenne River were threatening to attack the
                  Mandan villages during the winter. Even more ominous, the men said that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> had roughed up two Arikara peace emissaries. Anxious to maintain
                  their hold on the Grand River villages, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were plainly "much displeased with the Ricares for making peace
                  with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> etc. through us."<ref target="n0433" n="33"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark were now confronted with a set of grave diplomatic problems. The
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>' acceptance of American economic leadership,
                  seemingly so certain in late October, now appeared uncertain. The Arikara peace
                  mission had been disrupted by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> opposition and now there were open threats of Teton raids during
                  the winter. The entire Lewis and Clark Indian strategy rested on peace between the
                  tribes and a growing acceptance of the villager alliance. It now became plain that
                  the coalition was more imaginary than real. Mandan discontent, possible Arikara
                  defection, and the danger of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> assaults all pointed to yet another nagging and unresolved
                  problem. Since the last days of October, the captains had had no official contact
                  with the Hidatsa villages. Those villages had never replied to the American
                  proposals, nor had they taken any substantial part in the delegation sent to
                  negotiate with the Arikara towns. As these problems began to flood in on the
                  captains, it was essential that talks be opened with leaders at Metaharta and
                  Menetarra.</p>
               <p> Those talks began on November 25, when Meriwether Lewis, René Jusseaume, and
                  Toussaint Charbonneau rode from Fort Mandan to the Hidatsa villages. Six
                  additional members of the expedition took one of the pirogues up to the Knife
                  River. Their destination was Menetarra, largest and most powerful of the Hidatsa
                  settlements. For reasons that are not clear, the American party went directly to
                  the lodge of a Hidatsa chief named the Serpent. Lewis seemed especially interested
                  in talking with another chief named the Horned Weasel. Oddly, there is no record
                  of any attempt to talk with either Le Borgne or Caltarcota. Charles Mackenzie, a
                  North West Company trader living in Metaharta, was told by Lewis that when the
                  Americans attempted to talk with the Horned Weasel they were politely but
                  forcefully rebuffed. The Hidatsa chief let it be known that he was "not at home."
                  Lewis admitted to Mackenzie that "this conduct surprised me, it being common only
                  among your English Lords, not to be 'at home' when they did not wish to see
                     strangers."<ref target="n0434" n="34"/> Although Lewis and the rest of the
                  American party did manage to find lodging that night, they were not given the
                  chance to present American views to any Menetarra chiefs.</p>
               <p> Lewis did not know that while he was being cold-shouldered in Menetarra, Clark
                  was in the midst of entertaining at Fort Mandan some of the very men Lewis wanted
                  to meet. Sometime during the day of the 25th, with Lewis and all the interpreters
                  away from the fort, two Hidatsa chiefs, one of them Waukeressara, appeared at the
                  expedition's quarters. Clark recognized the significance of the visit, noting that
                  the chiefs were "the first of that Nation who has Visited us Since we have been
                  here." Handicapped by the absence of the interpreters and anxious to pay "a
                  perticular attention" to the visitors, Clark was reduced to handing out some
                  paint, a piece of lace, a handkerchief, and "some other few articles" in hopes of
                  making a favorable impression. The captain believed that the gifts "pleased them
                  very much" but it would take more than an assortment of presents to change Hidatsa
                     attitudes.<ref target="n0435" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p> Unaware of the events at Fort Mandan and feeling rejected by the Hidatsas-proper
                  in Menetarra, Lewis rode over to the Awatixa Hidatsa village on the morning of
                  November 26. Perhaps the American diplomat hoped that among Black Moccasin's
                  people he might gain a more sympathetic hearing. Sometime during the day, after
                  complaining to Mackenzie about his unpleasant experiences in Menetarra, Lewis
                  convened a council of the Awatixa chiefs. Just who attended this meeting in
                  Metaharta is not clear since the only account is from a sketchy narrative written
                  by Mackenzie. Certainly there were Awatixa Hidatsas present, and it is possible
                  that some curious Hidatas-proper also showed up. Lewis began the proceedings by
                  trying to explain the nature and purpose of the American presence. There had been
                  confusion on this point, and the diplomat was eager to clarify the objective of
                  the party as exploration, not trade. But this was a minor point, or so it seemed
                  to Lewis. Mainly, he promoted the twin themes of American policy toward the
                  Indians on the Upper Missouri: peace among the tribes and a villager alliance. To
                  emphasize United States sovereignty and good will, Lewis distributed clothing,
                  medals, and flags. Although some Hidatsas took the gifts, others made a show of
                  rejecting them. At this point several of the Hidatsas gave voice to their
                  feelings, declaring that no matter how many presents were offered, they "could not
                  be reconciled to like these 'strangers' as they called them." The Hidatsa chiefs
                  then complained that "had these Whites come amongst us with charitable views they
                  would have loaded their 'Great Boat' with necessaries. It is true they have
                  ammunition, but they prefer throwing it away idly than sparing a shot of it to a
                  poor Mandan."</p>
               <p> Lewis's response to these complaints was oddly inappropriate. Unlimbering his
                  airgun, he gave a quick demonstration of its accuracy and fire power. The
                  assembled Indians were certainly impressed with the weapon and "dreaded the magic
                  of its owners," but Lewis had hardly quieted their fears. Nor had he gained any
                  converts for the American gospel. The complaints continued, and at last one
                  Hidatsa chief boasted that if his young warriors ever caught the Americans on the
                  plains they would share the fate of hunted wolves. Unimpressed with either the
                  expedition's weaponry or Lewis's diplomacy, the same chief insisted that there
                  were only two sensible men in the entire American expedition, "the worker of iron
                  and the mender of guns."</p>
               <p> Despite these allegations and veiled threats, Lewis may well have thought his
                  mission was at least partially successful. The explorer extracted a promise from
                  some Hidatsa chiefs not to wage war on distant peoples such as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and Blackfeet. But such a promise was hardly binding, and no
                  sooner had Lewis let Metaharta than the chief of the Wolves, a society of young
                  warriors, took a party of fifty to raid the Blackfeet. Lewis also may have thought
                  he had made some diplomatic progress because two Hidatsa chiefs, Marnohtoh and
                  Mannessurree, agreed to return with him to Fort Mandan for further talks.<ref target="n0436" n="36"/>
               </p>
               <p> Once back at Fort Mandan, there were more talks and now some of the sources for
                  Hidatsa distrust of the expedition were revealed. The chiefs unleashed a torrent
                  of pent-up anger and poorly concealed abuse on the captains. The first part of
                  that torrent concerned rumors spread by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and designed to keep the Hidatsas from coming to trade at the
                  fort. The Hidatsa chiefs claimed the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> had told them that the Americans were in league with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and were preparing a secret winter attack. This rumor was added
                  to another Mandan-inspired tale which insisted that any Hidatsa who went to the
                  expedition's quarters would be killed by the explorers. These rumors gained weight
                  among the Hidatsa villagers as they witnessed a number of events for which there
                  seemed no explanation except a sinister one. When René Jusseaume moved his
                  family into Fort Mandan, many Hidatsas saw this as a sign of a coming attack. The
                  Hidatsas were further worried by the sheer size of Fort Mandan and its well-armed
                  occupants. A number of chiefs were offended also at what they called "the
                  high-sounding language the American captains bestowed upon themselves and their
                  nation, wishing to impress the Indians with an idea that they were great warriors,
                  and a powerful people, who, if exasperated, could crush all the nations of the
                  earth." As Alexander Henry the Younger later explained, such saber rattling did
                  not set well with the proud Hidatsas.</p>
               <p> Rumor, misunderstanding, and a dash of American swagger were not the only things
                  that had alienated the Hidatsas. There was the matter of economic ties with
                  British traders and what Lewis and Clark believed to be illegal political activity
                  by North West Company agents. The captains knew long before they got to the Upper
                  Missouri that they would encounter British citizens working for the two great
                  trading companies. As Lewis and Clark understood it, American policy was to allow
                  such business activity by foreign nationals to continue so long as it did not
                  threaten federal sovereignty. The explorers had made it plain in their earliest
                  meetings with Mackenzie and François Antoine Larocque that North West Company
                  agents would not be forced out of the new lands of the Louisiana Purchase as long
                  as they did not distribute any symbols of political authority such as flags and
                  medals. After listening to the Hidatsas' charges, the captains were convinced that
                  Jean Baptiste La France, a North West Company clerk working for Larocque and
                  Mackenzie, was speaking "unfavorably" among the Hidatsas about American actions
                  and intentions. There is no doubt that the Indian villagers felt close enough to
                  the British traders to exclude American economic overtures. They did not need
                  someone like La France to remind them of the important role played by both the
                  Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. Le Borgne himself made his
                  preferences known in a conversation with Charles Mackenzie. The chief "said a
                  great deal in favor of the [North West] Company, but he did not praise the
                  Americans."</p>
               <p> And there was one final sentiment voiced by the Hidatsas at the end of November.
                  Lewis and Clark believed that an Indian policy promoting peace between the tribes
                  was both humane and rational. Many younger Hidatsa warriors did not share that
                  view. They explained that forswearing raids on enemies would leave unavenged the
                  deaths of relatives. More important, without the status gained by deeds of valor
                  there would be no way to select village leaders. Lewis recorded one young
                  warrior's concern that "if they were in a state of peace with all their neighbors
                  what would the nation do for chiefs?" This man saw the unfortunate cultural
                  consequences of peace, explaining that "the chiefs were now old and must shortly
                  die and that the nation could not exist without chiefs."</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark may well have been overwhelmed by both the vehemence and the
                  number of Hidatsa grievances. Just how Lewis answered them is not recorded in the
                  expedition journals. Clark only noted with forced optimism that "all those reports
                  was contredicted by Capt. Lewis with a conviction on the minds of the Indians of
                  the falsity of those reports." But little had really changed. The Hidatsas were no
                  more prepared to become part of the American grand design than before. All the
                  concerns that had forced Lewis's Hidatsa mission were still unresolved. In fact,
                  now that the captains knew just how much tension there was between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas as well as what many Hidatsas thought about the
                  expedition, there may have been more reason to fear for the future.<ref target="n0437" n="37"/>
               </p>
               <p> Determined to do whatever they could to preserve a policy toward the Indians that
                  now seemed on the verge of complete collapse, Lewis and Clark decided to call in
                  the Nor'Wester Larocque for a severe tongue-lashing. Unable to change Indian
                  realities, the captains evidently fixed on the Nor'Westers as the source of the
                  expedition's difficulties. Although La France had probably done all he could to
                  keep the Hidatsas loyal to their North West Company partners and Larocque had
                  sometimes made a nuisance of himself in pressing his request to accompany the
                  Americans to the Pacific, Lewis and Clark had no real evidence to suggest that
                  British traders were inciting opposition to American authority. Nonetheless, on
                  November 28 the captains met with Black Cat and other Mandan chiefs for "a little
                  talk on the Subject of the British Trader M. Le rock Giveing meadals and Flags."
                  The chiefs were told that if they accepted such gifts they would "incur the
                  displeasure of their Great American Father."<ref target="n0438" n="38"/>
               </p>
               <p> With the Indians properly warned, Lewis and Clark turned directly to Larocque. On
                  the following day the trader and one of his men came to Fort Mandan just as a
                  soldier in the expedition was setting out to summon him. Larocque was treated well
                  enough; in fact, relations between the traders and the explorers were to remain
                  genial during most of the winter. There was a good deal of mutual visiting between
                  the two groups and the captains found men like Larocque, Mackenzie, and Hugh Heney
                  to be valuable sources of information on a wide variety of subjects. But now the
                  tension of the past several weeks began to show as Lewis and Clark accused
                  Larocque of intending to distribute medals and flags. He quickly replied that, in
                  failing to carry such objects with him, he "ran no risk of disobeying" their
                  orders. Apparently put off by that disclaimer, the captains then brought
                  Charbonneau into the discussion. Charbonneau, with the expedition's permission,
                  had been working part-time for Larocque in the trade with the Hidatsas.
                  Charbonneau was "strictly enjoined not to utter a word to the Indians which might
                  in any way be to the prejudice of the United States, or any of its citizens," even
                  if Larocque ordered him to do so. Turning to Larcoque, one of the captains added
                  sarcastically, "Which we are very far from thinking you would." The air
                  temporarily cleared, the explorers and traders spent a pleasant evening at the
                  fort. Larocque was told about American trade policy on the Upper Missouri and the
                  extension of the factory system into the region. "In short," recalled Larocque,
                  "during the time I was there a very grand plan was schemed, but its being realized
                  is more than I can tell, although the Captains say they are well assured it
                     will."<ref target="n0439" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p> Nothing of substance had changed. Lewis and Clark may have felt confident about
                  Larocque's "fair promises," but the fundamental problems undermining that "very
                  grand plan" were no nearer resolution. All the fears and concerns that drove Lewis
                  to make his ill-fated journey to the Hidatsa towns had not gone away. Like
                  virtually all white diplomats on the North American frontier, Lewis and Clark
                  found it difficult to believe that they could not easily rearrange Indian
                  realities to serve non-Indian interests. The captains were not the masters of
                  Upper Missouri Indian affairs. They were simply players in a complex game made
                  more intricate by their very presence. Just how helpless the expedition was to
                  shape native actions became painfully clear at the end of November.</p>
               <p> Friday morning, November 30, seemed like the beginning of any other routine day
                  at Fort Mandan. There had been a hard frost overnight and now hut fires were
                  stoked up to beat back the cold. At eight o'clock the quiet was broken by a voice
                  shouting from the other side of the Missouri. A Mandan called for a pirogue to
                  ferry him across the river, explaining he had "something of consequence to
                  communicate." Once in the fort, the Indian presented the captains with news that
                  alarmed them and at the same time offered a unique opportunity for the expedition
                  to flex its military muscle. He explained that five Mandan hunters had been
                  surprised and attacked by a party of Teton and Arikara warriors. In the struggle
                  that followed one villager was killed, two were wounded, and nine horses were
                  stolen. There had also been trouble between the raiders and hunters from Mahawha.
                  Four Hidatsas from that village were missing and rumors were flying of an imminent
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-Arikara attack.</p>
               <p> Although news of a joint <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara raiding party had obvious implications for the future
                  of a villager alliance, Lewis and Clark felt that the first order of business was
                  a firm demonstration of American force to punish those who had attacked the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Where words had failed, the explorers were now ready to use
                  military action. "We thought it well," explained Clark, "to Show a Disposition to
                  ade and assist them against their enemies, perticularly those who Came in
                  oppersition to our Councels." After a hurried discussion, the captains organized a
                  large armed party of soldiers from the fort. Lewis and Clark expected to swell
                  their own ranks by obtaining volunteers from Mitutanka, Rooptahee, and
                  Mahawha.</p>
               <p> By midmorning Clark had his men ready for action. The putative expedition
                  consisted of Clark, Ordway, Jusseaume, and about twenty soldiers. Crossing the
                  Missouri, the group headed for the Mandan village of Mitutanka. Once across the
                  river, Clark arrayed his troops in battle formation with men out on each flank and
                  a covering rear guard. Sergeant Ordway, who was on the left flank, recalled later
                  that heavy brush matted down with snow made the march slow and difficult. Finally
                  making their way out of the river bottom, the Americans broke onto the level plain
                  behind Mitutanka. Clark had planned the show of force as a means to impress and
                  reassure the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. But his unannounced arrival had just the opposite
                  effect. "The Indians not expected to receive Such Strong aide in So Short a time
                  was much surprised, and a little allarmed at the formadable appearence of my
                  party." When Clark and his men were about two hundred yards from the village, a
                  very worried Sheheke and several other chiefs came out and nervously invited the
                  Americans into the town. While the soldiers went into several lodges to rest and
                  warm up, Clark tried to explain the nature of his mission. Hoping to calm the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>' fears, the captain declared that he and his men were
                  there to "chastise the enemies of our Dutifull Chieldren." Turning to Black Cat,
                  who was evidently in Mitutanka or other business, Clark asked him to verify the
                  assault on the Mandan hunters. This done, Clark then recommended that war parties
                  from both Mandan villages join the American forces "to meet the Army of Souex and
                  chastise them for taking the blood of our Dutiful Children."</p>
               <p> If the Mandan chiefs were alarmed by the arrival of heavily armed soldiers, they
                  were astounded at Clark's proposal. For a large Mandan-American force to venture
                  out in the cold and snow in search of an elusive Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> party made no sense to the chiefs. They had taken the attack as
                  just one more in a long series of episode between the nomads and the villagers.
                  The dead man could be avenged in the spring. Clearly the chiefs found the American
                  suggestions both puzzling and disturbing. After a brief talk among themselves, Big
                  Man explained that all the villagers were impressed with the readiness of the
                  Americans to defend them. Trying to accept some of the blame for the attack and
                  thereby defuse the situation, the chief said that his people "carelessly went out
                  to hunt in small parties believing themselves to be safe from the other nations."
                  Although Lewis and Clark tended to portray the Tetons as the instigators in this
                  and other attacks, Big Man saved his harshest words for the Arikaras. Recalling
                  the discussion of the Arikara truce at the meetings in late October, Big Man
                  revealed for the first time his harsh words directed at the visiting Indian
                  diplomat. "I knew," insisted the Mandan chief, "that the Panies [Arikaras] were
                  liers, and told the old Chief who Came with you (to Confirm a peace with us) that
                  his people were liers and bad men and that we killed them like the Buffalo, when
                  we pleased." Big Man again expressed the common Mandan view that any peace with
                  the aggressive Arikaras was bound to be unstable. He added that two Arikara men
                  who had been in Mitutanka at the time of the raid were sent packing by the chiefs
                  for fear that revenge might be taken on them. According to Big Man, those visitors
                  reported that two of the Arikara towns "were making their Mockersons," a sure sign
                  of preparation for war, and that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> "had best take care of [their] horses." Big Man admitted that
                  there were some Teton warriors in the Arikara villages who were "not well disposed
                  towards us," but the Mandan chief felt certain the real blame rested with the
                  troublesome Arikaras. Even so, the prospect of rushing out to "chastise" the
                  Arikaras in the dead of a Dakota winter had little appeal to any of the villagers.
                  "My father," said Big Man, "the Snow is deep and it is cold, our horses Cannot
                  travel through the plains, those people who have spilt our blood have gone back."
                  Not wanting to seem ungrateful in the face of American support—support the
                  Indians were not sure they really wanted—Big Man offered the alternative of
                  a joint war party when spring came.</p>
               <p> By now Clark must have realized that an attack on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara raiders with Mandan support was not to be. His
                  enthusiasm for fighting dampened by Mandan reluctance and the simple passage of
                  time in a warm lodge, Clark used the remaining hours for more diplomatic talk.
                  Once again he emphasized the readiness of American forces to defend friendly
                  Indians against any enemy and urged the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> to report the presence of hostile warriors directly to the
                  captains. Substituting tough words for strong action, Clark boasted that he
                  "wished to meet those Seeoux and all others who will not open their ears, but make
                  war on our dutiful Children." The captain had made his point about the use of
                  force. He now knew that rumors about Arikara faithlessness were being treated as
                  truth by Mandan chiefs. Allowed to go unchallenged, such sentiments could destroy
                  any hope for the villager alliance. Clark cautioned the chiefs against indicting
                  all Arikaras for what he termed the actions of a few "bad men." "Do not get mad
                  with the recarees," he counseled, "until we [know] if those bad men are
                  countenanced by their nation, and we are convinced those people do not intend to
                  follow our Councils." Returning to his understanding of the economic relationship
                  between the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and the Arikara towns, Clark tried to make a case for the Tetons
                  leading the Arikaras "astray." He also used the opportunity to remind the chiefs
                  that just as the Arikaras were forced to accept <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> domination, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> had to swallow <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> insults rather than risk war with the northern
                  Indians and a possible interruption of trade goods from Canada.</p>
               <p> Talks went on for some time until coming darkness made Clark decide to return to
                  Fort Mandan. The journey back in failing light and deep snow proved to be "verry
                  fatigueing." To boost their spirits once inside the fort, each man was given an
                  extra liquor ration. But for the captains even extra spirits could not change the
                  fact that their venture into gunboat diplomacy had proved a dismal failure and
                  something of an embarrassment.<ref target="n0440" n="40"/>
               </p>
               <p> The day must have been an unsettling climax to a troubled month. At the end of
                  October, with the initial Mandan and Hidatsa councils finished, Lewis and Clark
                  had believed they were well on the way to achieving their Indian policy goals.
                  Then the Arikara peace seemed assured and unity among the village peoples appeared
                  probable. But events throughout November challenged those assumptions. The
                  captains' best efforts to salvage something of their plans failed. Their response
                  to the attack on the Mandan hunters was symbolic of how little white outsiders
                  could alter Indian realities. Held prisoner by their own political and cultural
                  values, the captains were determined to use the incident as an excuse for the
                  display of their military might and, with some luck, to strike a blow against the
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. Differing perspectives on warfare and diplomacy meant
                  that the Mandan chiefs found the American desire for winter revenge at best
                  baffling and at worst stupid. Lewis's unhappy Hidatsa foray could now be matched
                  by an equally fruitless Clark journey into the complicated Upper Missouri Indian
                  world.</p>
               <p> As the snow and cold of a Dakota December closed in, the captains found more of
                  their time taken up with the demands of food, warm clothing, and reliable fires.
                  They had no intention of ignoring the uneasy state of Indian affairs around them,
                  but travel conditions and lack of sufficient information narrowed their options
                  and limited what actions could be taken. Believing that the Mandan chiefs had been
                  both impressed and reassured, they had only to discover the current state of
                  Arikara <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> relations. In the first week of December the explorers
                  sent a letter to the traders Tabeau and Gravelines, who were at the Grand River
                  villages, pleading for news. But it was more than simple news gathering that the
                  explorers wanted from the St. Louis men. They asked the traders "to interseed in
                  preventing hostilities." Lewis and Clark wanted both the Arikaras and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> to be warned of "what part we intend to take" if either group
                  broke the peace. Lacking any real power to back up such threats, the captains
                  probably hoped the personal influence of the traders would carry the day.<ref target="n0441" n="41"/>

            <div type="section">
               <p> The Mandan winter was neither all high diplomacy nor a nerve-racking round of
                  alarms and confusions. Most of the five months spent at Fort Mandan were taken up
                  with demands for food and shelter. Explorers and Indians got to know each other in
                  ways that had little to do with federal policy or grand councils. Visiting,
                  hunting, trading, and sexual adventures were all common ground where people from
                  different cultures could talk, joke, haggle, and compete in the shared struggle
                  for life on the northern plains.</p>
               <p> Fort Mandan was no isolated frontier outpost, caught in the grip of a Dakota
                  winter and cut off from the simple pleasures of human companionship. Long before
                  Lewis and Clark came to the Upper Missouri, Mandan and Hidatsa villagers had
                  brightened their winters with a steady round of visits to the lodges of friends
                  and neighbors. Life in the winter camps could be harsh and hungry, but there also
                  were times for storytelling and gossip. Once Fort Mandan was built, the Americans
                  simply became part of that social web that bound the villagers together. Nothing
                  seemed more natural than the desire of explorer and Indian alike to see each other
                  at home and share some food and friendship.</p>
               <p> From the moment the expedition reached its winter quarters, Indian visitors came
                  in a steady stream. Fascinated by the "great boat," the endless variety of curious
                  objects, and the Americans themselves, village men, women, and especially
                  children, could not get enough close looks at the bearded strangers. Although some
                  Indians came to trade, Clark remarked later in the winter that most were "lookers
                  on" simply attracted by the presence of the expedition.<ref target="n0442" n="42"/> By the end of the councils in late October, any initial reserve each group had
                  about the other was gone. When Clark returned on October 30 from a trip upriver
                  looking for a suitable fort location, he found his men gaily dancing sets and
                  reels, "which pleased the savages much."<ref target="n0443" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p> Once the expedition's workmen began to build Fort Mandan, there was even more
                  reason for Indians to come down and watch the construction of a great lodge the
                  size and shape of which they had never seen. Just how much good-natured banter was
                  possible between Indian onlookers and American workers is not part of the
                  expedition's record, but throughout November there was hardly a day in which
                  numbers of Indians did not come to inspect the construction.<ref target="n0444" n="44"/> By the end of the month, as the fort took shape, it was possible for
                  the explorers to invite selected Indian visitors—usually chiefs, elders, and
                  their families—into their rooms. On November 20, for example, three chiefs
                  from Rooptahee paid a visit, stayed all day, and were "verry Curious in examining
                  our works."<ref target="n0445" n="45"/>
               </p>
               <p> Indians were drawn not only to the fort itself but to the many "curiosities" they
                  found inside. It had long been the expedition's practice to display all sorts of
                  weapons and scientific instruments to Indians in an effort to impress them with
                  American technology. When Le Borgne and other Hidatsas came to the fort in early
                  March 1805, they were shown everything from Lewis's airgun to his spyglass. The
                  Hidatsas promptly proclaimed these devices to be "Great Medicines." Whether
                  impressed or not, many visitors found the objects both mysterious and compelling.
                  Thermometers, quadrants, writing paper, and metal objects of all sorts were worth
                  a special trip. It was as if Fort Mandan had become a living museum of white
                  American life, familiar in some ways but novel in so many others.<ref target="n0446" n="46"/>
               </p>
               <p> During most of the winter, Indians were welcomed at Fort Mandan with unfailing
                  hospitality. Only once during the entire season were Indians asked not to visit
                  the fort. On Christmas Day, 1804, the expedition wanted to do its own celebrating.
                  Native neighbors were told that the festivities were part of a special "medicine
                  day" for whites only. On every other day the gates were open. When a group of
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> appeared in early December, the captains "gave them
                  victuals &amp; used them friendly." Lewis and Clark's hospitality was well known;
                  Indians often came early in the day, slept overnight inside the fort if invited,
                  and left the next morning. When meat became very scarce in mid-January, many
                  Indians came to the fort hoping to be fed. Although the expedition was not any
                  better supplied than the villagers, Ordway reported that "we use them as well as
                     possible."<ref target="n0447" n="47"/>
               </p>
               <p> Indian visitors brought to the expedition's huts a sense of friendship and "good
                  company." Visits from Indian neighbors usually meant sharing food and enjoying a
                  dance or some fiddle music by Pierre Cruzatte. There must have been time to
                  appreciate a fine bow, a good gun, or a skillfully decorated pair of moccasins.
                  Older men like Black Cat often told what Clark described as "Indian aneckdotes."
                  Although none of those stories was set down in their journals, the Americans may
                  have heard the sorts of stories and tales told in lodges among friends.<ref target="n0448" n="48"/>
               </p>
               <p> The sheer numbers of that company sometimes tested patience on both sides of the
                  cultural divide. Lewis called the Indians "good company" and in the same breath
                  complained that "they usually pester us the ballance of the day after once being
                  introduced to our apartment." Ordway peevishly recalled that on one day in
                  mid-December he had fourteen Indians all eating in his squad room at the same
                  time. On another occasion, when the weather suddenly turned warm at the end of
                  December, "great numbers of indians of all discriptions Came to the fort." In
                  fact, there were so many visitors during the day that Ordway complained, "We found
                  them troublesome in our huts." Misunderstandings were inevitable. When an Indian
                  did something to annoy Joseph Whitehouse, the soldier struck the man on his hand
                  with a spoon.<ref target="n0449" n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p> Despite the tensions that would naturally come when people meet each other at
                  close quarters, the daily round of Indian visitors was a welcome part of the Fort
                  Mandan routine. Later, at Fort Clatsop on the Pacific, the captains would feel
                  compelled to issue strict regulations controlling the presence of Indians inside
                  the palisade. The Fort Mandan rules were much looser. The only serious attempt at
                  limiting native guests came in early February when the sergeant of the guard
                  discovered that women belonging to the Charbonneau and Jusseaume households "were
                  in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any time of night and admitting their
                  Indian visitors." Concerned about this breach of security at a time when <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> attacks were still a real fear, Lewis ordered a lock placed on
                  the gate and restricted Indians sleeping at the fort to those either attached to
                  the Corps of Discovery or those with invitations from the captains.<ref target="n0450" n="50"/>
               </p>
               <p> Social calling was a two-way affair during the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Members of the expedition managed to make frequent trips to
                  the Mandan villages. Those trips were usually for trade and occasionally for
                  personal affairs, but some were simply for good company. When Gass and a friend
                  went up to the Mandan towns during a break in the January weather, they were given
                  a warm welcome and plenty to eat. These visits were a regular part of the
                  explorers' lives during an otherwise difficult winter.</p>
               <p> Perhaps the grandest, and certainly the loudest, visit paid by the expedition to
                  the Indian towns was in celebration of New Year's Day, 1805. Both English and
                  French traditions called for a boisterous, joyful romp to usher in the new year.
                  On January 1, after firing two swivel guns to mark the occasion, the captains
                  allowed sixteen men "with their Musick" to visit Mitutanka "for the purpose of
                  Dancing." The merry men of the expedition had told Clark that their visit was made
                  at "the perticular request of the Chiefs of that Village." Led by John Ordway, the
                  party left the fort carrying a fiddle, a tambourine, and a sounding horn. At the
                  entrance to Mitutanka the Americans fired their weapons and played a brisk tune.
                  Welcomed into the village, they marched to the central plaza, fired another round,
                  and began to dance. The Mandan onlookers were especially charmed by the ability of
                  François Rivet to dance upside down on his hands. All joined in a circle
                  around Rivet, dancing and singing. After some time all the revelers were invited
                  into the lodges for food and gifts of buffalo robes.</p>
               <p> Toward noon Clark appeared with York, Jusseaume, and a third man. Clark's walk up
                  to Mitutanka combined pleasure and diplomacy. "My views," he explained, "were to
                  alay Some little Miss understanding which had taken place Thro jelloucy and
                  mortification as to our treatment of them." When Clark arrived at the Mandan town,
                  he found the festivities in full swing. To add to the merriment, he called on York
                  to dance, "which amused the crowd very much, and somewhat astonished them, that so
                  large a man should be active." As the good times continued throughout the
                  afternoon, Clark visited the lodges of all except two of Mitutanka's leading men.
                  Those who did not merit a holiday greeting were guilty, so Clark charged, of "some
                  expressions not favorable towards us, in comparing us with the traders from the
                  north." Clearly some <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> believed that agents of the North West Company and the Hudson's
                  Bay Company continued to offer better trade agreements and gifts than the
                  Americans. But all this was put right when other <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> reassured the captains that the remarks were made "in jest and
                  laftur." Late in the afternoon the eating and dancing finally played out and most
                  of the men in the expedition went back to Fort Mandan. Some stayed in Mitutanka
                  overnight to enjoy other kinds of Mandan hospitality.<ref target="n0451" n="51"/>
               </p>
               <p> One day of New Year's celebrating simply led to another, and with a second Mandan
                  village nearby, no one needed any more reason to make a second round of holiday
                  cheer. This time it was Lewis's turn. Along with Gass, the captain and most of the
                  garrison went out on January 2 toward Rooptahee. At the village there was more of
                  what Ordway described as "frolicking." Eating, dancing, and a general good time
                  were enjoyed by soldiers and villagers alike.<ref target="n0452" n="52"/>
               </p>
               <p> The expedition and its Indian neighbors were drawn to each other not only by the
                  shared desire for friendship but by the needs of business and trade. The explorers
                  had an insatiable appetite for Mandan corn and other produce. The kills made by
                  expeditionary hunters had to be supplemented by buffalo and antelope brought by
                  Indians. Filling the larders of Fort Mandan brought Indian suppliers and white
                  consumers together to haggle over what a basket of corn was worth and just how
                  many hoes could be mended for a side of buffalo.</p>
               <p> Although Indians occasionally brought food to the fort as a gift, the expedition
                  learned early in its stay that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> were skilled traders who expected good measure for their crops.
                  At the end of October, just as the Americans were establishing winter quarters,
                  Mandan women began to bring corn and cornbread into camp. As Ordway observed,
                  "They expect us to give them some small article in return for their produce."<ref target="n0453" n="53"/> As winter drew on and word spread that the fort was a
                  good market for food products, a steady stream of Indian men and women came to
                  trade. In one typical exchange, Little Raven and his wife brought a quantity of
                  corn meal and were given some dried buffalo meat, a pot, and an axe. On another
                  occasion Sheheke had his wife pack down one hundred pounds of buffalo, which was
                  exchanged for "some small presents to the squar and [the] child [received] a small
                  axe [with] which she was very much pleased." There is no evidence that Lewis and
                  Clark ever worked out a uniform price and exchange schedule in which certain
                  amounts of corn or meat would automatically receive a set quantity of trade goods
                  or blacksmith services. Rather, it appears that each purchase was bargained on the
                  spot. The captains were willing to barter almost anything in their store of goods
                  in order to maintain a steady supply of food. However, they refused to trade in
                  firearms. When an old man came looking for a pistol in return for some corn and
                  four buffalo robes, his offer was firmly rejected.<ref target="n0454" n="54"/>
               </p>
               <p> Because the expedition so desperately needed Indian corn and the captains knew
                  that there was a tremendous demand among the natives for metal goods, an
                  interesting exchange system gradually developed between Fort Mandan and the nearby
                  villages. That system involved Indians bringing corn as payment for blacksmith
                  work done at the Fort Mandan forge. Under the direction of John Shields, a skilled
                  smith, the expedition's force and bellows were put in place at the end of
                  December. Iron hoes were mended, firearms were repaired, and later a brisk
                  business was done fabricating battle axes. Indian visitors to the fort were "much
                  surprized" by workings of the machinery and once the captains let them know of the
                  new arrangement for trade, corn supplies quickly increased.<ref target="n0455" n="55"/>
               </p>
               <p> Until late January 1805, this system seemed to work well. Indians got hoes mended
                  and axes sharpened while the expedition maintained a dependable store of
                  provisions. But this exchange economy had a curious flaw. There were only so many
                  hoes in need of repair and only a limited number of dull axes. By the end of
                  January, the blacksmith-corn trade stood in danger of shutting down for want of
                  Indian interest. Lewis and Clark then shrewdly analyzed the requirements of their
                  Indian customers. Despite the fact that intertribal peace was a mainstay of the
                  expedition's diplomacy, the captains decided to enter the weapons business. Their
                  plan was both to manufacture and to repair war axes, a weapon much in demand by
                  Upper Missouri warriors. This new aspects of expedition-Indian trade demanded an
                  expansion of Fort Mandan's industrial capacity. More charcoal was needed for the
                  forge, and on January 24 work parties were detailed to begin cutting timber.
                  Several days later prairie grass was cut to cover a makeshift charcoal kiln. By
                  January 29 Clark reported, "We are burning a large Coal pit to mend Indians
                  hatchets, and to make war axes." The captain readily admitted that the weapons
                  trade was vital for the expedition's survival, noting it was "the only means by
                  which we procure corn from them."<ref target="n0456" n="56"/>
               </p>
               <p> For the rest of the winter the smiths were busy filling Indian orders for war
                  axes. When the forge ran far behind on orders, an old burned-out stove was
                  salvaged and cut up to make arrow points and buffalohide scrapers. Because
                  unworked metal was so scarce at this point, Lewis established a short-term
                  exchange schedule. The smiths were to charge seven or eight gallons of corn for
                  each four-inch piece of sheet iron. Just how important this trade had become was
                  plain when Lewis wrote that "the blacksmiths have proved a happy resource to us in
                  our present situation as I believe it would have been difficult to have devised
                  any other method to have procured corn from the natives." As the winter began to
                  break in March and warriors started to talk about the spring raids, the pace of
                  war axe production increased. By March 13, Clark observed, "Many Indians here
                  today all anxiety for war axes the smiths have not an hour of idle time to spare."
                  Because the captains had so often emphasized the American desire to end
                  intertribal wars, arming warriors with weapons made at Fort Mandan put the
                  explorer-diplomats in an odd position. The captains never intended to fuel the
                  fires of raid and ambush, but neither were they so naive as to think that the
                  "impliments of War" from the Mandan forge were for defensive purposes only.
                  Typical of this dilemma was the request from a Menetarra war chief who came to
                  purchase an axe and obtain permission to attack <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara warriors. For the proper price in corn the axe was
                  handed over, but the request to use it was denied. The Hidatsa chief must have
                  wondered just what sort of man would arm a warrior and then tell him not to engage
                  the enemy. The war axes were prized possessions and some ended up being traded
                  with other Indians for equally desirable goods. How far those products of the
                  Mandan forge traveled was discovered some fourteen months later when the
                  expedition, on its way home, stopped at the Pahmap <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> village. Ordway discovered that the Fort Mandan axes were
                  being used as pieces in an Indian gambling game. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> player explained that they had gotten the axes from some
                  Hidatsa traders.<ref target="n0457" n="57"/>
               </p>
               <p> If trading brought explorers and Indians closer together as business partners,
                  those same transactions provide modern students of Indian-European relations with
                  some valuable evidence about how each culture saw the other. The men of the
                  expedition were often bewildered by watching the Indians bring in valuable food
                  supplies in exchange for what seemed worthless bits of metal and fabric. Gass
                  insisted that Mandan men and women were eager to have "old shirts, buttons, awls,
                  knives, and the like articles." Other journalists in the party, as well as many
                  early traders, agreed with that evaluation.<ref target="n0458" n="58"/> It was
                  equally true that Indians wondered why whites were so ready to part with precious
                  metal goods for corn that could be grown every year. Neither group fully realized
                  that cultures value objects and goods differently, depending on the needs and
                  circumstances of that particular culture. A classic case of the differing
                  perspectives on material culture was the use made by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> of a corn mill given to them by the expedition during the
                  winter. Although the Indians were fascinated by the device, they had no use for it
                  in its present state. On the other hand, the metal in the grinder was a scarce and
                  valuable commodity to be made into arrow points and hide scrapers. The Mandan
                  promptly dismantled the mill to serve their own cultural needs. The largest piece
                  was attached to a wooden handle and what emerged was a fine pounder for making
                  grease from buffalo marrow bones. When Alexander Henry the Younger saw the
                  skillful transformation of the corn mill, he quickly labeled the Mandan mechanics
                  "foolish fellows."<ref target="n0459" n="59"/>
               </p>
               <p> But the Indian interest in European goods of all kinds was more than a matter of
                  obtaining the fruits of western iron technology. Native peoples throughout North
                  America often saw European goods as something more than just material objects.
                  This was especially the case with guns, peace medals, Christian missionary relics,
                  and coins. Those things were venerated as both symbols and transmitters of the
                  strong medicine and spiritual energy the whites seemed to possess. Lewis had some
                  inkling of this when he wrote in 1807 that the Indians believed the first white
                  traders "were the most powerful persons in the nation."<ref target="n0460" n="60"/> The power of the whites could be shared with others by wearing or using things
                  associated with them. Some Hidatsa-proper villagers gave voice to that belief when
                  they claimed that the gifts, flags, and silver medals distributed by Lewis and
                  Clark contained powerful evil forces that reflected the dangerous intent of the
                  expedition. Fearing the "bad medicine" in the objects, the Hidatsas thought the
                  best thing to be done with such hazardous goods was to pawn them off on
                  unsuspecting enemies.<ref target="n0461" n="61"/> Just as white Americans a
                  century and a half later would prize bits of pottery and arrow points as reminders
                  of a distant and mysterious native past, so Mandan and Hidatsa men and women
                  valued buttons and tobacco boxes as links, for good or ill, to powerful
                  strangers.</p>
               <p> Although visiting and trading were important parts of life shared by Indians and
                  explorers during the long winter months, few activities bound the men of the fort
                  to the villagers as did hunting. Both cultures valued the hunter for his skill in
                  a dangerous pursuit. Throughout the winter there were many joint hunting parties.
                  Those trips, often in bitter cold and through deep snow, served to increase the
                  sense of sharing a common life on the plains.</p>
               <p> One such hunting venture took place in early December. When buffalo were
                  discovered nearby, Sheheke sent word to the fort and invited the expedition to
                  join the chase. Always ready to replenish their food stores, Lewis, Gass, and
                  fourteen other men gathered with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> for the hunt. The explorers watched with admiration as the
                  mounted Indian hunters guided the buffalo herd away from broken ground and on to a
                  level plain where each man cut out an animal for the kill. Lewis and his men were
                  able to kill ten buffalo, five of which were packed back to the fort. The
                  remaining dead animals were, according to plains custom, available for any hunter
                  to butcher and take along. On the second day of the hunt, as the temperature fell
                  to -12°F, Clark joined the chase. The expedition's guns brought down several
                  more buffalo, but the harsh cold and broken ground extracted a high price for the
                  meat. Several of the hunters had frostbitten feet, two men had badly bruised hips
                  from falling on hard ground, and York had a frostbitten penis. This rigorous
                  two-day adventure added food to Fort Mandan larders and surely impressed the
                  explorers with the Indians' hunting skills. Clark certainly understood the
                  physical requirements of the winter buffalo hunt when he admitted he "felt a
                  little fatigued haveing run after the Buffalow all day in Snow many Places 18
                  inches Deep, generally 6 or 8." It was that kind of understanding that made
                  hunters from both cultures value and appreciate each other.<ref target="n0462" n="62"/>
               </p>
               <p> The need for medical attention was yet another force that brought Indians and
                  explorers together during that winter. Native doctoring focused on the healing of
                  cuts, bruises, and abrasions. Because the captains had the reputation as powerful
                  spirit beings, some Indians believed that white medical techniques might be
                  especially effective in serious cases. At the end of December, for example, a
                  woman brought her child who was suffering from a severe abscess on the lower back.
                  Anxious to obtain "some medisin," the worried mother promised "as much corn as she
                  could carry" as payment. Clark laconically wrote that "Capt. Lewis administered,"
                  but his method of treatment and the outcome were not recorded. Perhaps the most
                  serious Indian case the captains dealt with involved the young adopted son of a
                  Mitutanka family. At temperatures around -40°F, the young boy had wandered
                  away from the village and had spent the night on the prairie protected only by a
                  buffalo robe. When the boy was found, his feet were severely frostbitten. The
                  lad's feet were put in cool water and Clark had hopes that the circulation would
                  return. But the captain's expectations were too optimistic. By January 27, some
                  seventeen days after the initial treatment, the toes on one foot were clearly
                  infected. Lewis decided that in order to prevent gangrene, the toes would have to
                  be removed. The amputation was evidently successful and it may be presumed that
                  the boy recovered.<ref target="n0463" n="63"/>
               </p>
               <p> The sorts of sexual encounters between expedition men and Indian women that began
                  at the Arikara villages continued during the winter among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. The young Americans were looking for something to soften the
                  rigors of a Dakota winter, and the Mandan women were willing for the same reasons
                  as their Arikara sisters. There is little doubt that the explorers found village
                  women attractive. Ordway noted after the first Mandan meeting that the Indians
                  "had Some handsome women with them."<ref target="n0464" n="64"/> He became
                  involved in Fort Mandan's first troublesome sexual affair. One morning, toward the
                  end of November, the sentry on duty reported that an Indian was about to kill his
                  wife. Hoping to stop such a violent act, Clark went outside the fort for a talk
                  with the angry husband. From the conversation came a complex tale of sexual
                  jealousy. About eight days before, the Indian couple had had a bitter argument and
                  the woman had left the village and spent several days with the Charbonneau and
                  Jusseaume women. After a cooling-off-period, the Indian woman had returned to her
                  husband only to have the quarrel flare up again. Beaten and stabbed three times,
                  the terrified woman fled once again to the safety of Sacagawea and her sisters.
                  When Clark tried to quiet the angry husband, the captain was told that Ordway was
                  somehow involved in the nasty business. The Indian claimed that Ordway had slept
                  with his wife, and "if he wanted her he would give her to him." Clark then ordered
                  Ordway to give the irate man some trade goods to soothe his ruffled feathers. But
                  at the same time, the captain chided the Indian, saying that "not one man of this
                  party had touched his wife except the one he had given the use of her for a nite,
                  in his own bed." Tacitly admitting that there was a good deal of intercourse
                  between his men and the village women, Clark claimed that they would not "touch a
                  woman if they knew her to be the wife of another man." Exactly how Clark knew the
                  means used to select only unmarried bed partners is unknown, but perhaps believing
                  that Fort Mandan soldiers only slept with single women eased his conscience. In
                  this particular case, the captain ordered that "no man of this party have any
                  intercourse with this woman under penalty of Punishment." As for the unhappy
                  Indian couple, Clark played marriage counselor and advised the pair to go home and
                  "live happily together in the future."<ref target="n0465" n="65"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although not usually so violent as the Ordway affair, sexual liaisons were an
                  accepted part of Fort Mandan life. Regular visits to nearby villages and the large
                  number of women who frequented the fort offered the opportunities sought by both
                  sexes. Lewis and Clark knew well in advance of their departure from St. Louis that
                  sexual relations would be part of the expedition's experience. Understandably,
                  they included the sorts of medical instruments and remedies believed effective
                  against venereal diseases. Symptoms of venereal complaints were first recorded in
                  mid-January 1805. By the end of the month at least one in the party was "very bad
                  with the pox." As the explorers were preparing to leave Fort Mandan at the end of
                  the winter, Clark made yet another revealing statement about the widespread
                  incidence of sex with Indian women and its medical consequences. The captain
                  reported that his crew was "generally healthy except Venerials complaints which is
                  very common amongst the natives and the men catch it from them."<ref target="n0466" n="66"/>
               </p>
               <p> Most sexual affairs during the winter were private matters that satisfied the
                  personal needs of the different partners. But there was one Mandan ceremony that
                  involved sexual relations far beyond the personal and the private. The
                  buffalo-calling or walking ritual involved younger men offering their wives to
                  elderly warriors and hunters for sexual intercourse. Essential to the rite was the
                  belief that power, in this case the hunting abilities of old men, could be
                  transferred from one person to another by sexual relations. Buffalo calling was
                  not simply to lure a herd close to the village but also a means of giving young
                  men special skill in the chase. White males were also sought after as sources for
                  great power. As Clark himself noted, "The Indians say all white flesh is medisan."
                  The Hidatsa chief Le Borgne agreed, saying that "the white men are powerful, they
                  are like magic." Just how many men in the expedition obligingly took part in the
                  ritual is unknown, but the trader Tabeau reported that many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> believed their prompt success in the January hunts was due to
                  white participation in the ceremony. As Tabeau wryly put it, the explorers were
                  "untiringly zealous in attracting the cow."<ref target="n0467" n="67"/>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Lewis and Clark would have been the first to agree that the months of November
                  and December 1804 were troubled ones for their Indian diplomacy. What seemed a set
                  of reliable agreements negotiated at the end of October were undetermined by
                  rumor, distrust, and the power of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>-Arikara alliance. The expedition's efforts to repair the damage
                  appeared futile. Although Lewis and Clark could only wait as Tabeau and Gravelines
                  tried to woo the Arikaras back into the American fold, they could take action to
                  settle Hidatsa concerns and squelch Mandan rumor-mongering. On the afternoon of
                  January 15, four "considerable men of the Menetarre" paid a call at Fort Mandan.
                  Knowing how infrequent were Hidatsa visits, the captains were determined to pay
                  special attention to men "who had been impressed with an unfavorable oppinion of
                  us." Because the Hidatsas were flattered by Lewis and Clark's hospitality, the
                  captains evidently believed some sort of diplomatic thaw was in the air.<ref target="n0468" n="68"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the next day, the four Hidatsas still at the fort were joined by some thirty
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. What followed did nothing either to allay the
                  expedition's worries about Mandan-Hidatsa tensions or to build confidence in a
                  stable villager alliance. Seeing the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, the Hidatsas immediately accused them of being liars. The
                  Hidatsas charged they had been told by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> that expeditionary soldiers would kill any Hidatsa who came to
                  the fort. Clearly nothing had changed since Lewis and Clark first heard the same
                  sort of Mandan rumors at the end of November. The Hidatsa guests were plainly
                  pleased and relieved with their reception at Fort Mandan, but they were not about
                  to accept the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> as either allies or friends. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> were "bad and ought to hide themselves," declared the Hidatsas.
                  Lewis and Clark now found themselves in a difficult position. As the most powerful
                  military force among the villagers, the Hidatsas were essential for American
                  policy. At the same time, Hidatsa raids against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and other western tribes endangered not only federal Indian
                  policy but the immediate security of the expedition once it left Fort Mandan. All
                  these considerations called for closer ties with the Hidatsa villages. But it
                  appeared that those ties would have to be forged at the expense of Mandan good
                  will. This was a knot that no expedition blade could cut. Simply urging a young
                  Hidatsa war chief to abandon a horse-stealing raid on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and calling for peace among the village folk would only
                  produce an illusion of diplomatic progress.<ref target="n0469" n="69"/>
               </p>
               <p> That so much was still unsettled was brought home with great force in the middle
                  of February. On February 14, George Drouillard, Robert Frazer, Silas Goodrich, and
                  John Newman were sent downriver with three horses and sleds to retrieve meat
                  cached from an earlier hunt. Some twenty-five miles from Fort Mandan, the
                  Americans stumbled into the middle of a large Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> raiding party. "Hooping and yelling," the warriors cut the horses
                  from the sleds and "jurked the halters from one to the other through several
                  hands." Two horses, a fine gelding belonging to Charles Mackenzie and a mount in
                  the expedition, were taken by the warriors. The third horse, a grey mare, was
                  returned to the explorers "by the intersetion of an Indian who assumed some
                  authority on the occasion, probably more through fear of himself or some of the
                  Indians being killed by our men who were not disposed to be robed of all they had
                  tamely." It was well after dark when the men finally straggled in to make their
                  unhappy report.</p>
               <p> News that part of the expedition had been attacked by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors who might still be close by galvanized the Americans at
                  Fort Mandan into action. The captains quickly sent two men to the Mandan villages
                  asking for Indian support to chase down the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. About midnight Sheheke, several other chiefs, and a number of
                  older Mandan men arrived at the fort. Explaining that most of the young men in
                  Mitutanka were out hunting and had taken the best guns with them, Sheheke could
                  not offer much in the way of armed support. A few warriors and only two guns
                  proved to be the final Mandan contribution.<ref target="n0470" n="70"/>
               </p>
               <p> At dawn on February 15, Lewis, Ordway, and twenty-some soldiers and Indians left
                  Fort Mandan to pursue the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> raiders. From the beginning it was a mission destined to fail.
                  The weather was bad, the snow deep, and the men soon had their feet cut and
                  bleeding on the sharp ice. As the day wore on, most of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> abandoned the search. They knew the trail was cold and the
                  cause hopeless. Near the end of the day, after some thirty miles of grueling
                  march, Lewis and his men found two abandoned tepees. Exhausted by their journey,
                  the men slept in the tepees overnight. The next day Lewis realized that a
                  continued pursuit of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> was senseless. Until returning to Fort Mandan on February 21, the
                  party conducted a successful hunt, eventually bringing to the fort some 2400
                  pounds of much-needed meat.<ref target="n0471" n="71"/> The meat was a valuable
                  consolation prize, but it only served to remind the captains that their words and
                  weapons had not yet changed Upper Missouri realities. The Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were still their own masters, the Arikaras appeared unreliable
                  and unwilling to abandon their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> trading partners, and the Mandan and Hidatsa villagers seemed
                  bent on squabbling with each other.</p>
               <p> In the wake of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> attack, it was more important than ever for the captains to know
                  just where the Arikaras stood. The raiding party had attempted to implicate
                  Arikaras in the assault on Drouillard and his men by leaving behind some telltale
                  kernels of Arikara corn. Although the captains saw through this ruse, the need for
                  accurate information about Arikara sentiments was even more urgent than it had
                  been in November when Tabeau and Gravelines were asked to investigate the
                  question. It was not until the end of February that the results of their inquiry
                  became known. On February 28, Gravelines, two French engagés, and some
                  Indians came up from the Grand River with a letter from Tabeau. Although the text
                  of the letter has not survived, Clark's summary of it indicates that at least some
                  of the news was reassuring. Tabeau reported that the Arikaras had nothing but
                  "peaceable dispositions" toward the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas. He closed by noting the supposed intention of the
                  Arikaras to abandon their Grand River villages and live in the Knife River region.
                  This move, Tabeau explained, would make an alliance against the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> much easier to sustain. When the explorers told several Mandan
                  chiefs of the Arikara plans, the Indians declared that "they had always wished to
                  be at peace and good neighbors with the Recaras, and it is also the sentiments of
                  all the Big Bellies and Shoe nations." The reply must have further pleased the
                  captains, although the Mandans' sincerity in welcoming the Arikaras as neighbors
                  again was questionable.</p>
               <p> If Lewis and Clark were relieved to hear Tabeau's news, they were anything but
                  pleased to hear the more ominous and realistic evaluation of the tribal situation
                  from Gravelines. He had heard that the Sisseton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and three of the Teton bands intended "to come to war in a short
                  time against the nations in this quarter and will kill every white man they see."
                  Ordway, who heard Gravelines' report, understood that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> saw the Americans as "bad medicine." While the Frenchman
                  explained that neither Black Buffalo's band of Brulé <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> nor the Arikaras were part of the threat, enough Indians were
                  supposedly involved to give the captains more than a moment of real concern. Gass
                  described the expedition's fears with characteristic bluntness. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, wrote Gass, were preparing "to massacre the whole of us in the
                     Spring."<ref target="n0472" n="72"/>
               </p>
               <p> The accuracy of Gravelines' prediction of a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> attack on Fort Mandan and the surrounding villages cannot be
                  known. There was no doubt that many Tetons saw Lewis and Clark as a dangerous
                  force. The Americans had challenged Teton economic power, threatened by the
                  important Arikara connection, and were attempting to forge a military and
                  commercial alliance against the nomads. There was surely sufficient reason for any
                  number of war parties to move against the expedition. But there is no evidence
                  that such a move was planned by any of the Teton bands. For all the talk of a
                  spring massacre, the captains did not appear to take Gravelines' warning
                  seriously. It may have been that by the end of the winter the diplomatic education
                  of Lewis and Clark was sufficiently advanced so that they knew something about the
                  difference between rumor and reality. More likely, their knowledge that they would
                  leave the region in early spring made the threat less menacing.</p>
               <p> March was the last full month the expedition spent at Fort Mandan. To the daily
                  routine of trading, hunting, and tending the hut fires were now added the
                  time-consuming preparations for the second year of western travel. Canoe builders
                  were busy making four craft while others were checking ropes, clothing, and vital
                  hardware. Ice breaking up in the river and the return of biting gnats were sure
                  signs of spring and the time of departure.</p>
               <p> Preparations were interrupted early in March by the arrival of a Hidatsa
                  delegation. On a cold, windy March morning, as Clark walked up to inspect the
                  canoe builders, he met the Hidatsa-proper chief La Borgne. The chief was surely
                  the most influential of the Hidatsa village leaders, and his apparent refusal to
                  parley with Lewis and Clark throughout the winter was a real defeat for their
                  diplomacy. Le Borgne had made no attempt to hide his disdain for the captains.
                  Charbonneau had reported earlier in the year Le Borgne's barbed sarcasm aimed at
                  the explorers. Taunting the Americans, the chief declared that he would visit Fort
                  Mandan only if the captains would give him their largest flag.<ref target="n0473" n="73"/>
               </p>
               <p> That remark seemed to justify the impression most white travelers on the Upper
                  Missouri had about the Hidatsa chief. Henry M. Brackenridge, calling Le Borgne
                  "one of the most extraordinary men I ever knew," described the chief as "sometimes
                  a cruel and abominable tyrant" who ruled with "unlimited control." Brackenridge's
                  fellow traveler John Bradbury agreed. The English naturalist used words like
                  "monster," "savage" and "ferocious" to portray Le Borgne. Tales relating Le
                  Borgne's violence and strength gained wide currency in the region; Clark told
                  Nicholas Biddle one such story about the chief's murder of a faithless wife. While
                  Le Borgne was unquestionably a man of personal strength and ability, he was
                  neither the tyrant nor the brute presented in the records of those who actually
                  saw little or nothing of him. Alexander Henry the Younger did have much experience
                  with Le Borgne and this trader's observations suggest a very different sort of
                  man. Now in his mid-forties, the Hidatsa chief had become a skilled warrior and
                  astute diplomat. Under his leadership the Hidatsas had made important trade
                  alliances with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> while gaining considerable advantage over the Mandan
                  villages. During July 1806, Henry watched with admiration as Le Borgne pursued
                  complex negotiations with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> bands. "He does everything," wrote the trader, "in a composed,
                  deliberate, and cool manner."<ref target="n0474" n="74"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although it is now unclear what sort of calculation brought Le Borgne to Fort
                  Mandan on March 9, 1805, it was a move the chief would not have taken without
                  careful thought. Because Clark spent much of the day with the canoe builders and
                  later at Rooptahee, just what passed between Le Borgne and Lewis is unknown. It is
                  certainly plain that the chief was shown all the respect due his position and was
                  showered with gifts. Hearing that Le Borgne had not received the presents sent to
                  him after the October 1804 meetings, Lewis made a special point to offer a wide
                  variety of goods, including a shirt, some scarlet cloth, a flag, and a metal
                  gorget. To impress the chief with western technology, Lewis brought out the
                  airgun, the quadrant, and a spyglass, all of which Le Borgne pronounced "Great
                  Medicines." Perhaps the most charming moment of the day came when Le Borgne
                  spotted York standing nearby. The chief had heard about York's blackness from
                  young warriors. Doubting what they had seen, the chief called for York to be
                  brought to him. Thinking that perhaps York's color was paint, Le Borgne spit on
                  his own hand and vigorously rubbed York's skin. When York removed the handkerchief
                  from his head and showed Le Borgne his hair, the chief was astonished and promptly
                  declared that the black man "was of a different species from the whites."</p>
               <p> The meeting with Le Borgne must have seemed strangely anticlimatic. So much had
                  happened over the winter that made the captains need the support or at least the
                  understanding of the Hidatsa chief. But on the vital questions of Upper Missouri
                  diplomacy the expedition's record for March 9 is strangely silent. If Lewis and
                  Clark broached the subject of a villager alliance and trade with St. Louis,
                  perhaps Le Borgne showed no interest in pursuing such matters. Whatever his
                  feelings, Le Borgne made no promises. The two swivel guns fired in his honor at
                  the end of the meeting signaled nothing except the failure of Lewis and Clark's
                  diplomacy to change Hidatsa minds.<ref target="n0475" n="75"/>

            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> When the Mandan winter was nearly over, two incidents occurred that symbolized
                  the experience of that season for both the expedition and its Indian neighbors.
                  Toward the end of March, Lewis and Clark heard that two Hidatsa war parties had
                  left the Knife River villages and a third was soon to depart. It was not the kind
                  of news that would give much comfort or sense of accomplishment to diplomats
                  seeking intertribal peace. Intent on counting coup against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> or other western peoples, the Hidatsa warriors had paid no
                  more than passing attention to proposals so earnestly promoted by the captains.
                  Had the expedition's diplomats carefully checked Hidatsa weapons, they might have
                  been even more dismayed. Many of their war axes probably bore the marks of having
                  been made at the Fort Mandan forge. Hidatsa war parties venturing out this spring,
                  as they had for many springs, were a simple reminder of how little had changed.
                  The much talked-about villager coalition against the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> was still more real in the captains' minds than in the actions of
                  men like Black Cat or Le Borgne. Tensions between Mandan and Hidatsa villagers
                  were certain to flare up once American traders came from St. Louis. Each village
                  would want to corner the market on manufactured goods, just as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> had tried to monopolize the expedition and frighten away
                  potential Hidatsa customers. The future of trade between St. Louis and the Upper
                  Missouri was equally uncertain. How Arikara villages and Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands would react to a flood of goods passing them on the way
                  upriver was unknown. There was no evidence that North West Company men like
                  Larocque were about to concede the northern plains to St. Louis interests. Nor was
                  there any hint that Mandan and Hidatsa Indians were ready to abandon traditional
                  trading partners like the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> for the untried Americans. All the lively and
                  complex issues Lewis and Clark had been talking about with Missouri River Indians
                  since the days of August at the Council Bluff camp were still unresolved.</p>
               <p> But if Lewis and Clark's diplomacy produced few if any of the changes sought by
                  the explorers, it would be misleading to declare the Mandan winter either a
                  failure or a disappointment. In many ways the months at Fort Mandan were both
                  productive and peaceful. During the 1805–1806 winter at Fort Clatsop,
                  surrounded by dampness and subjected to an unending fare of foul elk meat and
                  dried salmon, many in the party would recall the bracing plains climate and tasty
                  diet with considerable nostalgia. Personal relations between explorers and
                  villagers during the Mandan winter were marked by genuine good feeling with only
                  few misunderstandings. Those friendships made it possible for the expedition to
                  spend a winter on the plains with a sense of security unrivaled in the history of
                  North American exploration. That sense of harmony, security, and good spirits can
                  be felt in the last visit Lewis and Clark paid to Black Cat on an unseasonably
                  warm day in early April. Lewis smoked with the Mandan chief "as is their custom,"
                  and when Clark arrived the Mandan presented him with a pair of beautifully
                  decorated moccasins. If the Hidatsa war parties were an unpleasant reminder of
                  unachieved goals, those moccasins symbolized what good neighbors both peoples had
                  been. The simple rituals of hunting, eating, trading, and sleeping together had
                  bound the explorers and villagers together during a Dakota winter. </p>

               <p>The winter at Fort Mandan gave Lewis and Clark their first extended opportunity to
                  fulfill one of the expedition's most important objectives. Jefferson had
                  instructed Lewis in June 1803 to gather, record, and analyze a vast amount of
                  information about the Indians in the West and Pacific Northwest. Although
                  Jefferson's final document did not quite match the complex set of questions about
                  the Indians proposed by his scientific consultants, Lewis and Clark had little
                  doubt that their ethnographic assignment had a high priority. The captains
                  understood that they were to do more than count native noses and list languages.
                  From the beginning of the expedition, virtually every diarist in it diligently
                  recorded all sorts of information about Indian life. But the demands of time and
                  travel made thorough study difficult. It was not until the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> that Lewis and Clark could seriously undertake studies in
                  Indian ethnography.</p>
               <p>Disguised as travelers, traders, missionaries, and explorers, ethnographers were
                  part of the American frontier from its earliest times. They recorded their
                  impresssions of the strange and exotic cultures they encountered, often without
                  fully realizing they were engaged in ethnographic study. These pioneer
                  ethnographers described Indian life on a part-time basis, considering such
                  activity incidental to their primary tasks. They included Jesuit missionaries in
                  Canada, who studied Indian ways in order to save lost souls, and fur merchants,
                  who noted native exchange systems to facilitate future trade operations. As
                  part-time observers of native cultures, Lewis and Clark belonged to a long
                  tradition in North America that included Father Paul Le Jeune, James Adair,
                  Nicolas Perrot, and the captains' contemporaries Alexander Henry the Younger and
                  Zebulon Pike. Everything these men noted about the Indians—clothing, houses,
                  village locations, languages, customs, and economy—they recorded in the
                  service of business enterprise, government policy, or religious zeal. They made no
                  pretense at being scientific observers. As valuable as they are, their
                  ethnographic records are imperfect, incomplete pieces of evidence. It would be
                  unreasonable to expect that Lewis and Clark painted a unified, coherent portrait
                  of any Indian culture. They simply did not think in those terms. But they did
                  leave behind journals and maps that comprise pieces of an intricate puzzle.</p>
               <p>Lewis, Clark, Ordway, and the other journalists in their party were ethnographers,
                  not ethnologists. The distinction is important since it bears directly on how the
                  explorers viewed their work and the results of it. Ethnologists study diverse
                  cultures with an eye toward creating widely applicable concepts of social
                  development and behavior. In this century they have become full-time specialists
                  committed to accurate, objective observation. <ref target="n0501" n="1"/> Lewis
                  and Clark would have understood the modern desire for accuracy but not the passion
                  for impartiality. Only rarely did they assume an air of cool detachment and
                  scientific objectivity in their dealings with the Indians. Disinterested
                  observation was the farthest thing from their minds. Because the captains were
                  confident of their own cultural superiority, they never doubted the wisdom of
                  judging Indians by white standards. For Lewis and Clark, every observation was
                  also a judgment. Those judgments are plain in the explorers' comments about the
                  feisty Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and the sharp Chinook traders. For instance, Patrick
                  Gass could not describe the Mandan practice of feeding buffalo skulls without
                  pausing to damn native superstition. <ref target="n0502" n="2"/> But the captains'
                  confidence did not often become swaggering arrogance—something that cannot
                  be said for those who came later. Fortunately, their cultural biases did not
                  prevent them from asking the right ethnographic questions. Equally fortunate, they
                  had the good sense to write down most Indian answers, including many that seemed
                  bewildering at the time.</p>
               <p>Lewis and Clark began their ethnographic work at Fort Mandan by simplifying and
                  streamlining Jefferson's detailed questions covering seventeen areas of Indian
                  life and culture. Those questions touched on everything from language and law to
                  trade and technology. The expedition was to record what the Indians wore, what
                  they ate, how they made a living, and what they believed in. But long before
                  coming to their winter quarters, Lewis and Clark realized that they would have
                  neither the time nor the linguistic ability to ask all of Jefferson's questions.
                  Their "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" contained nineteen questions that now
                  seemed important to the expedition. Special attention was given to each Indian
                  group's tribal name, location, population, language, and potential for American
                  trade. Questions about religious traditions, medical practices, or cultural values
                  were quietly dropped from the official list. This did not mean the expedition was
                  unwilling to record that sort of data. During the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, journal entries noted creation myths, migration legends,
                  burial practices, and sacred rituals. It does suggest that the captains very
                  sensibly recognized their limitations during the winter and decided to use their
                  time and resources to gather material on the externals of Indian life. They
                  concentrated on how Indians looked but did not give systematic attention to native
                  souls and psyches. Their commitment to externals can be seen in their treatment of
                  Indian architecture. Although the expedition's record contains fine exterior
                  descriptions of tepees, earth lodges, and plank houses, it has little to say about
                  their interiors. Later, artists like Karl Bodmer, George Catlin, and Paul Kane
                  would take us inside those houses.</p>
               <p>Time, circumstances, and talent limited the expedition's study of Indian subjects.
                  The explorers were inquisitive about the world around them, and they had
                  Jefferson's methodical approach to guide them. But the Corps of Discovery was not
                  quite prepared for the vast ethnographic enterprise proposed in the "Estimate."
                  Relying on their good sense, Lewis and Clark used four techniques that had long
                  been the mainstays of North American ethnography. First, the captains directly
                  questioned both Indians and whites, often at great length. Second, they collected
                  objects—everything from Arikara corn and tobacco seeds to a Mandan buffalo
                  skin painting. Third, they reported what could be concluded from firsthand
                  observation. Occasionally, they obtained information a fourth way, by
                  participating with the Indians in hunts, games, or ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Of the four methods used by Lewis and Clark, interviews yielded the most valuable
                  information. Since the fort was within easy walking distance of the two Mandan
                  villages, there were more Mandan informants than Hidatsa ones. Scores of Mandan
                  men and women visited the expedition's quarters for all sorts of reasons, but when
                  it came to ethnographic research the most welcome guests were Black Cat, Sheheke,
                  Little Raven, and two leading men from Mitutanka, Big Man (Ohheenar), an adopted
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref>, and Coal (Shotaharrora), an adopted Arikara. It was
                  very important that these chiefs and "considerable men" be courted and closely
                  questioned. For generations, chiefs and elders had served as tribal historians,
                  committing to memory a whole body of past experience and tradition. <ref target="n0503" n="3"/> Without the help of these men, the Lewis and Clark
                  ethnographic record would have been meager and unreliable. Of the two principal
                  Mandan chiefs, Black Cat was the most valued by the expedition's ethnographers.
                  Lewis characterized Black Cat as a man of "integrety, firmness, inteligence and
                  perspicuety of mind." <ref target="n0504" n="4"/> The chief made at least
                  seventeen visits to Fort Mandan, some lasting many days. During those visits he
                  often related "little Indian aneckd<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>, [anecdotes]."
                     <ref target="n0505" n="5"/> But like the Arikara traditions Clark dismissed as
                  not worth mentioning, many pieces of Mandan history and belief shared by Black Cat
                  were not recorded in the journals. Later in the voyage, when the captains had
                  sharpened their ethnographic skills, they would now and then take time to preserve
                  that sort of priceless detail.</p>
               <p>If there were plenty of Mandan informants, there were far fewer from the Hidatsa
                  villages. As noted earlier, several factors limited the expedition's access to
                  Hidatsa information. Some Hidatsa chiefs, including Le Borgne, were away on winter
                  hunts. More important, there was lasting suspicion and hostility among the
                  Hidatsas, especially in Menetarra, about the intentions and behavior of the
                  American party. Many of them were alarmed by the expedition's weapons and the size
                  of Fort Mandan. Some elders resented what they called the captains' "High sounding
                  language" and several warriors were angered by the explorers' boasts about
                  American military might. Such tensions, often fueled by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>' malicious rumors, kept many Hidatsas away from the fort and
                  made them reluctant to entertain the captains at the Knife River villages.</p>
               <p>The simple fact was that Lewis and Clark desperately needed the Hidatsas'
                  information. The explorers knew that Hidatsa (but not Mandan) raiding parties
                  ranged far west to the slopes of the Rockies. These parties could provide
                  knowledge not only valuable for the second year of the expedition's travel but
                  essential for its ethnographic assignment. Since Hidatsa visitors to Fort Mandan
                  were few, those who did come were given special attention. <ref target="n0506" n="6"/> They included Tatuckcopinreha, chief of the little Awaxawi village, and
                  his neighbor the Awatixa chief Black Moccasin. On one occasion Tatuckcopinreha
                  related "many strange accounts of his nation," but Clark recorded only the bare
                  outlines of recent Awaxawi migrations. <ref target="n0507" n="7"/> Notably absent
                  for most of the winter were any Hidatsa-proper folk from Le Borgne's village. Not
                  until the end of the season did the chief and one of his brothers pay court at
                  Fort Mandan—Le Borgne to hear about American diplomacy and his brother to
                  repeat Hidatsa words for an expedition vocabulary. Although the Hidatsa contacts
                  were few, they did yield significant information. From them, Lewis and Clark
                  learned about the size and locations of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>, and Blue Mud (<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref>) Indians. <ref target="n0508" n="8"/> Without Hidatsa
                  cooperation, however grudgingly given, there would have been substantial gaps in
                  the expedition's ethnography.</p>
               <p>Throughout the winter there were other important interviews with Indians who were
                  neither <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> nor Hidatsas. Black Cat brought in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> band chief Chechank, or Old Crane, to talk with
                  Lewis and Clark, thereby expanding their knowledge of northern peoples and trade
                  routes. There were also a number of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> in the Mandan villages who perhaps told the captains about
                  tribes to the West and Southwest. And of course there was the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> woman Sacagawea, whose contribution is simply impossible to
                  verify. It seems more likely that whatever Lewis and Clark knew about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> came from Hidatsa sources. <ref target="n0509" n="9"/>
               </p>
               <p>In all these talks the central problem remained language translation. Charles
                  Mackenzie, a North West Company trader who lived in Black Moccasin's village
                  during the winter of 1804–1805, left some vivid impressions of those
                  difficulties in communicating. Mackenzie recalled watching Lewis and Clark
                  struggle to record a Hidatsa vocabulary in which each word had to pass along a
                  cumbersome translation chain stretching from a native speaker through Sacagawea,
                  Charbonneau, Jusseaume, and on to members of the expedition. Heated arguments
                  among the various translators were frequent, slowing the whole process and
                  worrying many Indians. The way Mackenzie remembered it, "The Indians could not
                  well comprehend the intention of recording their words, [so] they concluded that
                  the Americans had a wicked design on their country." <ref target="n0510" n="10"/>
               </p>
               <p>Fortunately, Lewis and Clark encountered no such language barriers in their
                  conversations with white traders living in the villages around Fort Mandan.
                  Traders and explorers spent a good deal of time with each other that winter,
                  enjoying friendship and sharing information. Although there was some passing
                  tension when North West Company employees were suspected of spreading
                  anti-American rumors among the Hidatsas, Mackenzie insisted that "we lived
                  contentedly and became intimate with the gentlemen of the American expedition, who
                  on all occasions seemed happy to see us, and always treated us with civility and
                  kindness." <ref target="n0511" n="11"/> Their specific ethnographic contributions
                  cannot always be traced in the expedition's record, but it is plain that men like
                  Mackenzie, Jusseaume, Charbonneau, Larocque, and Heney provided much material for
                  the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" and Clark's 1805 map of western North
                  America. The explorers were especially impressed with Heney's experience and
                  knowledge. This trader had spent many years among Upper Missouri and Upper
                  Mississippi peoples and seemed quite ready to share his experience with the
                  captains. They questioned him closely about Upper Mississippi tribes and the many
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands.<ref target="n0512" n="12"/> Heney's imprint is clearly on
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Chippewa.xml"
                       rend="box">Chippewa</ref> sections of their "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." Other
                  North West Company men like Larocque and Mackenzie offered their personal
                  observations on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> and Cree Indians. And despite his unsavory
                  reputation, Jusseaurne did have the kind of firsthand information the expedition
                  needed. Some of the most valuable comments in the journals about Mandan beliefs
                  and intertribal relations came from him.<ref target="n0513" n="13"/>
               </p>
               <p>Because formal interviews demanded both time and translation, much ethnographic
                  information came from personal observation. While always seeing and evaluating
                  through non-Indian eyes, the Americans usually managed to record what they
                  witnessed with considerable accuracy. The expedition's ethnographers were
                  especially interested in observing and setting down details of Indian material
                  culture. What fascinated them were the ordinary things of Indian
                  life—clothing, weapons, food, and houses. During the Mandan winter, Lewis,
                  Clark, and Ordway made important observations on Upper Missouri native life. A
                  look at their distinctive contributions can help chart the growing sophistication
                  of their ethnography.</p>
               <p>Clark's observation was sharpened by his growing skills as a frontier diplomat and
                  negotiator. Although the future St. Louis superintendent of Indian affairs
                  sometimes found time to record the presence of a Mandan sun dance post or a
                  Hidatsa migration story, his real interest was what might be called political
                  ethnography. He wanted to know who had formal political and military power, the
                  ways that power was exercised, and how it was passed from generation to
                  generation. Whenever possible, Clark questioned both Indians and whites about
                  native leadership. But when that was not possible, he relied on his own eyes. He
                  carefully watched Indians such as Black Cat and Sheheke for clues in their
                  behavior that might reveal the patterns of Indian polity.</p>
               <p>Interested in the etiquette of Indian politics and diplomacy, Clark quickly
                  recognized the role of tobacco and smoking in all decision-making. Tobacco was, he
                  wrote, "an article indispenceable in those cases."<ref target="n0514" n="14"/>
                  When the explorer took part in discussions with chiefs and elders, he was careful
                  to record the ritual procedures that dominated all native councils. Clark had been
                  a perceptive political observer from the beginning of the voyage, although in many
                  cases his perceptions were not translated into diplomatic action. By the first
                  winter, he had grasped the fundamentals of Indian diplomacy as well as any veteran
                  of northern plains life. After visiting Black Cat at the end of October 1804, he
                  painstakingly described the protocol of the meeting with its rituals of smoking,
                  proper seating, and the placing of a buffalo robe over his shoulders.<ref target="n0515" n="15"/> Behind Clark's recording of such observations was an
                  intensely practical motive. Future American diplomats in the West would need to
                  know Indian ways just as the French and English had had to bend their diplomatic
                  manners to suit the requirements of the Hurons and Iroquois.<ref target="n0516" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p>Although there are many traces of Clark's political observations scattered
                  throughout his winter journal entries, his ability to understand native politics
                  was best expressed in notes taken by Nicholas Biddle. In answer to Biddle's
                  general question about Mandan and Hidatsa chiefs, Clark offered a long summary of
                  his political observations. "The throne of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>," he explained, "generally descends from the chief to his son
                  if he is able, or promises to be able to direct the military movements of
                  warriors." Unlike so many other non-Indian observers, Clark did not suggest that
                  the "throne of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>" assumed some sort of coercive power over ordinary villagers.
                  Grasping the essential reality of Indian leadership on the northern plains, he
                  realized that "the power of the chief is rather the influence of character than
                  the force of authority." Clark found that chiefs could not become petty tyrants
                  without incurring the disapproval of others equally powerful. "Power," he wrote,
                  "is merely the acquiescence of the warriors in the superior merit of a chief "
                  Extensive observation had taught him that Indian decisions on everything from war
                  to individual transgressions were reached after careful, often time-consuming
                  deliberation in council. Clark told Biddle, "The chief does nothing without
                  consulting the old men." He noted that the council was "formed not by appointment,
                  but the most respectable old men are asked for their advice."<ref target="n0517" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p>Clark's observations and questions did not reveal that ownership of important
                  tribal bundles as well as military prowess was essential for chiefs. And he did
                  assume incorrectly that there was one Mandan nation with a single Grand Chief. But
                  those shortcomings aside, Clark proved to be an astute observer of the chiefs, the
                  councils, and the polity they represented. Unlike most Europeans who insisted on
                  imposing their notions of coercive leadership on native cultures, he got the
                  fundamentals right.<ref target="n0518" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p>If Clark's observations were directed toward studying public politics, the sharp
                  eyes of Sergeant John Ordway were consistently drawn to the commonplace in Indian
                  life. Ordway's journal is filled with notes on those ordinary objects and actions
                  that characterized Upper Missouri Indian cultures. The sergeant was never
                  systematic in his observations. He simply looked at and wrote about what seemed
                  unusual or interesting to him. Blessed with an inquisitive mind, a good
                  vocabulary, and a clear writing style, young Ordway set down those telling details
                  ignored by others. One of his habits throughout the journey was to do some
                  informal exploring on his own, poking and probing around Indian villages to
                  satisfy his curiosity. On one such jaunt early in the winter, Ordway examined and
                  described Mandan burial practices. With an accuracy that rivals George Catlin's
                  later painting of the same subject, the explorer explained that "the form of these
                  savages burying their dead is after they have deceased they fix a Scaffel on
                  raised 4 forks about 8 or 10 feet from the ground. " Ordway noted that corpses
                  were wrapped in buffalo robes and placed on top of the burial scaffolds. Without
                  mentioning the skull circles observed later by Catlin and Prince Maximilian,
                  Ordway correctly noted the location of burial grounds outside village palisades.
                  He also made a telling observation about Indian mourning practices: "When any of
                  them loose a particklor friend or relation they morn and cry for some time
                     after."<ref target="n0519" n="19"/>
               </p>
               <p>On subsequent visits to Mandan villages, Ordway took note of Indian cooking and
                  food preservation. The Mandan diet of beans, corn, squash, and meat appealed to
                  him, and in his simple style he reported that the Indians "live very well."
                  Methods of storing food also attracted his attention. Villagers had long
                  constructed elaborate underground bell-shaped food caches to preserve corn, beans,
                  sunflower seeds, and dried squash over the winter. When Ordway accompanied
                  Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor's detail assigned to obtain corn at Black Cat's village,
                  he observed that large amounts of corn were taken out of the underground pit.<ref target="n0520" n="20"/>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps Ordway's most arresting ethnographic observation during the winter with
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> was a description of one of the most popular games
                  played throughout Indian North America. Known as the game of hoop and pole, the
                  sport was found among almost every Indian group north of Mexico. Although there
                  was considerable diversity in equipment and scoring, the game basically involved
                  hurling a spear or shooting an arrow at a hoop or ring. Scoring depended on the
                  accuracy of the strike toward the ring. Among the Upper Missouri villages the game
                  called for a large cleared, level playing space, long sticks with thongs to catch
                  in the target rings, and flat clay targets. Because the long throwing sticks
                  looked like billiard cues, later white observers insisted that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas played billiards.</p>
               <p>On a cold, stormy day in mid-December 1804, Ordway and two friends made their way
                  to the Mandan villages for some corn trading. Despite the inclement weather, the
                  Americans found a number of chiefs and warriors outside playing the hoop and pole
                  game. Ordway wrote the following account of the game: <hi rend="blockquote">They
                     had feattish [flattish] rings made out of clay Stone &amp; two men had Sticks
                     about 4 feet long with 2 Short peaces across the fore end of it, and neathing
                     on the other end, in Such a manner that they would Slide Some distance. They
                     had a place fixed across about 50 yards to the 2 chiefs lodge, which was Smothe
                     as a house flour. They had a Battery fixed for the rings to Stop against. Two
                     men would run at a time with Each a Stick &amp; one carried a ring. They run
                     about half way and then Slide their Sticks after the ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> Ordway was interested enough to want to play the game, but his efforts were
                  thwarted when he could not understand the scoring system.<ref target="n0521" n="21"/>
               </p>
               <p>Even the most casual reader of the Lewis and Clark record soon learns that Lewis
                  was the expedition's most skillful observer of Indian material culture. He
                  probably kept a full journal during the winter, but only a few sheets of it have
                     survived.<ref target="n0522" n="22"/> Those few scraps reveal an astute
                  observer of Indian life. Three of his observations show his growing skill as an
                  ethnographer.</p>
               <p>One entry concerns the brisk trade in war hatchets that developed between the
                  villagers and the Fort Mandan forge, which gave Lewis an opportunity to study
                  battle-axe styles used by the warriors. He described the weapon as a thin, iron
                  blade "from 7 to nine iches in length and from 4 ¾ to 6 inches on its edge,
                  from whence the sides proceed nearly in a straight line to the eye where its width
                  is generally not more than an inch." Mounted on a handle some fourteen inches
                  long, the whole weapon weighed about a pound. Lewis found the weapon's blow
                  "uncertain and easily avoided." The American soldier was even less impressed with
                  earlier versions of the instrument. This precise description of the axe was
                  accompanied by a quick but accurate sketch of the weapon.<ref target="n0523" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p>In March 1805, Lewis had the chance to observe French trader Joseph Gravelines
                  demonstrate an important Indian industrial process: the intricate means Arikara
                  craftsmen used to make glass beads. The Frenchman indicated that the Arikaras
                  learned the skill from <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> prisoners, but Tabeau heard from his Arikara friends that the
                  process came to them from a "Spanish prisoner," perhaps an Indian held captive
                  somewhere in the Southwest and traded up to the Grand River villages. As
                  Gravelines went slowly through the steps, Lewis watched intently and probably took
                  ample notes. From those notes and his own memory he was able to write a remarkably
                  graphic and precise description of glass bead-making. That description included
                  not only the steps in the process but the materials and equipment necessary for a
                  successful result. Not satisfied with simply recounting the molding, firing, and
                  tempering techniques, Lewis also noted how the beads were used. "The Indians," he
                  explained, "are extreemly fond of the large beads formed by this process. They use
                  them as pendants to their years [ears], or hair and sometimes wear them about
                  their necks."<ref target="n0524" n="24"/>
               </p>
               <p>Lewis's third ethnographic observation came at the end of the Fort Mandan season
                  as the expedition was preparing for its second year of travel. To provide shelter
                  for themselves, the interpreters, Sacagawea, and her child Jean Baptiste, the
                  captains purchased a buffalo skin tepee. The expedition had seen tepees early in
                  the journey among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands; Lewis now wrote one of the best descriptions yet drafted
                  of that distinctive plains dwelling. <quote>This tent is in the Indian stile,
                     formed of a number of dressed Buffaloe skins in such manner that when foalded
                     double it forms the quarter of a circle, and is left open at one side. Here it
                     may be attatached or loosened at pleasure by strings which are sewed to its
                     sides for the purpose. To erect this tent, a parsel of ten or twelve poles are
                     provided, fore or five of which are attatched together at one end, they are
                     then elivated and their lower extremities are spread in a circular manner to a
                     width proportionate to the demention of the lodge; in the same position orther
                     poles are leant against those, and the leather is then thrown over them forming
                     a conic figure.<ref target="n0525" n="25"/>
                  </quote> Sometimes burdened with an
                  overblown vocabulary and an ornate style, Lewis was nonetheless well on his way to
                  becoming the expedition's premier ethnographer. He had neither Clark's talent for
                  political analysis nor Ordway's penchant for the homey detail. He did have the
                  naturalist's ability to describe objects with almost photographic fidelity. Lewis
                  brought to ethnography the practiced eye of one who delighted in describing and
                  cataloging the creatures of the natural world.</p>
               <p>From their earliest travels in the Americas, Europeans collected and sometimes
                  stole what seemed to them attractive Indian souvenirs. At first those artifacts
                  were seen as mere curiosities, conversation pieces for princes and merchants. But
                  by the eighteenth century such "cabinets of curiosities" had become the core of
                  serious scientific collections of ethnological specimens. Jefferson shared that
                  impulse to assemble and analyze objects from cultures throughout the world. Just
                  as the Royal Society instructed Capt. James Cook to gather representative samples
                  of South Pacific material culture, so did Jefferson urge his captains to collect
                  articles typical of Indian life along the route.</p>
               <p>Most of the expedition's collecting reflected Lewis's interest in natural history
                  as well as Jefferson's desire to catalog the plants, animals, and mineral
                  resources of the newly acquired territories. Despite a focus on the land and its
                  products, there was time to gather some Indian objects. On April 3, 1805, as the
                  expedition was making final preparations for leaving Fort Mandan, Clark drafted a
                  list of all those specimens and samples sent back to St. Louis with Warfington's
                  keelboat crew. Among the boxes, trunks, and cages were a number of objects
                  illustrating Indian life. Knowing Jefferson's interest in scientific agriculture,
                  the explorers included a generous sample of the produce of Upper Missouri
                  villagers. Arikara tobacco seeds, a carrot of their distinctive tobacco, and an
                  ear of Mandan corn were the captains' harvest for the gardener of Monticello.
                  Clothing was also included in the Indian collection sent downriver. Four buffalo
                  robes and "some articles of Indian dress" wrapped in a Hidatsa robe were placed in
                  the second numbered box to show the curious back home something of native
                  fashion.</p>
               <p>That second box also contained the most arresting object collected during the
                  winter. On a large buffalo skin a Mandan artist had portrayed in vivid detail a
                  1797 battle between Arikara-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> raiders and Mandan-Hidatsa warriors. Warfare was further
                  represented by a Mandan bow and quiver of arrows. The bow is the only object in
                  the assembly whose provenance can be traced in the expedition's journals. Early in
                  February 1805, Lewis paid a social call on Black Cat. During the visit he was
                  presented with a bow by the Mandan chief, most likely the same bow sent along with
                  some arrows in the St. Louis-bound boxes. Rounding out the Indian collection was a
                  Mandan clay pot "used for culinary purposes."<ref target="n0526" n="26"/>
               </p>
               <p>A review of the Indian objects collected by the expedition reenforces the
                  impresssion that the explorers were bent on studying the externals of native life.
                  Weapons, clothing, pottery, seeds, and a skin depicting a battle all suggest what
                  Lewis and Clark thought was important for understanding villager ways. Nothing was
                  sent back to reveal the rich ceremonial life in Mandan and Hidatsa towns. For the
                  pragmatic Americans more interested in natural resources than in supernatural
                  practices, collecting seeds made more sense than trying to get Indians to part
                  with pieces of ritual paraphernalia. What emerged from the Mandan winter
                  collection was a perception of the village Indians as warriors and farmers. It
                  would take nineteenth-century artists like George Catlin and Karl Bodmer and
                  explorers like Prince Maximilian to broaden that narrow image.</p>
               <p>Much of the winter of 1804-1805 was a shared experience with Indian neighbors.
                  With so many friendly villages close at hand, it was natural that both explorers
                  and natives should participate in all sorts of activities. From formal rituals and
                  largescale hunts to more intimate encounters, the expedition's members learned
                  about Indians by living parts of villager culture. Because the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas did not schedule major rituals like the creation
                  drama called the Okipa during the winter, the explorers did not witness those
                  powerful ceremonies. However, the Americans did participate in the buffalo-calling
                  rites during January 1805 and saw a Mandan war medicine dance the same month.</p>
               <p>Excluded by the calendar from the important public rituals, the explorers did gain
                  much information about Indian life by taking part in less spectacular but perhaps
                  more typical events. On a hunting trip with Sheheke, Lewis observed the plains
                  custom of marking ownership of downed animals. As he related it to Clark, buffalo
                  carcasses without identifying arrows in them could be claimed by anyone needing
                     meat.<ref target="n0527" n="27"/> From eating in earth lodges the explorers
                  learned about village menus and food preparation. Participation in some aspects of
                  Indian daily life did not mean that the Americans changed their own cultural
                  identity. But sharing some of the joys, troubles, and labor of a Dakota winter did
                  give the expedition's ethnographers a sense of authority when they wrote about
                  Indian life.</p>
               <p>Lewis and Clark did not gather information out of idle curiosity. Although never
                  attempting any complete picture of village life, they gave purpose and method to
                  their ethnographic enterprise. That methodology can be best seen in their
                  "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." More than random entries in their journals, the
                  "Estimate" was the showpiece of their ethnography. Drafted by Lewis and Clark
                  during the winter, the document was a massive effort to organize and compare data
                  on nearly fifty tribes and bands. In concept and design it was as scientific as
                  expedition ethnography ever got. Organized in tabular form and structured around
                  nineteen questions, the "Estimate" recorded such things as tribal names, location,
                  population, languages, and potential for American trade. Although Lewis and Clark
                  composed an "Estimate of the Western Indians" during the winter at Fort Clatsop,
                  that later document was not nearly as intricate or comprehensive.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The "Estimate" and its questions sprang in part from the explorers' own efforts to
                  pare down the lists of complex questions proposed by Jefferson and Rush. But the
                  document was more than an expedient response to dwindling time and short
                  abilities. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment stressed the careful gathering and
                  thoughtful comparison of all knowledge. Learning needed to be practical, as the
                  American Philosophical Society recognized when it dedicated itself to "Promoting
                  Useful Knowledge." And in that age of encyclopedias, information required
                  organization in order to be useful. The chapter organization and comparative
                  charts in Jefferson's <hi rend="italic">Notes on the State of Virginia</hi> may
                  have been the progenitor of Lewis and Clark's "Estimate."</p>
               <p>Typical of the informants Lewis and Clark sought out for the "Estimate" were two
                  Indians, Greasy Head and an unnamed Arikara, who came to Fort Mandan early in
                  March 1805 and "gave some account of the Indians near the rockey Mountains." Hugh
                  Heney provided "the names and charecktors of the Seeaux" and the Chippewas. From
                  Mandan and Hidatsa contacts came information on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"

                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> Indians. Reaching back to their days near St. Louis, the
                  explorers used traders' information on the three <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Pawnee.xml"
                       rend="box">Pawnee</ref> divisions as well as the Iowa and Osage peoples. Clark's careful
                  list of Indians who traded with the Arikara villages proved invaluable when
                  filling out the sections dealing with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Arapaho.xml"

               </p>
               <p>All that questioning, analyzing, and comparing produced accurate data about the
                  names, numbers, and locations of Indians from the western Great Lakes to the
                  Continental Divide, and from the Canadian plains to north Texas. What Lewis and
                  Clark wanted, at least during the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, was a kind of statistical geography of those tribes they had
                  already met, those yet to be encountered, and those who might influence United
                  States Indian policy. And that is really what the "Estimate of the Eastern
                  Indians" proved to be—a limited but practical document for government agents
                  and fur traders.</p>
               <p>Although the "Estimate" was the key document produced by the expedition's
                  ethnographers during the Mandan season, other records from that period contained
                  information about the Indians. Thomas Jefferson, who had long been interested in
                  Indian languages, provided the captains with blank vocabulary sheets as a means to
                  collect and preserve native words and phrases. Clark told Nicholas Biddle that
                  great care was exercised in getting each sound properly recorded. Writing years
                  after the expedition Jefferson declared that Lewis "never miss[ed] an opportunity
                  of taking a vocabulary." The trader Charles Mackenzie verified the explorers'
                  commitment to language study, noting their struggles to capture words translated
                  through several speakers. Knowing just how tense relations were between the
                  American party and the Hidatsas-proper makes the expedition's successful effort to
                  obtain a vocabulary from one of Le Borgne's brothers a genuine accomplishment. All
                  told, the captains gathered some fourteen word lists to be sent downriver at the
                  end of the winter. One of the lasting tragedies was that all that work was lost or
                  misplaced after the expedition returned.<ref target="n0530" n="30"/>
               </p>
               <p>Although those lost lists cannot be studied for their linguistic content, it is
                  important to recognize the sorts of words and phrases sought out by the
                  expedition. Reflecting Jefferson's commitment to useful knowledge, the blank
                  vocabularies reveal a set of some 315 words needed for simple conversations
                  between Indians and traders or government officials. The explorers were to gather
                  classes of words ranging from Indian equivalents for simple numbers to the names
                  of common animals. Names of the seasons, kinds of trees and plants, labels for
                  family relationships, and words for basic human emotions were all to be included
                  in the collecting process. Neither so utilitarian as the simple trading phrase
                  vocabularies written by Hudson's Bay Company employees nor so complex as the
                  dictionaries compiled later in the century by linguists working for the Bureau of
                  American Ethnology, the Lewis and Clark vocabularies represent an attempt to
                  gather information useful to men of science, government, and business.<ref target="n0531" n="31"/>
               </p>
               <p>Most of the ethnographic data collected by the expedition was recorded in journal
                  entries, the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians," and the now-lost vocabularies. But
                  there were two additional sources of Indian information, which bring to light
                  important aspects of native life as well as the fundamental contribution made by
                  Indians to the expedition. Throughout the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, Clark carefully gathered material in order to draw a large map
                  of western America he called a "Connection of the Countrey." Writing in his
                  journal on January 7, 1805, Clark reported that he was busy drafting "a connected
                  plott from the information of Traders, Indians &amp; my own observation &amp;
                  ideas." One historical geographer has called Clark's map "the foremost" result of
                  the period of information gathering and analysis, while a specialist in historical
                  cartography has described it as "one of the most significant maps produced by the
                     expedition."<ref target="n0532" n="32"/>
               </p>
               <p>Usually noted as an example of the way Lewis and Clark pictured the West before
                  leaving Fort Mandan, the map also contained important tribal locations and
                  population estimates. How Clark obtained such Indian ethnographic and geographic
                  information and how he fitted that data into his own mental framework amount to a
                  unique cultural confrontation. His cartography also suggests the Indians' views of
                  their own physical environment as well as their ways of conveying those views to
                  strangers. Just how much information about the proposed route from Fort Mandan to
                  the mountains came from Indian sources can be judged by another
                  document—Lewis's "Summary View of the Rivers and Creeks which discharge
                  themselves into the Missouri." Composed during the winter of 1804-1805, this
                  detailed study of rivers and streams between St. Louis and the Continental Divide
                  is often cited as further evidence of the expedition's skill at gathering and
                  analyzing a mass of geographic data. At the same time, a careful reading of the
                  document reveals both the amount and quality of geographic knowledge available
                  from the Indians around Fort Mandan.</p>
               <p>Histories of North American exploration have often slighted the role of the
                  Indians as suppliers of essential information to white explorers. Undue attention
                  to the supposed efforts of Sacagawea to "guide" Lewis and Clark has tended to
                  obscure the vital contributions of Mandan and Hidatsa mapmakers to the American
                  enterprise. During the months of December and January, as Clark was hard at work
                  on his western map, three important Indian-mapping sources became available to
                  him. On December 17, he got from Heney "some sketches which he had obtained from
                  the Indians to the West of this place." Just who those western Indians were or
                  what information was contained in those sketches is not clear from the surviving
                  evidence. However, Heney was highly regarded by the captains and any data he had
                  from Indian sources was bound to get serious consideration. Early in January, as
                  Clark continued work on his map, the Mandan chief Sheheke visited the fort and
                  provided more valuable information. Sheheke gave Clark "a Scetch of the Countrey
                  as far as the high Mountains, &amp; on the south Side of the River Rejone
                  [Yellowstone]." The chief explained that six small rivers emptied into the
                  Yellowstone on the south, that the land was hilly and heavily timbered, and that
                  there were "Great numbers of beaver." Guided by Sheheke's words or perhaps his
                  drawing, Clark drafted a map of the Yellowstone from its confluence with the
                  Missouri to its assumed headwaters somewhere in the Rockies.<ref target="n0533" n="33"/>
               </p>
               <p>The "sketches" provided by Heney and Sheheke may not have been visual
                  representations but rather verbal descriptions of lands and rivers toward the
                  mountains. On January 16 the expedition did receive an unmistakably Indian map
                  from a visiting Hidatsa chief. "This war chief," wrote Clark, "gave us a Chart in
                  his way of the Missourie." Because Hidatsa raiders had personal knowledge of lands
                  and peoples up to and sometimes beyond the Continental Divide, Lewis and Clark
                  always placed high value on their reports. But Clark's phrase "a Chart in his way"
                  hints at both the means the Hidatsa cartographer chose to construct his map and
                  the problems the American explorer had in interpreting it.</p>
               <p>As Clark explained later to Biddle, Indian maps came in several shapes and forms.
                  Some were flat drawings made on skins or mats while others were three-dimensional
                  relief maps made in sand, "hills designated by raising sand, rivers by hollow
                  etc." Although it is not certain which method had been employed in making this
                  Hidatsa map, there was no doubt that working with it posed serious problems.
                  Accustomed to dealing with flat maps having North at the top, locations plotted by
                  latitude and longitude, and distances measured in miles, Clark must have found the
                  Hidatsa map bewildering. Both Indians and whites made maps, but the interests of
                  those peoples and their cartographic conventions were quite different. Indian
                  mapmakers often oriented their maps along sunrise and sunset lines or toward the
                  direction of travel. Distances were measured in terms of travel time while
                  directions were expressed in words such as above and below. Because Indians mapped
                  what was important to them, the concerns of the expedition must have sometimes
                  appeared strange or illogical. Used to travel overland by horse, plains people
                  found it difficult to answer questions about the heads of navigation on the
                  Missouri and other rivers. Lines drawn in the sand might mean creeks, game trails,
                  or often-used war routes. Language itself compounded the problem. Simple
                  prepositions such as <hi rend="italic">to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">from</hi>
                  could be crucial in explaining the direction of a river's flow. The shape of the
                  Hidatsa map, its unfamiliar conventions, and the cultural assumptions behind it
                  must have challenged Clark's abilities. That the explorer and the Indian were
                  willing to attempt such communication across an especially treacherous cultural
                  divide testifies to the skill and persistence of both men.<ref target="n0534" n="34"/>
               </p>
               <p>It was easier for Clark to fix tribes and villages on his own western map than to
                  interpret native charts. In many ways Clark's 1805 map was a visual statement of
                  the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." The peoples classified and tabulated in the
                  "Estimate" were located spatially on Clark's map. From his vantage point at the
                  Mandan villages, the explorer looked north and properly located the several <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> and Cree bands in what is now Manitoba and
                  Saskatchewan. Farther to the North and West, in northern Montana and Saskatchewan,
                  he correctly placed two of the Blackfeet divisions, the Bloods and the Siksikas.
                  On the North Saskatchewan River, Clark precisely spotted the Sarsi Indians.
                  Turning west, he accurately recorded the locations and populations of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref>, Comanche, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"

                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> Indians. Drawing on information from Hidatsa sources, he noted
                  the important links between the Hidatsas and the River <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crows</ref>. Recognizing the distant travels of Hidatsa warriors, Clark took
                  pains to trace "the war path of the Big Bellies" from the Knife River villages,
                  along the Missouri, across the mountains, and on to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> Indians in the present-day Bitterroot Valley in Montana.<ref target="n0535" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p>While Clark was occupied in recording Indian information on his map, Lewis was
                  gathering equally significant native data to incorporate in his compilation of
                  Missouri River waterways and prominent geographical features. For his description
                  of the creeks and rivers flowing into the Missouri between St. Louis and Fort
                  Mandan, Lewis could rely on the expedition's firsthand experience. But for details
                  beyond the mouth of the Knife River, the explorer admitted that "the subsequent
                  description of this river [the Missouri], and its subsidiary streams are taken
                  altogether from Indian information." Convinced that such information was "entitled
                  to some confidence," Lewis nonetheless was careful to explain that he and Clark
                  had closely questioned natives during the entire winter, compared their answers,
                  and accepted only those that could be cross-checked. What came from mostly Hidatsa
                  sources was a remarkably accurate picture of the Missouri River from the Great
                  Bend to its headwaters. But just as the Indians' different cultural perceptions
                  made mapping from their data difficult, so did those same problems distort Lewis's
                  analysis. Nowhere was that distortion more evident than in the ways explorers and
                  Indians understood the nature of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_GreatFalls.xml"
                       rend="box">Great Falls</ref> of the Missouri. The Indians' description was especially
                  vivid, telling of the power and thunderous sound of the falls. But because Hidatsa
                  warriors had no experience carrying heavy boats and cumbersome luggage around the
                  falls, they reported that the portage was "not greater than half a mile." As it
                  turned out, the expedition struggled over a bruising eighteen-mile route around
                  the falls. Despite misunderstandings about the identity of the Marias River, the
                  nature of the Great Falls portage, a purported easy passage over the Continental
                  Divide, and the imagined south fork of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Columbia.xml"
                       rend="box">Columbia</ref> River just over the divide, the Indians' information proved
                  not only accurate but invaluable.<ref target="n0536" n="36"/>
               </p>
               <p>To evaluate Lewis and Clark's ethnographic contributions, three related questions
                  ought to be posed. First, what did the explorers see, understand, and accurately
                  record? Determined to study the externals of Indian culture, Lewis and Clark
                  excelled at describing village locations, weapons, food, clothing and other
                  material aspects. Journal accounts of village meals illustrate the point. With
                  obvious relish, Clark described Little Crow's wife stirring "a kettle of boiled
                  Cimnins, beans, corn and choke cherries with the stones." Ordway went further,
                  describing with cookbook accuracy the ingredients and shaping of Indian corn ball
                  bread. The sergeant found that this part of the Indian diet "eats verry well."<ref target="n0537" n="37"/> With a common-sense curiosity that characterized so
                  much of the expedition's ethnography, the explorers observed and tasted the stuff
                  of Indian life.</p>
               <p>On occasion, Lewis and Clark were able to understand and record other aspects of
                  Indian life, including trade, a subject of intense interest to them. Although
                  sometimes confused by Indian notions of what was valuable in an economic exchange,
                  the explorers did comprehend one of the central rituals in intertribal trade.
                  Because Indians who traded at the Mandan and Hidatsa villages were for most of the
                  year potential enemies, or relatives of those killed in combat, means had to be
                  found to forestall possible violence and allow peaceful relations. Reflecting the
                  fundamental Indian social reality that defined relatives as friends and outsiders
                  as enemies, villagers and nomads created a ceremony in which strangers were made
                  temporary, fictional relatives. Men who might later fight each other could for a

               <p>Sieur de la Vérendrye was the first European to record this practice of
                  adoption, reporting that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> Indians who accompanied him asked to be adopted as
                  his "children," thus repeating the formula they had long employed with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. In mid-November 1804, with a large number of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> and Cree Indians camped nearby, Clark took note of
                  "a serimony of adoption, and interchange of property." Relating the process to
                  Nicholas Biddle, Clark explained that "every man of the North makes a <hi rend="italic">comrade</hi> of the Mandan or Ricara with whom he had to deal."
                  An exchange of gifts sealed the adoption, established certain bargaining limits,
                  and signaled the opening of peaceful trade.<ref target="n0539" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a second question equally worth asking. What did the expedition see,
                  record, but not understand? During that long Dakota winter the explorers
                  encountered many things well beyond their own cultural experience. Ritual behavior
                  or social customs often eluded their grasp, especially if they had no counterparts
                  in white American life. Berdaches, those plains Indian men who dressed and acted
                  as women, caught the captains' attention but evaded their understanding. First
                  mentioned by Clark in late December 1804, the berdaches were described as "men
                  dressed in squars clothes." In conversation with Biddle, Clark amplified that
                  original description, adding that young Hidatsa boys showing "any symptoms of
                  effeminacy or girlish inclinations" were raised as women, married men, and
                  fulfilled all the functions assigned to Hidatsa women. But Clark had missed the
                  spiritual nature of the berdache while imposing an interpretation of sexual
                  deviation where none belonged. What he perceived as gender confusion or
                  homosexuality was actually something quite outside his own experience. Men became
                  berdaches not early in life but usually as teenagers or later. The berdache role
                  could be assumed only after a series of dreams from the Holy Woman Above. Only
                  brothers or sons of men owning ceremonial rights to the Woman Above and Holy Woman
                  bundles could become berdaches. After having the required dreams and assuming
                  women's clothing, berdaches were viewed as persons of great and sometimes
                  mysterious spirit power.<ref target="n0540" n="40"/>
               </p>
               <p>The explorers were equally confused by the few native religious rituals they
                  witnessed. One of those was the practice of feeding to buffalo heads or skulls a
                  ceremonial meal. When Gass saw a Mandan offer food to a buffalo head, he ridiculed
                  the devotion, saying, "Their superstitious credulity is so great, that they will
                  believe by using the head well the living buffalo will come and that they will get
                  a supply of meat." After the expedition's hunters killed a buffalo and put its
                  head on the bow of the keelboat, an Indian passing by stopped and spent some time
                  smoking to the buffalo. Asked what he was doing, the man replied that the buffalo
                  was his medicine and required this ritual.<ref target="n0541" n="41"/>
               </p>
               <p>Although the ceremony was accurately described by Gass and Clark, its meaning
                  escaped them. The Americans did not sense the connection Indians made between
                  living things and those apparently dead. Feeding buffalo heads could appease the
                  spirits of dead animals while reassuring those that were to be hunted and killed.
                  Hunters always made a small offering to a skull before beginning the hunt. Buffalo
                  skulls were often included in the most powerful of the medicine bundles. Unaware
                  of the sanction given to buffalo feeding by the buffalo culture hero in the Sacred
                  Arrows myth, the explorers could interpret the practice as only savage
                  superstition or childish fantasy.<ref target="n0542" n="42"/>
               </p>
               <p>One of the rituals of village life most carefully recorded and least understood
                  was the Mandan buffalo-calling ceremony. The open sexuality of the rite certainly
                  attracted some of the American party, but the purpose of that ritual intercourse
                  simply baffled Clark. Several men in the expedition obligingly took part in it,
                  and their experiences enabled Clark to write a remarkably detailed description of
                  buffalo calling. He realized that the ceremony was undertaken to attract the herd
                  and guarantee a successful hunt. But he simply could not fathom how sexual
                  relations between old men or white men and the wives of younger Indians could
                  bring the animals closer and ensure good kills. Admiring much about the Mandan
                  way, Clark found it difficult to reconcile what seemed random promiscuity with his
                  own positive evaluation of village life. He did not understand that northern
                  plains cultures assumed that sexual intercourse was like a pipeline that could
                  transfer spiritual power from one person to another. Old men had that special
                  power and, as Clark himself noted, "the Indians say all white flesh is medisan."
                  Giving their wives to old men or white strangers was a way aspiring young men
                  could appropriate powerful spirit forces for themselves. Nothing in his cultural
                  heritage prepared Clark to comprehend all this, but he had the good sense to make
                  an accurate record of the event. It is important to recall that Clark was not
                  prudish about buffalo calling. He wrote his account in plain English. It was only
                  later that the proper Philadelphian Nicholas Biddle put Clark's forthright words
                  into genteel Latin.<ref target="n0543" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, Lewis and Clark's ethnography needs to be assessed by what the explorers
                  did not see. Since it was the wrong season of the year, they did not witness the
                  awesome Okipa. Because many essential social aspects of native life were
                  culturally invisible to most white outsiders, the captains did not take note of
                  the clans and age-grade societies that gave shape to Upper Missouri Indian life.
                  Some objects were hidden from all strangers: Lewis and Clark neither saw nor wrote
                  about the sacred bundles, the turtle drums, and the ceremonies that surrounded
                  those objects. Just how much Indian religious practice the explorers understood is
                  not clear from the evidence. Clark did write about "medicine" and tried to explain
                  the idea to Biddle by recounting part of a Mandan creation story.<ref target="n0544" n="44"/> But it is doubtful if any member of the expedition
                  understood the plains belief in power or medicine as a tangible force that
                  pervaded all life. Lewis and Clark never saw the interior of the Mandan and
                  Hidatsa universe. That universe—the amalgam of behavior and values that made
                  villagers who they were—was simply beyond the explorers' cultural
                  horizon.</p>
               <p>During the winter at Fort Mandan, Lewis and Clark served their apprenticeships in
                  ethnography. They saw much and recorded most of it in simple, commonsense
                  language. Migration stories, selective prairie burning, and warriors'
                  weapons—all were described in the expedition's record. By the time Lewis and
                  Clark got to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"

               <p> On a windy day in early April 1805, Meriwether Lewis surveyed the Corps of
                  Discovery and its "little fleet" of canoes and pirogues, and declared that the
                  expedition was ready "to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width,
                  on which the foot of civilized man had never trodden." The long months at Fort
                  Mandan now over, Lewis enthusiastically wrote that he "could but esteem this
                  moment of my departure as among the most happy of my life."<ref target="n0601" n="1"/> But even before that long-anticipated move upriver, the explorers had
                  formulated plans and goals that directly involved Indian peoples in the West and
                  Pacific Northwest. Foremost was the need to locate the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> Indians and obtain horses from them. Lewis explained how
                  important those horses were to the expedition's success when he wrote that "the
                  circumstances of the Snake Indians possessing large quantities of horses is much
                  in our favour as by means of horses, the transport of our baggage will be rendered
                  easy and expeditious over land, from the Missouri, to the Columbia river."<ref target="n0602" n="2"/> Led to believe that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> would be encountered somewhere between the Great Falls of the
                  Missouri and the Three Forks, Lewis and Clark made finding them a central goal in
                  the second season of exploration.</p>
               <p> The journey up the Missouri and on to Three Forks necessitated travel through
                  territories frequented by Indians that Lewis and Clark believed were hostile to an
                  American presence. As the expedition left Fort Mandan, its second goal was to
                  avoid the various <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> bands known to hunt along the banks of the
                  Missouri beyond the Great Bend. Branded by the explorers as people with a
                  "turbulent and faithless disposition," the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> were viewed as a potential threat to the
                  expedition's progress. As Lewis explained later in the spring, "We do not wish to
                  see those gentlemen just now."<ref target="n0603" n="3"/>

                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> warriors were tactical goals—ones that
                  needed to be achieved in order to guarantee a successful voyage. But Lewis and
                  Clark always understood that they were more than mere travelers making a grand
                  western tour at government expense. They went west as diplomats and agents of an
                  American empire. Proclaiming United States sovereignty, establishing intertribal
                  peace, and promoting trade with American merchants were unchanging objectives of
                  the expedition. Symbolizing those goals was an unnamed Mandan man who went along
                  with the expedition when it left on April 7. He was on board, explained Lewis,
                  "with a view to restore peace between the Snake Indians and those in this
                     neighbourhood."<ref target="n0604" n="4"/> Although the Mandan peace emissary
                  decided two days later not to hazard the journey, Lewis and Clark were still
                  committed to the policies toward the Indians they had promoted from the
                  outset.</p>
               <p> In the weeks that followed the departure from Fort Mandan, the expedition made
                  good progress against the spring current of the Missouri. Busy navigating the
                  twists and turns of the river channel, they had little time to notice how few
                  Indians were to be seen. An occasional Hidatsa hunting party or abandoned camp was
                  the only reminder of a native presence. Yet the concern over potential trouble
                  with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> haunted the expedition. In mid-April the
                  Americans began to see traces of recent <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> activity; horse tracks and empty hunting camps
                  were worrisome signs, but they did not put the explorers on any special alert.<ref target="n0605" n="5"/> They were far more intent on reaching the Yellowstone
                  confluence. But on April 17, as the expedition was on the Big Bend of the
                  Missouri, its fears about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> seemed justified. At sunset, fresh <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> tracks and four timber rafts were spotted along
                  the river bank. Both Lewis and Clark believed that an <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> war party on its way to raid the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"

                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>, the rest of April proved peaceful. As the
                  explorers passed the Yellowstone confluence and entered present-day Montana, signs
                  of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> and other Indian tribes continued to appear.
                  Stick lodges, hunting camps, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> prayer cloth offerings, and sweat lodges all told
                  that the expedition was not alone on the Upper Missouri.<ref target="n0607" n="7"/> Early in May, when the Americans were in northeastern Montana, increased
                  evidence of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboin</ref> movement once again put Lewis and Clark on guard.
                  On May 8, at the Milk River, the explorers came upon a place "where an Indian had
                  recently grained, or taken the hair off of a goatskin." Lewis's belief that the
                  Indians were <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> and Clark's report of possible smoke and tepees
                  some distance up Milk River convinced the captains that real danger was near.<ref target="n0608" n="8"/> Two days later there was another alarm. During the
                  morning, as the explorers made a brief stop just past Stick Lodge Creek upriver
                  from present-day Fort Peck dam, a dog wandered into the expedition's camp. Taking
                  this to be a sure sign that Indians were close at hand and certain they were <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>, Lewis and Clark sent out hunters "to scower the
                  country." Fearing an attack by Indians Lewis characterized as "a vicious illy
                  disposed nation." the captains set the whole party to checking weapons and
                  ammunition. When the scouts returned and reported no warriors about, the alert
                  ended as quickly as it had come.<ref target="n0609" n="9"/>
               </p>
               <p> For the rest of May and well into June, the expedition's energies were taken up
                  in navigating the river through the Missouri Breaks. Although the Breaks and the
                  White Rocks region offered what Lewis poetically described as "seens of visionary
                  inchantment," there was little time to appreciate such natural wonders. Sandbars,
                  rapids, and falling banks made the task of pulling boats against the current ever
                  more demanding. Struggling toward the Judith River, the explorers continued to
                  note "strong evidences of Indians being on the river above us, and probably at no
                  great distance."<ref target="n0610" n="10"/> More deserted stick lodges, a tepee
                  pole that bore signs of use as part of a travois, and other native goods were
                  steady reminders of the crowded wilderness. On May 29, at the Judith River, there
                  were two vivid marks of Indian life. Walking along the Missouri at a point just
                  above the mouth of the Judith, Lewis counted the fires of 126 recently occupied
                  tepees. Close by, Clark observed the rings of an older tepee encampment numbering
                  some 100 lodges. Once again anxiety about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> surfaced as the captains brought Sacagawea some
                  worn-out moccasins from the sites for her identification. After careful
                  examination, she declared that they were not of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> origin but were probably made by Atsinas. Relieved that they
                  were not the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>', the explorers may have been equally
                  disappointed that the camps were not <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>. If the moccasins were visual signs of Indian life along the
                  Missouri, the powerful stench of rotting buffalo carcasses was an equally potent
                  reminder of the native presence. Although recent archaeological studies by W.
                  Raymond Wood have indicated that the route of travel for May 29 did not pass a
                  buffalo jump, the mass of buffalo remains did prompt Lewis to write a detailed
                  description of a <hi rend="italic">pishkun</hi> or jump and the dangerous
                  techniques used by Indians to lure animals over the edge.<ref target="n0611" n="11"/>

               <p> By the time Lewis and his advance party reached the Great Falls of the Missouri
                  on June 13, 1805, the expedition had been traveling for over two months, and once
                  past the Yellowstone there had been no encounters with Indians. The goal of
                  avoiding <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> or other potentially hostile natives was achieved
                  more by good fortune than skill. But as the explorers labored over the grueling
                  Great Falls portage, the captains thought increasingly about finding <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> horses. Their growing concern can be measured by an important
                  decision made during the portage. Earlier in the journey, Lewis and Clark had
                  given some thought to sending one canoe and a few men back to St. Louis from the
                  falls carrying news of the party. That plan was now quietly abandoned, partly
                  because it might have discouraged the whole group and, perhaps more important,
                  because "not haveing seen the Snake Indians or knowing in fact whither to
                  calculate on their friendship or hostillity, we have conceived our party
                  sufficiently small." Although it is not clear from the expedition's record whether
                  Sacagawea led the explorers to expect to find the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> near the falls, there certainly were indications that those
                  Indians had been in the area recently.<ref target="n0612" n="12"/> On July 16, one
                  day after the explorers finished the portage, Lewis was taking one of his usual
                  walks along the Missouri when he came upon a large and recent <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> camp. Spotting what would later be familiar to him as the
                  cone-shaped <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> brush wickiup and also noting much horse sign, Lewis concluded
                  that he had "much hope of meeting with these people shortly."<ref target="n0613" n="13"/>
               </p>
               <p> Convinced that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were just days away and could provide both horses and
                  "information relative to the geography of the country," Lewis and Clark made an
                  important decision. On July 18, Clark took an advance party consisting of York,
                  Joseph Field, and John Potts on ahead. Moving quickly, Clark hoped to find the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> before they were frightened by hunters' guns from
                  the larger group.<ref target="n0614" n="14"/> In the days that followed, both
                  Clark's forward team and Lewis's main contingent strained for any hint that their
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> search was over. Saturday, July 20, brought more
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> signs but no Indians. Early in the morning Lewis saw
                  smoke up Potts' Creek. Unsure of the smoke's significance, the explorer thought it
                  was either accidental or a deliberate Indian signal. According to his journal
                  entry for the day, he learned later that some <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> had seen either his or Clark's men, feared they were
                  Blackfeet warriors, and fled from the river. Later the same day Clark's force,
                  painfully working its way up a path filled with sharp rocks and prickly pear along
                  Pryor's Valley Creek, saw a second smoke signal. Eager to let Indians know they
                  were friends, not enemy raiders, Clark and his men took to scattering pieces of
                  clothing, paper, and linen tape along their route.<ref target="n0615" n="15"/>
                  Despite these efforts, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> seemed as tantalizingly out of reach as their smoke
                  signals.</p>
               <p> Frustrated by their failure to contact the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and increasingly tired by the rigors of a difficult river
                  passage, the expedition pressed on toward the Three Forks. Although the explorers
                  never expected Sacagawea to guide them in the usual sense of the word, they did
                  hope she would recognize some of the country once the expedition entered <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> hunting grounds. But it was not until July 22 that the Indian
                  woman began to see country remembered from those days before her kidnaping by
                  Hidatsas. As the main body of the expedition neared Pryor's Valley Creek,
                  Sacagawea pointed out familiar landmarks and assured Lewis that this was "the
                  river on which her relations live[d], and that the three forks [were] at no great
                  distance." Tacitly admitting just how worried the whole Corps of Discovery was at
                  not yet finding the Indians, Lewis wrote that Sacagawea's news "cheered the
                  sperits of the party who now begin to console themselves with the anticipation of
                  shortly seeing the head of the missouri yet unknown to the civilized world." Later
                  that evening, with both the advance party and the main body reunited, Lewis and
                  Clark planned strategy for what they felt was an imminent meeting with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Believing that the Indians would be found at Three Forks,
                  the captains decided to send Clark again with a small group to reconnoiter the
                  route and make initial contact.<ref target="n0616" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p> Excited by the prospect that their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> quest might soon be ended and that Indian horses would carry
                  them over an easy portage to Pacific waters, the two groups set out the next
                  morning. Clark took with him Robert Frazer, Joseph and Reuben Field, and Toussaint
                  Charbonneau. To reassure Indians that they were friends, Lewis ordered that small
                  American flags fly from every canoe. While Clark followed Indian paths toward
                  Three Forks, Lewis and the boats pressed upriver. Each group found the going
                  difficult and exhausting. Hiking over broken terrain filled with sharp rocks and
                  prickly pear, Clark's men suffered twisted ankles and lacerated feet. The boat
                  crews had it no less easy. The Missouri was now a narrow channel choked with
                  willow islands, rocky shallows, and unexpected rapids. Towing their craft from the
                  shore exposed the men's moccasined feet to the needle spines of the prickly pear.
                  Working boats in the water became a back-breaking, bone-chilling enterprise.
                  Ordway understated the obvious when he wrote, "The party in general are much
                  fatigued." But swollen feet and aching bones would have been gladly accepted had
                  the effort produced a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> encounter. When Clark reached Three Forks on July 25, he found
                  a fire-blackened prairie and horse tracks but no Indians. Two days later Lewis and
                  the main body came to Three Forks, found Clark's note detailing what he had
                  discovered thus far, and saw for themselves that the valley held only silence.<ref target="n0617" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> The Three Forks of the Missouri was what Lewis described it to be, "an essential
                  point in the geography of this western part of the Continent." But one of the
                  essentials was missing. Without Indian horses the expedition would be stranded on
                  the wrong side of the Great Divide. Facing a second winter east of the mountains,
                  on short rations and unsure of the route ahead, the expedition was at a desperate
                  point. Lewis put it bluntly: "We begin to feel considerable anxiety with rispect
                  to the Snake Indians. If we do not find them or some other nation who have horses
                  I fear the successful issue of our voyage will be very doubtful or at all events
                  much more difficult in it's accomplishment."<ref target="n0618" n="18"/> The
                  explorers did not understand that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> bands did not come across the mountains and into the Three
                  Forks region until September. At the very moment when the worried captains were
                  holding talks plotting what to do next, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> were still busy fishing along the Lemhi and Salmon
                  rivers.</p>
               <p> The expedition camped at Three Forks, where Sacagawea had been kidnaped from a
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> band some five years earlier. It was a time to treat
                  blistered and infected feet, repair clothing and moccasins, and dry dampened
                  papers and trade goods. But the most important task at Three Forks was formulation
                  of a plan to locate the elusive <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Perhaps guided by information supplied by Sacagawea, the
                  explorers now believed the Indians were either further up the Jefferson River or
                  across the mountains still fishing.<ref target="n0619" n="19"/> Wherever they
                  were, they had to be found. Using a tactic employed before, Lewis and Clark
                  decided to send a scouting party ahead while the main group continued up the
                  Jefferson. Since Clark was still recovering from an infection caused by prickly
                  pear punctures, Lewis led the scouts.<ref target="n0620" n="20"/>
               </p>
               <p> The first week of August 1805 must have seemed an eternity to the frustrated and
                  exhausted men of the expedition. Everything that could go awry did. Laboring up
                  the Jefferson in a channel that was barely navigable, Clark's boat crews slipped
                  in the mud, tripped over hidden rocks, and spent hours waist-deep in cold water.
                  Men who usually did not complain in the face of hardship were now "so much
                  fortiegued that they wished much that navigation was at an end that they might go
                  by land."<ref target="n0621" n="21"/> Canoes overturned, tow ropes broke, and the
                  air was blue with tough talk. As a last straw, a beaver had gnawed through the
                  green willow branch holding a message from Lewis, causing the boats to make a
                  needless and painful detour up the Big Hole (Wisdom) River. And George Shannon got
                  lost on a hunting trek up the Big Hole. The efforts of Lewis's scouting party to
                  locate the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were no more successful than previous ones. There
                  were signs of Indian activity, but as before they yielded neither people nor
                  horses. When the two captains again joined forces on August 6 and proceeded up the
                  Jefferson, they had to face some harsh realities. Several men, including Clark and
                  Whitehouse, were injured and in pain, while many others were near exhaustion.
                  Valuable trade goods, medicine, and powder were wet and damaged. Food supplies
                  were uncertain. And above all, there was the inescapable fact that unless the
                  expedition found horses very soon it would have to pack only a fraction of its
                  supplies across the divide and look for a place to winter in mountains known for
                  their scarcity of game. The men's spirits and prospects would not be as low again
                  until the bitter days in the snows of the Lolo Trail.</p>
               <p> These bleak prospects began to change on August 8. With the explorers just below
                  the mouth of the Ruby (Philanthropy) River, Sacagawea recognized "the point of a
                  high plain to our right which she informed us was not very distant from the summer
                  retreat of her nation on a river beyond the mountains which runs to the west."
                  Known to Indians as the Beaver's Head because it reminded them of a swimming
                  beaver, the rock brought both hope and a sense of urgency to the expedition. "As
                  it is now all important with us to meet those people as soon as possible," the
                  captains decided to once again send Lewis on ahead with George Drouillard, Hugh
                  McNeal, and John Shields. Lewis vowed to find horses if it took a month of hard
                     travel.<ref target="n0622" n="22"/> On the next morning, August 9, Lewis and
                  his men swung on their packs and began to follow the Jefferson River toward the
                  mountains. The whole future of the expedition depended on Lewis's success in
                  finding the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and trading for horses in something less than a month.</p>
               <p> All day on August 9, Lewis and his men tracked along the Jefferson. Seeing the
                  river "very crooked much divided by islands, shallow, rocky in many places and
                  very rapid," Lewis worried that Clark's boats might not be able to make the
                  passage. On the following day the explorers "fel in with a plain Indian road"
                  which took them past Rattlesnake Cliffs to a fork in the Beaverhead River. Because
                  the path also forked and Lewis did not want to waste time on the wrong trail, he
                  dispatched Drouillard up one way while Shields took the other. Sensing that this
                  fork also marked the end of navigable waters, Lewis left a note for Clark telling
                  him to go no further until the advance party returned. Lewis and his men now set
                  out along Horse Prairie Creek, a small stream that flowed from the West. Horse
                  Prairie Creek led the explorers into Shoshoni Cove, described by Lewis as one of
                  the "handsomest" coves he had ever seen. Camping that night in the cove, Lewis and
                  his men ate venison roasted over a willow brush fire and wondered what lay beyond
                  the dividing ridge.<ref target="n0623" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p> Sunday, August 11, proved to be one of the most important days for the
                  expedition. It was a day equally important for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> of Cameahwait's band camped over the divide along the Lemhi
                  River. Soon after Lewis and his men set out from their camp in Shoshoni Cove the
                  Indian trail vanished in dense sagebrush. Anxious not to miss what proved to be
                  Lemhi Pass over the Beaverhead Mountains, Lewis ordered Drouillard to walk on the
                  captain's right flank while Shields would cover the left. McNeal was to remain
                  with Lewis as the whole formation moved slowly through the cove and toward the
                  pass. Five miles of this maneuver got Lewis closer to Lemhi Pass, but it still
                  seemed no nearer to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Then suddenly, some two miles off, Lewis spotted an Indian
                  horse and rider cantering toward him. With the aid of his small telescope, Lewis
                  identified the Indian as a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>. The armed warrior was riding an "eligant" horse and had not
                  yet seen the Americans. Overjoyed at the prospect of finally meeting the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, Lewis walked slowly toward the Indian. The explorer was
                  certain that once the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> saw his white skin any fears would disappear. With about a
                  mile now separating the two the Indian stopped and Lewis is likewise halted.
                  Determined to make some friendly gesture, Lewis took his blanket and waved it
                  three times in the air. Perhaps Drouillard had told him that this was the accepted
                  sign for peaceful conversation between strangers. But the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> apparently discounted Lewis's signal and watched with mounting
                  suspicion as Drouillard and Shields drew closer. Unable to catch the attention of
                  either man, Lewis feared that their continued march would frighten the Indian and
                  dash any hopes of a friendly meeting. Lewis took a few strands of beads, a mirror,
                  and some other trade items and began to walk alone toward the still-mounted
                  Indian. When the men were no more than two hundred paces apart, the Indian slowly
                  turned his horse and began to ride away. In desperation Lewis shouted out the word
                  "tab-ba-bone," which he believed was <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> for whiteman. The explorer knew that Drouillard and Shields
                  had to be stopped or all would be lost. Risking a shout and some vigorous waving,
                  Lewis commanded both men to halt. Drouillard obeyed but Shields evidently did not
                  see the signal. The Indian moved off a bit more and then stopped a second time.
                  With steady determination Lewis resumed walking toward the man, again saying
                  "tab-ba-bone," holding up the trade goods, and even stripping up his shirt sleeves
                  to show white skin. But none of this worked and when the two were no more than one
                  hundred paces apart, the Indian whipped up his horse and vanished into the willow
                  brush.</p>
               <p> "With him," wrote Lewis, "vanished all my hopes of obtaining horses for the
                  present." Depressed and angry, Lewis rounded up his men and "could not forbare
                  abraiding them a little for their want of attention and imprudence on this
                  occasion." Although Lewis blamed Drouillard and Shields for the failure at
                  Shoshoni Cove, other factors were also at work. The Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> had just suffered a punishing raid at the hands of Atsina
                  warriors and were bound to view any stranger with considerable suspicion. More
                  important, there was the matter of the word "tab-ba-bone." Lewis had probably
                  asked either Charbonneau or Sacagawea for a word meaning "whiteman." Since that
                  word did not exist in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> vocabulary, the explorer was given the term for stranger or
                  foreigner. The Indian kinship world was divided between relatives who were friends
                  and strangers who were potential enemies. Shouting "tab-ba-bone" to an already
                  fearful <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> was hardly the way to begin a successful talk.</p>
               <p> Knowing that the day's opportunity was lost, Lewis decided to pause in the cove
                  for breakfast. While the rest of the men cooked, Lewis prepared a small parcel of
                  beads, moccasin awls, paint, and a mirror. Tying the goods to a pole stuck in the
                  ground near the campfire, Lewis hoped the gifts would attract <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> attention and convince them that the strangers were interested
                  in trading, not raiding. A sudden rain shower made following the Shoshoni's tracks
                  impossible. Wet grass hampered walking and a maze of horse prints made deciding
                  which track to follow difficult and frustrating. Camping that night at the head of
                  Shoshoni Cove, Lewis may well have wondered whether the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> would forever remain just beyond his grasp.<ref target="n0624" n="24"/>
               </p>
               <p> For the Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> of Cameahwait's band, August 11, 1805, had seemed like any
                  other day in late summer. Groups of women and children were out on the prairies
                  digging roots. Others were busy at fish weirs or gigging for salmon with sharp,
                  barbed sticks. Most men were occupied with hunting or tending to the needs of
                  horses and weapons. One man who had been out riding near a creek on the other side
                  of the mountains saw strangers whose faces he had described as "pale as ashes."
                  But the report seemed preposterous and after some talk it was dismissed as an idle
                  boast. What counted that day was that the band would soon join <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> friends in journeying toward the Three Forks for the buffalo
                  season. They would no longer be <hi rend="italic">ágaideka'a</hi>, or salmon
                  eaters, but <hi rend="italic">kutsendeka'a</hi>, those who ate the buffalo. There
                  would be danger from enemies like the Atsinas and Blackfeet, but there would also
                  be fresh meat to end days of near starvation. That anything might alter the
                  familiar seasonal rhythm was almost unthinkable.<ref target="n0625" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis expected the next day to bring the long-hoped-for <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> encounter. Early that morning Lewis sent George Drouillard out
                  to track. Continuing on the trail as it led toward Lemhi Pass, Lewis saw places
                  where Indian women had been digging roots. Brush lodges were also signs that the
                  Shoshinis were near. Although Lewis's party did not find the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> on August 12, it was a memorable day. Near the crest of the
                  pass the explorers found "the most distant fountain of the waters of the Mighty
                  Missouri." Later recalling McNeal standing astride the headwaters creek, Lewis
                  exalted that "thus far I had accomplished one of those great objects on which my
                  mind has been unalterably fixed for many years." After drinking from the stream
                  and resting for a moment, Lewis and his men crossed the Continental
                  Divide—the first Americans to make the passage—and stood looking at
                  the Bitterroot Mountains. Not even those "immence ranges of high mountains still
                  to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow" could dampen
                  Lewis's enthusiasm as he drank at the Lemhi River and for the first time tasted
                  western waters.<ref target="n0626" n="26"/> For all the glory and excitement of
                  the day, Lewis must have known that the expedition's essential problem remained
                  unsolved. Seeing one <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>, observing many Indian signs, and crossing the divide did not
                  bring horses into the explorers' corral.</p>
               <p> Breaking camp on August 13 somewhere down a mountain slope toward the Lemhi
                  River, Lewis and his men followed the Indian trail as it led into the Lemhi
                  Valley. After covering about four miles, the explorers' attention was drawn to a
                  ridge directly in front of them. Up on the ridge, watching them intently, were two
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> women, a man, and several dogs. Frightened by the
                  sudden appearance of strangers, two of the Indians sat on the ground as if
                  preparing for the arrival of enemy raiders. When the Americans were no more than
                  half a mile from the Indians, Lewis ordered his men to halt. Leaving his rifle and
                  pack, Lewis picked up a large American flag, unfurled it, and walked slowly toward
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Despite Lewis's cautious approach, the Indian
                  fled. Perhaps once again the word "tab-ba-bone" was more damaging than he
                  understood. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were gone but their dogs were more inquisitive, sniffing and
                  barking at the strangers. Seizing on any tactic that might convince the Indians of
                  his peaceful intentions, Lewis tried to tie trade goods to the dogs' necks. But
                  the animals were too skittish and the plan failed.</p>
               <p> Intent on finding the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, Lewis and his men began to backtrack along a dusty trail
                  that "appeared to have been much traveled lately both by men and horses." After
                  about a mile of moving through the steep ravines of the Lemhi Valley, the
                  explorers suddenly stumbled on three <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> women. One immediately fled in terror, but an elderly woman
                  and a young girl calmly sat on the ground with their heads down, waiting for what
                  they must have thought was certain death at the hand of hostile strangers. Lewis
                  walked up to the two frightened Indians, took the older woman by the hand, and
                  repeated the now-familiar "tab-ba-bone." At the same time, he pushed up one shirt
                  sleeve to reveal white skin. Seeing that the women were somewhat more calm, he
                  handed out some gifts. Worried that the one woman who ran away might alarm nearby
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> warriors, Lewis made signs for the older woman to
                  call back her companion. The explorer knew from Sacagawea that vermilion
                  symbolized peace for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, and he promptly daubed the women's faces with paint as one
                  more way to communicate his intentions. Once again using signs, he asked them to
                  guide the Americans to the main Indian encampment.</p>
               <p> Led by the Indian women along a trail beside the Lemhi River, Lewis and his men
                  were suddenly confronted by a band of some sixty mounted warriors riding at full
                  speed. Warned by one of the Indians who had seen Lewis earlier in the day,
                  Cameahwait had marshaled his warriors and was now prepared to do battle. Acting
                  quickly Lewis dropped his gun, held up a flag, and walked toward the advancing
                  Indians. Out ahead of the main warrior party rode the band chief Camehwait and two
                  lesser chiefs. Seeing Lewis and the women, the chief reined up his horse, had a
                  hurried talk with the women who excitedly showed them their gifts, and then rode
                  on toward Lewis. In that moment when Cameahwait and his fellow chiefs were coming
                  toward him, Lewis must have wondered just what sort of reception to expect. Any
                  fears he had quickly evaporated as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> chiefs warmly embraced him and repeated the word "ah-hi-e," "I
                  am much pleased." What followed was a great festival of embracing and shouting as
                  the Americans were "all carresed and besmeared with their grease and paint" until
                  Lewis admitted he was "heartily tired of the national hug." Following proper
                  plains diplomatic protocol, Lewis sat on the ground with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and smoked a pipe. To show their good faith and genuine
                  welcome, the Indians removed their moccasins during the ritual smoke. Once the
                  smoking was finished, Lewis moved to cement good relations with his new-found
                  friends. While he distributed trade goods—including a generous amount of
                  blue beads and vermilion—Lewis used signs to explain briefly that he and his
                  friends were in <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> country for peace and trade. Hot and thirsty from what had
                  already seemed a very long day, Lewis was anxious to get on toward the Lemhi River
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> camp. But Cameahwait was in no particular hurry and
                  preferred to savor the moment by giving two long speeches to his warriors. It was
                  not until late in the afternoon that the explorers and their native escort came to
                  the Indian camp along the Lemhi.</p>
               <p> If Lewis thought that he and his men could rest for the remainder of the day, he
                  had not taken the measure of just how much the Americans were a curiosity and a
                  social happening. Ushered into a skin tepee, the only one still owned by the band
                  after the recent Atsina raid, the explorers were ceremoniously seated on green
                  boughs and antelope skins. Once again there was ritual smoking, as explorers and
                  Indians sat facing each other across what Lewis characterized as a "little magic
                  circle." The ceremony complete, Lewis spoke through Drouillard's signs to explain
                  who they were, what their mission was, and what they hoped to obtain from the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. As Lewis talked, the crowd around the tepee
                  swelled with women and children intent on seeing the outlandish pale beings. Now
                  late in the evening, Lewis recalled that he had eaten nothing since the previous
                  night. His request for food brought some serviceberry and chokecherry cakes, plain
                  food but for Lewis and his men a welcome meal. The berry cakes satisfied Lewis's
                  stomach, but a small bit of salmon did more to gratify his mind. That salmon
                  convinced him that "we were on the waters of the Pacific Ocean."</p>
               <p> But any hope Lewis had of an easy passage to the Columbia was shattered when
                  Cameahwait told him about the treacherous course of the Salmon River. For now,
                  Lewis consoled himself with the belief that "this account had been exagerated with
                  a view to detain us among them." Exhausted by one of the most momentous days in
                  the life of the expedition, Lewis left Drouillard, Shields, and McNeal to dance
                  with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> while he sought "a tolerable sound night's
                     repose."<ref target="n0627" n="27"/>
               </p>
               <p> The day had been every bit as momentous for Cameahwait's people. Their familiar
                  patterns of hunting, fishing, gathering, and preparing for the annual buffalo hunt
                  had been interrupted by the arrival of strangers whose appearance was disturbing
                  and whose intentions were unknown. Although northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> had long been exposed to European goods from Spanish sources,
                  there is little evidence to suggest that anyone in the Lemhi bands had ever seen a
                  white man. It is difficult to know just what the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> thought of Lewis and the others. Certainly they were
                  fascinated and delighted with the gifts, including mirrors that were described in
                  one oral tradition as "things like solid water, which were sometimes brilliant as
                  the sun, and which sometimes showed us our faces." Dazzled by those mirrors and
                  the sudden arrival of pale strangers, many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> imagined Lewis and his men were "the children of the Great
                  Spirit."</p>
               <p> But not every <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> in camp that night was filled with wonder and delight. There
                  was a great deal of suspicion. A number of warriors believed that Lewis's party
                  were really agents for the Blackfeet or some other hostile people. That fear was
                  increased by the weapons carried by the explorers as well as by Lewis's request
                  that the band go to Shoshoni Cove to aid Clark's party. Despite all the dancing
                  and good cheer in camp that night, the Indians' fears were growing. Those fears
                  would have to be confronted and resolved if the expedition was to gain the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>' cooperation.<ref target="n0628" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> Knowing he had to give Clark's weary boat crews time to navigate the Beaverhead
                  River as far as the forks, Lewis decided to spend a day at the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> camp. That extra day would serve Clark's needs as well as give
                  Lewis an opportunity to gain additional geographical information from Cameahwait.
                  The explorer spent most of the morning working on his journal and talking through
                  Drouillard's signs with the chief. At midday Lewis decided to organize a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> move toward the rendezvous with Clark. Lewis wanted Cameahwait
                  to provide porters and at least thirty horses to carry the expedition's baggage
                  over Lemhi Pass and on to the Indian village. The chief seemingly agreed and,
                  after a long speech to his warriors, told Lewis that everyone would be ready to
                  move the next morning. That news, and a report from Drouillard that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> had some four hundred fine horses and mules, gave Lewis
                  reason to believe that his effort to gain Indian support was succeeding.<ref target="n0629" n="29"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis had hoped that on the following morning, August 15, Cameahwait's band and
                  their horses would be ready to make the journey back across the divide. But
                  despite his efforts at gentle persuasion, it became increasingly clear throughout
                  the morning that the Indians were reluctant to leave camp. Cameahwait repeatedly
                  encouraged his people to leave their river village and follow Lewis, but the
                  chief's efforts failed and an exasperated Lewis finally demanded to know what was
                  wrong. As Cameahwait explained it, "Some foolish persons among them had suggested
                  the idea that we were in league with the Pahkees [Siksika Blackfeet] and had come
                  on in order to decoy them into an ambuscade where their enimies were waiting to
                  receive them." While Cameahwait claimed that he did not share his warriors'
                  apprehensions, the chief's behavior both that day and the next suggests that he
                  was quite worried. For these <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> there was ground for fear even if it infuriated Lewis. The
                  band had suffered severe economic and personal losses at the hands of everyone
                  from the Knife River Hidatsas to the Blackfeet. Outgunned and perhaps outmanned by
                  an unknown force, the Indians had every reason to be wary.</p>
               <p> At the same time, Lewis realized the necessity of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> cooperation in ferrying men and equipment over the pass and
                  their overall support in providing horses if no water route to the Columbia could
                  be found. Seeking both to reassure and prod the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, Lewis told them he was disappointed in their lack of
                  confidence in his good character. Aware of how much the Indians wanted
                  manufactured goods, he threatened to block any future trade in guns and
                  ammunition. As a final shot, the explorer raised doubts about the valor of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> men, saying that those who refused to help him were cowards.
                  Lewis believed he had "touched the right string" when he questioned native
                  courage. Whatever caused the turnabout, several warriors now joined Cameahwait and
                  declared their readiness to make the trip. Theirs was not a popular decision, and
                  as the joint <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>-American party left camp "several of the old women were crying
                  and imploring the great spirit to protect their warriors as if they were going to
                  inevitable destruction."<ref target="n0630" n="30"/> As explorers and Indians
                  camped that night at the upper end of Shoshoni Cove, Lewis might well have
                  pondered his fate and that of the expedition if Clark's party did not appear the
                  next day.</p>
               <p> What should have been a pleasant reunion between Lewis and Clark on August 16
                  proved instead to be a day filled with tension, fear, and deception. Early in the
                  morning, Lewis sent out Drouillard and Shields to do some hunting. Without meaning
                  to, the explorer promptly increased the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>' suspicions when he asked the Indians to be quiet lest they
                  frighten the game. Thinking that they were now the hunted quarry, two groups of
                  Indians rode off down the cove to shadow Drouillard and Shields. It was not a good
                  way to begin the day, and things soon became even more tense. As Lewis and
                  Cameahwait made their way down through the cove, one of the Indian scouts came
                  riding up the plain at full whip. Lewis's first thought was that by "some
                  unfortunate accident" a hostile war party was in the neighborhood and had been
                  confused with the main expedition group. All fears were quickly allayed when the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> announced his news, explaining that Drouillard had
                  killed a deer and all were invited to feast on it. As hungry Indians ate the
                  uncooked meat, Lewis took note that the fear of possible ambush had reduced the
                  caravan to no more than twenty-eight men and three women. Since the women were
                  expected to play the porter role, his count was not reassuring.</p>
               <p> With the bloody meal over, Lewis carefully explained to Cameahwait just where the
                  main body of the expedition would be encountered. The chief replied by placing
                  skin tippets or mantles around the necks of the Americans. Although impressed with
                  the tippets, Lewis believed that they were an attempt to disguise the explorers as
                  one more move to prepare for a possible ambush. Not wanting to arouse any
                  suspicions, he accepted the tippet and gave Cameahwait his army cocked hat.
                  Wearing a buckskin shirt and sporting a dark summer tan, Lewis looked "a complete
                  Indian." By now his central concern was that Clark would not be at the appointed
                  place and that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> would turn either violent or uncooperative. When the
                  explorers and their Indian escort came to within two miles of the forks of the
                  Beaverhead, Lewis could see that Clark's boats were not there. Genuinely worried,
                  he watched as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> cautiously slowed their pace. Writing later in his journal,
                  the explorer admitted that he simply did not know what to do. With a determination
                  bred of desperation, Lewis handed Cameahwait his gun, telling him that "if his
                  enemies were in those bushes before him that he could defend himself with that
                  gun." Lewis claimed that for his part he did not fear death and challenged
                  Cameahwait to shoot him if the Americans were guilty of deception. Following
                  Lewis's bold move, the other explorers gave their guns to the warriors. Lewis's
                  quick thinking temporarily quieted the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>' fears. It also gave the captain time to seize on a second
                  strategem to retain the Indians' confidence. Recalling the notes he had tied to a
                  stake as a means of communication with Clark, Lewis now claimed that the letters
                  were actually written by Clark. Lewis boldly told Cameahwait that the expedition
                  was having difficulty navigating the Jefferson and "was coming up slowly." Lewis
                  later admitted that lying to the chief, although justified by the occasion, "set a
                  little awkward."</p>
               <p> Neither Lewis nor the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> slept well that night. Most of the Indians camped away from
                  the fire light, hiding in the brush to avoid being caught in an enemy raid. Many
                  of them continued to doubt the wisdom of trusting the strangers. Bitterness
                  mounted against Cameahwait as several warriors charged the chief with exposing
                  them to unnecessary danger. Perhaps seeing through some of Lewis's tales, some
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> insisted that the Americans were telling different
                  and contradictory stories. Still smarting from the recent Atsina raid, these wary
                  warriors found only a fitful sleep. Lewis's night was no less troubled. Filled
                  with gloomy thoughts, he turned over in his mind all the possible causes for
                  Clark's delay. His greatest fear was that Clark had found the river so difficult
                  that the main body had halted well below the forks. If Clark's group did not
                  appear the next day, the Indians would abandon Lewis and his men. "I knew," wrote
                  Lewis later, "that if these people left me that they would immediately disperse
                  and secrete themselves in the mountains where it would be impossible to find them
                  or at least in vain to pursue them and that they would spread the allarm to all
                  other bands within our reach &amp; of course we should be disappointed in
                  obtaining horses, which would vastly retard and increase the labour of our voyage
                  and I feared might so discourage the men as to defeat the expedition altogether."
                  Feigning unconcern but in reality as worried as "the most affrighted Indian,"
                  Lewis tried to maintain the Indians' confidence with stories, told around a willow
                  brush fire, of York, Sacagawea, and the great store of goods the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> would get in trade for their horses.<ref target="n0631" n="31"/> Among the many remarkable days and nights of the expedition, this day
                  and its tension-filled night must have long remained in Lewis's memory. For the
                  Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, it was their last night before entering the world
                  of white men.</p>
               <p> Lewis's guess that Clark and the boat crews were having great difficulty
                  navigating the Beaverhead River proved correct. Its swift current and shallow
                  channel had tested the expedition's strength almost to the limit of endurance.
                  Early on the morning of August 17, 1805, the boat crews set out for another day's
                  battle with the Beaverhead. At the same time, Lewis nervously sent out Drouillard
                  and an Indian companion with a note urging Clark to come on with all possible
                  speed. By midmorning Clark was at the forks of the Beaverhead. Anxious not to miss
                  any trace of Lewis or the Indians, Clark, Charbonneau, and Sacagawea walked out
                  ahead. About a mile from the forks, Clark saw several mounted Indians riding
                  toward him. Sacagawea and Charbonneau, who had evidently gotten ahead of Clark,
                  "began to dance and show every sign of joy" as they recognized the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Sacagawea sucked her fingers as a sign that these men
                  belonged to her own people. As the explorer and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> party neared each other, Clark recognized George Drouillard.
                  The meeting took place with "great signs of joy." Some time later, as Clark moved
                  up toward what would soon become Camp Fortunate, one of the Indians reported to
                  Lewis that whites had been seen and were coming upriver. The stage was now set for
                  a grand reunion and serious <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> negotiations.</p>
               <p> The arrival at Camp Fortunate had all the elements of pageantry and fictional
                  romance. In his understated way, Lewis was "much gratifyed" by Clark's appearance.
                  But there was nothing understated about the Indians' reception. Clark's hair was
                  festooned with shells and he was subjected to the usual round of "national hugs."
                  While Cameahwait was busy welcoming Clark as something akin to a visiting god,
                  other <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> watched in astonishment at the parade of men,
                  boats, and equipment. Not only fascinated with clothing, guns, and canoes, the
                  Indians gaped at York's blackness and "the segassity of Capt. Lewis's dog." In the
                  midst of all this excitement there was another reunion yet more dramatic and
                  improbable. As the baggage was being taken from the canoes, one of the three <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> women in Lewis's group recognized Sacagawea. The two women had
                  been captured in the same Hidatsa raid. No sooner had these two sat down than
                  Sacagawea began to stare at Cameahwait. Suddenly recognizing him as her brother,
                  "she jumped up, ran &amp; embraced him, &amp; threw her blanket over him and cried
                  profusely." In a week that had seen tension, fear, deception, and determination,
                  Sacagawea's homecoming was not out of place. Once again the stars had danced for
                  Lewis and Clark.</p>
               <p> Toward late afternoon, with baggage and people sorted out, the captains prepared
                  for some serious talk with Cameahwait and the other <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> chiefs. Sitting under an enclosure of willow brush and sail
                  cloth, Lewis and Clark began their usual diplomatic litany. Not trusting to
                  Drouillard's signs, the captains employed a cumbersome translation chain
                  consisting of Sacagawea, Charbonneau, and François Labiche. By this means,
                  Cameahwait was told "the objects which had brought us into this distant part of
                  the country." But even more important than explaining the expedition's goals or
                  fitting the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> into the American trade system was the need for Indian
                  horses. Hoping to interest the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> in horse trading, the captains declared that their principal
                  purpose for making so hazardous a journey was to discover a practical trade route
                  for American merchandise. Because the trade could not begin until the explorers
                  had fulfilled their mission, Lewis and Clark pointedly reminded Cameahwait it
                  would be "mutually advantageous to them as well as to ourselves that they should
                  render us such aids as they had it in their power to furnish to hasten our voyage
                  and of course our return home."</p>
               <p> Cameahwait certainly got the message. Faced with well-armed enemies and an
                  uncertain supply of manufactured goods from Spanish sources, he could hardly
                  reject the opportunity to have a place in the new American trade system. Guns and
                  ammunition, especially, were on the chief's mind. Ordway counted only two or three
                  guns and no ammunition among the warriors at Camp Fortunate. Cameahwait's personal
                  war name, Too-et-te-con'l or Black Gun, was just one more indication of the
                  special emphasis northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> placed on firearms. Without thinking much about the
                  consequences of arming the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>—consequences that would be felt by Hidatsa, Blackfeet,
                  and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> warriors—Lewis and Clark made any promise in
                  order to obtain the necessary horses. Cameahwait's apparent agreement to provide
                  whatever was required was followed by the usual program of handing out medals to
                  chiefs, distributing gifts to onlookers, and showing off the always impressive
                  airgun.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark finished the eventful day plotting strategy for crossing the
                  Continental Divide and finding western waters. Their plan called for Clark,
                  Charbonneau, Sacagawea, and eleven men to cross the divide and follow the Lemhi
                  River. Charbonneau and Sacagawea were to remain at the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> village, organizing the Indians' efforts to carry expedition
                  baggage over the pass. Clark and his men were to reconnoiter possible water routes
                  to the Columbia. While these efforts were taking place west of the divide, Lewis
                  proposed to remain at Camp Fortunate to supervise the transportation over Lemhi
                  Pass. Both expedition parties would eventually join forces at the Lemhi River

               <p> The six days Lewis spent at Camp Fortunate were his first extended opportunity to
                  study and record major features of northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> culture. Lewis's descriptions of the objects that made up the
                  daily life of the Indians revealed just how much he had learned during the Fort
                  Mandan apprenticeship. With Sacagawea gone, Lewis lacked both a knowledgeable
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> informant and a reliable translator. Nor could he
                  depend on well-informed white traders like those at Fort Mandan. Rather, he had to
                  rely on careful observation; an occasional detail would be added later by
                  Sacagawea or Cameahwait. Despite such problems, Lewis discovered and recorded a
                  vast store of information about <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> life.<ref target="n0633" n="33"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although Lewis had begun to note important aspects of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> life as early as August 13, it was not until August 19 that
                  the explorer undertook a systematic description of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> material culture. Using the now-familiar categories first
                  employed to analyze Upper Missouri villager ways, Lewis wrote about <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"

                  weapons. Hunting techniques, fishing methods, cooking pots, spoons, and tobacco
                  pipes all were noted in the explorer's record. So long as there were objects for
                  him to look at, Lewis was able to provide masterful descriptions. But when dealing
                  with social values and personal relations, he tended to rely on traditional
                  European stereotypes of Indians.</p>
               <p> Because Lewis could handle clothing and observe it with his keen naturalist's
                  eye, he filled his journal with words about moccasins, leggings, shirts, robes,
                  and ornaments. Every piece of clothing, and often its method of construction, was
                  described with his typical attention to detail. But no article in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> wardrobe so captivated the explorer as the ermine tippet given
                  to him by Cameahwait. Lewis described it as "the most eligant peice of Indian
                  dress I ever saw."<ref target="n0634" n="34"/>
               </p>
               <p> Always interested in weapons, Lewis took special note of the various kinds of
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> bows and arrows. Recognizing that sacred forces were
                  often attached to certain weapons, Lewis took time to record the construction of
                  and special ceremonies surrounding <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> hide shields. As he explained it, the preparation of a
                  buffalo-hide shield required several days of feasting and ritual during which band
                  elders and shamans carefully worked the skin. If both the sacred and secular
                  processes were properly done, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> believed that the shield would repel arrows and bullets.<ref target="n0635" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p> Skilled at describing the shapes and uses of native objects, Lewis found it more
                  difficult to discuss the Indian band's social behavior without falling back on the
                  clichés used by Europeans for centuries. He depicted <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> men as lazy husbands who mistreated their wives while
                  lavishing attention on a favorite horse. He saw Indian women as squaw drudges who
                  did all the heavy work and hardly paused during a supposedly painless childbirth.
                  Indian parents spoiled their sons and sold their daughters to the highest bidder.
                  The explorer insisted that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> men and women engaged in easy sex, and although he noted that
                  virtue among women was more valued than in the Missouri River villages, he
                  asserted that it was not above price. The expedition's commitment to ethnographic
                  externals suited Lewis's skills and some of his cultural biases. He could bring to
                  life a weapon or a skin shirt, but the people who created those objects always
                  seemed just beyond his reach.</p>
               <p> No place was that more plain than in Lewis's attempt to describe the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> character. By the time Lewis and Clark reached the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, the explorers had a well-developed set of ideas about plains
                  natives. The Missouri River villagers were potential customers and allies to be
                  courted and protected. They were, in Clark's memorable phrase, "durtey, kind,
                  pore, and extravigent." But buffalo and horse plains people like the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref> held a very different place in the explorers'
                  mind. Those tribes were viewed as hostile, unreliable, and innately violent. When
                  Lewis attempted to evaluate the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> temperament, he was caught between those negative judgments
                  and the fact that he and others in the expedition found much to admire about
                  Cameahwait's people. Lewis's <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were honest, well-behaved, and considerate. They would share
                  food with strangers without question even if there was little to go around. Lewis
                  admired their personal bravery and recognized the rough equality that made "every
                  man a chief." But at heart he saw <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> men and women not as adults but as mercurial and ignorant
                  children. Angry at the necessity for Indian support to cross Lemhi Pass, Lewis
                  lamented the fate of the expedition "which appeared at this moment to depend in a
                  great measure upon the caprice of a few savages who are ever as fickle as the
                  wind." When he watched some starving <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> eagerly eat raw venison, Lewis loftily wrote, "I really did
                  not untill now think that human nature ever presented itself in a shape so nearly
                  allyed to the brute creation."<ref target="n0636" n="36"/> Some of the American
                  party might have reminded the captain how tasty white pudding or <hi rend="italic">boudin blanc</hi>, made from buffalo intestines, was when prepared by the
                  skillful hands of Toussaint Charbonneau. Lewis's whole evaluation of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> personality can be seen in one vivid journal entry. Writing on
                  August 19, he declared that "from what has been said of the Shoshones it will be
                  readily perceived that they live in a wretched stait of poverty. Yet
                  notwithstanding their extreem poverty they are not only cheerful but even gay,
                  fond of gaudy dress and amusements; like most other Indians they are great
                  egotists and frequently boast of heroic acts which they never performed. They are
                  also fond of games of wrisk. They are frank, communicative, fair in dealing,
                  generous with the little they possess, extreemly honest, and by no means
                     beggarly."<ref target="n0637" n="37"/> Lewis's <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were guileless children, fond of dressing up, telling tall
                  tales, and too poor to know they ought to be unhappy without the blessings of
                  civilization.</p>
               <p> As Lewis made his catalog of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> culture, there was much he missed or misunderstood. During the
                  long Fort Mandan winter, Lewis and Clark had heard a good deal about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, especially from Hidatsa informants. Although the captains
                  understood that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> bands ranged over a wide territory, they did not know the
                  considerable variety and diversity among Shoshonean peoples. Using Sacagawea and
                  other northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> captives as models, Lewis and Clark first imagined the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> to be a plains people something like the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands but with a less warlike disposition. In fact, there were
                  two very distinct traditions, two ways that joined to make Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> life.</p>
               <p> Throughout the long days of searching for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> beyond Three Forks, Lewis and Clark thought only of horses.
                  But the mounted warrior and hunter was a quite recent development among
                  Shoshoneans. By far the older tradition in northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> life came out of the southern Great Basin, especially Nevada
                  and Utah. Indians of the southern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> lifeway lived in small family groups, were hunter-gatherers,
                  and built wickiup dwellings in a conical shape from brush and grass. Southern
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> did not have horses, nor did they focus their lives
                  on a warrior ideal. When Shoshoneans moved into Montana and Idaho some time in the
                  sixteenth century, they carried that Great Basin culture with them. When Lewis and
                  Clark saw Cameahwait's people eating fish and living in bruch wickiups, the
                  explorers were witnessing the persistence of old ways.</p>
               <p> But the northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were more than <hi rend="italic">ágaideka'a</hi>, salmon
                  eaters. In the years after 1700, with the introduction of the horse and contact
                  with plains cultures, there was a revolution in northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> life. That social and cultural upheaval turned pedestrian
                  small-game hunters and fishermen into equestrian hunters of the buffalo and
                  antelope. Changes in social values and organization paralleled the economic ones.
                  After 1700 the northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> developed a culture more like their plains neighbors than
                  their Great Basin relatives. By regional standards, most northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were not the poverty-striken people portrayed by the captains
                  but rather well-to-do, possessing material goods and horses beyond the imagination
                  of most Great Basin peoples. But the acceptance of the horse and some plains nomad
                  traits did not mean that the old ways disappeared. The two traditions were not
                  mutually exclusive. Lewis and Clark saw a people who scheduled their lives and
                  habits to suit salmon runs west of the divide and buffalo herds east of it. Lewis
                  provided in his journal entries a survey of the material culture of people whose
                  lives were poised between a Great Basin past and a plains present. Skin tepees and
                  brush lodges, salmon weirs and buffalo hunts all pointed to Indians who had
                  achieved a balance in a difficult land.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Sandwiched between Lewis's ethnographic work at Camp Fortunate and Clark's
                  difficult reconnaissance of the Salmon River country were two important
                  conferences with Cameahwait. Described by Clark as "a man of Influence Sence &amp;
                  easey &amp; reserved manners, [who] appears to possess a great deal of Cincerity,"
                  Cameahwait had proved to be a cooperative and friendly host.<ref target="n0638" n="38"/> The chief was willing to continue in that role, but he wanted specific
                  things from the expedition in return for his help. And he had no intention of
                  allowing the expedition's desires to thwart the needs of his people. All of this
                  became plain as Clark entered Cameahwait's Lemhi River village on August 20.
                  Ushered into the only skin tepee the band still had, Clark was fed berry cakes and
                  salmon before beginning his talk with the chief. First, the explorer needed
                  geographical information. The future of the expedition now depended on finding a
                  practical route to western waters, whether that path required horses or canoes.
                  Cameahwait listened intently to Clark's request for directions and then
                  constructed a detailed relief map depicting the Lemhi, Salmon, and Bitterroot
                  rivers as well as the Bitterroot Mountains. Cameahwait's report was both accurate
                  and discouraging. Pressed further by Clark, the chief mentioned for the first time
                  "persed nose Indians" who lived on a river "below the rocky mountains [which] ran
                  a great way toward the setting sun and finally lost itself in a great lake of
                  water which was illy tasted, and where the white men lived."</p>
               <p> That was just the sort of news Clark was looking for, but he was not yet prepared
                  to decide that this northwestern route was the most acceptable. Turning his
                  attention to an old man said by Cameahwait to know much about the lands to the
                  southwest, Clark asked him about possible trails to the sea in that direction.
                  What Clark got was an image of barren terrain filled with hostile Bannock Indians
                  and a route that eventually led to the Spanish domain. Promptly rejecting such a
                  path, Clark returned to the suggestions offered by Cameahwait. The chief indicated
                  that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> hunters made annual treks over the mountains to the
                  Missouri. Although Cameahwait insisted that "the road was a very bad one" and
                  lacked game, Clark quickly decided that if Indian hunters could make the crossing
                  on short rations his men could do the same.</p>
               <p> Cameahwait was certainly willing to provide Clark with vital geographical
                  information and a guide named Old Toby, but in the chief's mind the meeting had a
                  very different purpose. Faced with a food supply that was precarious and enemies
                  who were well armed, Cameahwait wanted a serious talk about <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> power, American trade, and plentiful supplies of manufactured
                  goods. Although the Atsinas, Blackfeet, and Hidatsas had a ready access to
                  firearms from Canadian traders, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were forced to rely on capturing an occasional gun. <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> trade, which centered on Spanish goods obtained either through
                  direct contact or Ute middlemen, did not provide the needed weapons. Spanish
                  borderlands policy sought to keep weapons out of native hands. What Spanish
                  policymakers saw as an effort to protect their borders and restrain Indians from
                  killing each other was perceived by Cameahwait as "leaving them defenceless and an
                  easy prey to their bloodthirsty neighbors to the east." Hunched over the council
                  fire, "his ferce eyes and lank jaws grown meager for want of food," Cameahwait
                  imagined how different <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> destinies would be if he and his warriors had American guns.
                  "We could then live in the country of the buffalo and eat as our enemies do and
                  not be compelled to hide ourselves in these mountains and live on roots and
                  berries as the bear do." Perhaps caught up in the intensity of that vision, Clark
                  made promises impossible to keep and destined to anger other plains people. The
                  explorer told Cameahwait that the Missouri River villagers had promised to stop
                  raiding the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Clark knew that Hidatsa war parties had left their villages
                  that very spring, but it was news he was not about to share. Restraining the
                  Hidatsas were not possible, nor was it realistic for Clark to promise that Atsina
                  and Blackfeet warriors might accept peace on the plains. Falling back on what was
                  now firm expedition policy, Clark promised that "whitemen would come to them with
                  an abundance of guns and every other article necessary to their defence and
                  comfort." All the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> needed to do was provide American traders with fur, and the
                  bounty of Western technology would be theirs. Clark did not realize that by arming
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and making them fur-trade allies, he ensured bitter
                  responses from the Blackfeet and the Atsinas.<ref target="n0639" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p> Two days later, as Clark's reconnaissance of the Salmon River country continued,
                  Cameahwait, Charbonneau, Sacagawea, and some fifty <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> men, along with unnumbered women and children, appeared at
                  Camp Fortunate. Now it was Lewis's turn to trade words with the chief. Although
                  the expedition's record for this meeting is not as full as for Clark's, it is
                  plain that Cameahwait once again emphasized his insecure position and its
                  consequences for the band's food supply. Lewis's reply was once again to stress
                  the value of American trade and the possiblities it offered <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> for a better life. Like Clark, Lewis made Cameahwait a
                  promise of guns. To satisfy more immediate needs, the explorer provided corn,
                  beans, and fish for the hungry band.<ref target="n0640" n="40"/> Had he been more
                  observant, the captain might have realized that the demands for food were running
                  counter to the needs of the expedition. At some point Cameahwait would be forced
                  to decide between feeding his people or continuing to provide support for the
                  explorers.</p>
               <p> On August 24, after some delays, Lewis finally moved out of Camp Fortunate. What
                  seemed to him an essential move must have worried Cameahwait. Just how long, he
                  may have wondered, would his band have to wait before leaving for the Three Forks
                  buffalo hunt? That worry grew into a full-scale confrontation with Lewis the
                  following day. Early in the morning of the 25th, Cameahwait quietly sent some of
                  his young warriors across the pass to the Lemhi River camp. These men were to
                  round up the rest of the band, and all would then travel to their eastern hunting
                  grounds. Cameahwait was not abandoning the expedition. He was simply responding to
                  a food crisis among his own people. But Lewis knew none of this until late in the
                  afternoon when Toussaint Charbonneau casually mentioned that he soon expected to
                  see all the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> on their way east. Lewis was furious with Charbonneau for
                  withholding vital information, but his real concern was to stop the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> move until the expedition was across the mountains and had the
                  horses it needed. Lewis knew he needed to act quickly. Calling Cameahwait and two
                  lesser chiefs to meet with him, the explorer bluntly asked whether they were
                  honorable men whose word could be trusted. He forcefully reminded the chiefs of
                  all their promises to aid the expedition across the divide and on to western
                  waters. Not content to challenge their honor, Lewis resorted to a direct threat.
                  "If they wished the whitemen to be their friends," he declared, "and to assist
                  them against their enemies by furnishing them with arms and keeping their enemies
                  from attacking them . . . they must never promise us anything which they did not
                  mean to perform." After an awkward silence, the two lesser chiefs claimed that the
                  decision was made by Cameahwait. Waiting a long time before replying, Cameahwait
                  admitted that his decision had been wrong. The chief explained that he "had been
                  induced to that measure from seeing all his people hungry." Lewis had seen the
                  hunger too and had commented on it repeatedly. Cameahwait's choice had not
                  deserved Lewis's harsh blast. That the chief finally chose honor over starvation
                  deserved more credit than Lewis was willing to grant.<ref target="n0641" n="41"/>

               <p> The last act in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> encounter was played out at the end of August when the
                  captains were reunited at the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> village on the Lemhi River. Once the explorers decided to
                  follow the advice of Old Toby and take their chances on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> path over the mountains, there was a flurry of horse trading.
                  Those days of bargaining reveal how quickly the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> learned to deal with the expedition as a captive market. In
                  the earliest days of the encounter, the Indians were so fascinated with the
                  explorers and their manufactured goods that they were willing to exchange a horse
                  for an old checked shirt, a pair of worn leggings, and a knife. "The Indians,"
                  wrote Lewis, "seemed quite as well pleased with their bargain as I was."<ref target="n0642" n="42"/> But <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> traders soon learned that they could get much more if they
                  bargained more sharply. On the day Lewis moved out of Camp Fortunate he noticed
                  some spare horses. Offering to trade for them, the explorer was bluntly told to
                  display his wares before business could begin. Ragged clothing and mirrors were
                  plainly not sufficient to attract the attention of the Indians. Digging deep into
                  his store of trade goods, Lewis came up with objects that had been the staple of
                  exchange at Fort Mandan. Those iron war axes that had so pleased village warriors
                  had a similar effect on the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. With the rate of exchange for horses now changing, Lewis was
                  compelled to offer a battle-axe, a knife, a handkerchief, and some paint for one
                  horse. For a Spanish mule, valued for its surefootedness, the American had to add
                  another knife and some clothing.<ref target="n0643" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p> Once over Lemhi Pass and at the Indian village, Lewis began serious trading. On
                  August 23, the first day of bargaining, it was plain that the free and easy days
                  of cheap horses were long gone. Lewis was forced to pay increasingly larger
                  amounts of merchandise for each horse. He had no choice but to accept the Indians'
                  demands. On the second trading lay, Lewis bought five or six more mounts and paid
                  a considerable price for each one. When Clark joined Lewis on August 29, he had to
                  offer his pistol, a knife, and one hundred rounds of ammunition for one horse.
                  Offering guns for horses was a sure indication of both the expedition's need and
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>' trading skill. Despite their best efforts, the
                  captains did not prove to be especially astute traders. When Clark carefully
                  examined the twenty-nine horses in the expedition's corral, he found them to be
                  "nearly all sore backs, and several pore, and young."<ref target="n0644" n="44"/>
                  Lewis and Clark had paid dearly for castoffs of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> herd. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> had proven to be better Yankee traders than the
                  Americans.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Led now by Old Toby, the expedition struggled along the north fork of the Salmon
                  River through country made difficult by heavy timber, steep hills, and dense
                  thickets. Progress was slowed as horses slipped and fell. A snow and sleet storm
                  made the going even more treacherous. The explorers had heard about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> Indians during the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> had indicated that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> might be met as the expedition moved north, but since the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> regularly joined <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> bands for hunting across the mountains at this season, a
                  meeting this late in the year seemed unlikely. Nevertheless, on September 4, as
                  the expedition crossed Lost Trail Pass and entered the Bitterroot Valley, the
                  Americans encountered a large <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> Indian camp in a place known later as Ross's Hole.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's progress toward the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> camp had not gone unnoticed. Early that morning and old chief
                  named Three Eagles had grown concerned about possible raiding parties who might
                  steal the band's horses. Out scouting during the day, Three Eagles was the first
                  to see the expedition. Hiding in the brush, he was both bewildered and concerned
                  by the sight. Here were men and horses moving along without any effort to conceal
                  their presence. Seeing that they had no blankets, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> assumed they were a group of travelers who had been robbed by
                  hostile Indians. Uncertain of the strangers' intention, he hurried back to camp to
                  warn his people.</p>
               <p> Still apprehensive about the strangers, Three Eagles returned to a stand of
                  timber where he could watch without being seen. As the Americans drew closer,
                  Three Eagles caught sight of York, whose face, he supposed, was painted black in
                  preparation for war. The Indian assumed that the expedition must have recently
                  emerged from a battle in which they had lost only their blankets. Now convinced
                  that the strangers would soon come upon the Indian camp, Three Eagles once again
                  returned to spread the warning. Because the expedition did not act like a war
                  party, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> chiefs decided to remain quiet and wait for the
                  strangers to arrive in the valley.<ref target="n0645" n="45"/>
               </p>
               <p> Throughout the day the expedition had seen fresh signs indicating that Indians
                  were nearby. Toward evening the party entered Ross's Hole and saw thirty-three
                  lodges dotting the valley floor. Already convinced that the Americans were not a
                  war party, the Indians greeted Lewis and Clark with a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> version of the "national hug" employed by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. While the captains were ceremoniously conducted to <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> tepees, the rest of the expedition was offered what little
                  food could be found. Because it was late, serious talk had to be postponed until
                  the following day.</p>
               <p> Those Indians whom Lewis and Clark and their men insisted on calling the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> were, in fact, Salish-speaking people. They later told the
                  captains that they were Ootlashoots of the Tushepaw nation. "Ootlashoot" was
                  probably from the Salish word for red willow, the native name for the Bitterroot
                  River. The name <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> proved to be a source of endless confusion from its first
                  appearance in the expedition's records. The Salish seen by Lewis and Clark did not
                  practice head flattening, a fact quickly pointed out by Clark in conversation with
                  Nicholas Biddle. The captains first heard about the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> while at Fort Mandan, and Clark's 1805 map places them
                  approximately where they were found in September 1805. The name <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> appears to have been the result of interpreting the visual
                  sign language gesture for the Salish. They were signed by pressing both sides of
                  the head with the hands in a flattening motion.</p>
               <p> Much of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> life was like the cycle of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> year. The Ootlashoots maintained close ties with the Lemhi
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and joined them each year for the Three Forks
                  buffalo hunt. <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> culture was an adoptive way of life. By the time the captains
                  came to Ross's Hole, these Salish speakers had created a lifeway that blended
                  their plateau past with many plains traits. After 1700, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> life became increasingly dominated by horse and buffalo
                  patterns. Perhaps the most significant difference between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> and their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> neighbors was language. Both Clark and Ordway noted the
                  difference on the first night in the valley. For Ordway, Salish speakers sounded
                  as if they were lisping or had "a bur on their tongue." The sergeant speculated
                  that this odd way of speaking meant the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> were really the long lost Welsh Indians! Without knowing it,
                  the expedition had passed from the Uto-Aztecan language family, to which <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> belonged, to the Salish family. What Clark graphically
                  described as "a gugling kind of language spoken much thro the throat" was in fact
                     Salish.<ref target="n0646" n="46"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark did not intend to spend much time among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref>. The Indians were in a hurry to join their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> hunting partners and the expedition was anxious to make their
                  mountain passage. Thursday, September 5, was a busy day filled with talk and
                  trade, both of which were made difficult by translation problems. Neither Old Toby
                  nor Sacagawea spoke Salish. As luck would have it, among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> was a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> boy who had been taken captive by some northern raiding party,
                  was later freed by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref>, and now lived with them. Using the boy's language skills,
                  the captains constructed a translation chain that required each word to pass
                  through the captains' English, Labiche's French, Charbonneau's Hidatsa,
                  Sacagawea's <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>, and on to the boy's Salish. By this cumbersom means, the
                  explorers briefly explained their mission, awarded several medals and flags, and
                  generally made friends. But the real business of the day was horse swapping. The
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> generously took a number of worn-out horses in
                  exchange for some of their healthy and "ellegant" ones. Twelve good mounts were
                  added to the expedition's herd. During the day Clark took time to note <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> hair and clothing styles, observing that they were quite
                  similar to <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> fashions. Whitehouse probably spoke for many when he
                  found the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> to be "the likelyest and honestst Savages we have
                  ever yet Seen."<ref target="n0647" n="47"/>
               </p>
               <p> The following day the expedition did some more horse dealing, adding two fine
                  animals to the herd. Meanwhile, Lewis struggled to draft a Salish vocabulary.
                  According to Whitehouse, many believed such a vocabulary would prove once and for
                  all time whether these Indians were descendants of Prince Madoc and the Welsh
                  Indians. Here so many miles from the Missouri were echoes still of that persistent
                  myth which had the power to capture the imaginations of men as different as John
                  Evans and Thomas Jefferson. Working in a steady drizzle, the expedition's horse
                  handlers hurried to lighten loads and tighten packsaddle cinches. At
                  mid-afternoon, as the rain let up, a memorable cavalcade marched out of Ross's
                  Hole. The expedition pressed on north while the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"

               <p> The next three weeks held some of the most demanding and dangerous days in the
                  history of the Corps of Discovery. After spending a brief time at Travelers' Rest,
                  the explorers turned west to hazard the Lolo Trail across the Bitterroot
                  Mountains. Talks with Old Toby and Cameahwait had prepared Lewis and Clark for a
                  difficult crossing. But information from two <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> met near Travelers' Rest had taken the sting out of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>' warnings. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> insisted that the trail took only five days and would bring
                  the expedition directly to Indians who were <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> relatives. Heartened by those words, the explorers marched out
                  to cross what Gass called "the most terrible mountains I ever beheld."<ref target="n0649" n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p> From the beginning, the Lolo Trail proved a cruel and unforgiving passage. A
                  clearly marked, well-traveled trail at the outset, it soon became a faint trace
                  often lost in a tangle of fallen timber and dense thickets. Serious trouble struck
                  on September 14 when Old Toby's memory failed and he led the party off the main
                  track, down a fishing path, and to the Lochsa River. On short rations already, the
                  expedition killed one of their horses and remembered how lost and hungry they were
                  by naming a nearby stream Killed Colt Creek. In order to rejoin the trail, the
                  explorers had to make a painful climb up the side of Wendover Ridge. Horses
                  slipped and fell, rolling down in tangles of brush and broken equipment. For
                  hungry and bone-tired explorers, the Lolo was already coming to symbolize the kind
                  of physical challenge they had not experienced since the days at the Great Falls
                  portage and on the Beaverhead River.</p>
               <p> Monday, September 16, was perhaps the grimmest day in the expedition's memory.
                  Sleeping on any level places they could find, the explorers awoke to find
                  themselves covered with a heavy blanket of snow. Whitehouse caught the general
                  mood that morning as he watched men without stockings fumble in the cold to wrap
                  rags around already numb feet. Gasping for breath in the thin air, the expedition
                  marched thirteen painful miles "with grat dificulty." Clark, never one to complain
                  in the face of adversity, admitted, "I have [never] been [as] wet and as cold in
                  every part . . . in my life." With no end in sight, there would be another night
                  sleeping in the snow and struggling to survive on meager rations.</p>
               <p> By the night of September 17, it was plain that drastic measures had to be taken.
                  The expedition was nearing the limits of its physical endurance. Believing that
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> territories were just ahead, the captains decided
                  that Clark would press ahead with a small band of hunters while Lewis worked to
                  bring along the main group. On the morning of September 18, Clark and his men set
                  out toward a broad valley they could see in the distance. Ahead lay two more days
                  of difficult going. Rescue from the bitter snows was now at hand, but few would
                  forget what Gass called "this horrible mountainous desert."<ref target="n0650" n="50"/>
               </p>
               <p> Sometime on September 20, Clark and his hunters at last escaped the Lolo Trail
                  and broke out on a small upland plain known afterward as Weippe Prairie. Long a
                  gathering place for <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> families to dig and cook camas roots and fish in the nearby
                  Clearwater River, the prairie was filled with signs of Indian activity. Riding
                  some three miles through the plain, Clark and his men could see many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> lodges in the distance. When the Americans were within a mile
                  of the first cluster of lodges, they suddenly came upon three young Indians.
                  Seeing the strangers and fearing a raid, the boys scattered and hid in the high
                  prairie grass. Clark worried lest they alarm the village and make the first
                     expedition-<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> meeting a troubled one. He quickly dismounted, handed his gun
                  to one of the hunters, and began to search the tall grass. That hasty search
                  turned up two very frightened boys. To quiet their fears, Clark gave each one
                  several small pieces of ribbon and then urged them with gestures to announce the
                  arrival of friendly visitors in their village.</p>
               <p> Clark's party waited nervously as the boys hurried away. A short time later, one
                  man emerged from the village and walked cautiously toward the explorers. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> used signs to invite the Americans into a large tepee. He
                  explained that the lodge belonged to the band's chief Broken Arm, now absent on a
                  raid. Most of the men in the band were with the chief and would not return for two
                  weeks. By now Clark and his men were surrounded by a few elderly men and many
                  women, all eager to see the bearded strangers. Although the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> had heard about white men, only a handful had ever seen
                  them. Clark sensed that curious <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> eyes betrayed both fear and genuine pleasure. Why they might
                  have been pleased to greet the Corps of Discovery did not become clear until
                  later. But now food was the order of the day and pieces of buffalo, dried salmon,
                  and camas bread were passed around. Not knowing the consequences of that diet,
                  Clark and the others ate the camas with unthinking abandon. After handing out a
                  few small gifts, the captain moved on to the second <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> camp.</p>
               <p> At the second camp, a cluster of fifteen lodges, Clark finally had time to take
                  note of the Indians around him. Although <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> dress and ways seemed similar to what he had seen at Ross's
                  Hole, Clark's ears told him that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> language was quite different from the Salish spoken by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref>. Without knowing it, the explorers had crossed an important
                  linguistic boundary and were now in the territory of Sahaptian speakers. Clark
                  recorded that these Indians called themselves "Chopunnish or Pierced noses."
                  Chopunnish may have been Clark's fractured effort to spell "Sahaptian," the Salish
                  word used by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> and their neighbors to describe the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> as "those who lived to the south."<ref target="n0651" n="51"/> Looking at <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> men, Clark found them large and "portly" while the women
                  appeared small and "handsome featured." With an eye toward future trade, Clark
                  noted <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> bead-color preferences (blue and white) and the
                  ornamental uses for brass and copper. Perhaps remembering how good camas bread
                  tasted, Clark took time to record the method Indian women used to steam the roots
                  and prepare the bread. Later in the evening the explorer began to regret his
                  healthy appetite. As it would for days, the root bread produced diarrhea and
                  painful intestinal gas. Clark may have made a mental note to warn Lewis not to eat
                  the bread!<ref target="n0652" n="52"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the following day, Clark dispatched hunters to find something to vary the
                  camas and fish diet while he stayed with his <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> host. The captain hoped to settle any Indian fears about the
                  expedition's intentions and obtain much needed information about the route ahead.
                  Anxious to help, a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chief drew a hasty chart of the Clearwater and Snake rivers.
                  Clark was told about the Great Falls of the Columbia and also led to believe that
                  whites lived at the falls, where the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> obtained beads and metal goods. Although the Indians did
                  trade for beads, copper, and brass at The Dalles and Celilo Falls, there were, in
                  fact, no white traders in the territory so jealously guarded by Wishram and Wasco
                  Indian middlemen. Probably a misinterpretation of sign language was to blame here.
                  When Clark asked for additional information, he was told that a more important
                  chief named Twisted Hair was at a fishing camp farther up the Clearwater. After
                  purchasing some extra provisions and sending Reuben Field back toward the Lolo
                  Trail to locate Lewis, he made his way to Twisted Hair's camp.</p>
               <p> Traveling over unfamiliar ground without an Indian guide, Clark became lost in
                  the darkness. Fortunately, he stumbled on a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> man who was willing for the price of one handkerchief to
                  direct the explorer toward Twisted Hair's camp. It was close to midnight when
                  Clark finally reached the fishing camp. Twisted Hair, properly known as
                  Walammottinin, meaning "hair or forelock bunched and tied," was about sixty-five
                  years old, "a Cheerful man with apparant siencerity." Clark's first meeting with
                  Twisted Hair was cordial, and both men smoked together well into the night.</p>
               <p> Among the women and children at Twisted Hair's camp was an elderly woman named
                  Watkuweis. In the first draft of his journal for that day, Clark took note of her
                  presence, explaining that she "had formerly been taken by the Minitarries of the
                  North &amp; seen white men." Her name did not appear in his revised journal entry.
                  Clark did not know how important the old woman had been in insuring a friendly
                  reception for the expedition. Watkuweis, whose name meant "returned from a far
                  country," had been captured by Blackfeet or Atsina raiders sometime late in the
                  eighteenth century. Taken into Canada, she had been purchased by a trader and had
                  lived for several years among whites before finding her way home. Watkuweis had
                  been treated well and had never lost her favorable impression of whites. When
                  Clark came to Twisted Hair's camp, Watkuweis urged her people to treat the
                  expedition with all hospitality. <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> oral tradition records that when Watkuweis heard of Clark's
                  arrival, she said, "These are the people who helped me. Do them no hurt."<ref target="n0653" n="53"/>
               </p>
               <p> But the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> welcome was based on more than the word of a former
                  captive. Like their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> neighbors, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> bands were desperate to obtain guns and ammunition. As
                  weapons from Canadian traders fell into Blackfeet and Atsina hands, Indians
                  without firearms found their situation increasingly precarious. <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> buffalo hunters were threatened, and undefended villages were
                  at risk. Faced with an urgent need to find guns, three warriors from Broken Arm's
                  band had joined <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref> traders in a journey to the Knife River Hidatsa towns. That trip,
                  made in the spring of 1805, brought the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> their first six guns as well as news of Lewis and Clark.
                  More than anything else, it was the need for guns that conditioned the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>' behavior toward the expedition. The desire for trade and
                  the words of Watkuweis made the expedition's first encounter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> a friendly one.<ref target="n0654" n="54"/>
               </p>
               <p> September 22 was the day of grand reunion for the Lewis and Clark parties. While
                  Clark spent most of the morning with Twisted Hair and his son, Lewis and his
                  contingent traveled the last few painful miles along the Lolo Trail. Early in the
                  afternoon, the main party came off the trail and was met by Reuben Field. At about
                  five o'clock, Lewis's group reached the first Weippe Prairie village. When all the
                  Indian women hurried to gather their children and flee on horseback into the
                  woods, Lewis was plainly worried since Clark was supposed to have prepared the
                  Indians for his arrival. Lewis feared that moving the women and children out of
                  range now was the first step in a hostile action. But his fears were stemmed when
                  several unarmed men emerged from the village carrying gifts of camas bread for the
                  expedition.</p>
               <p> Just at sunset, Clark walked up to the first <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> village to find the main party "much fatigued and hungry."
                  Recalling his own unpleasant experience with the camas bread and fish diet, Clark
                  "cautioned them of the consequences of eating too much." In the twilight, Weippe
                  Prairie was covered with inquisitive <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, all anxious to catch a glimpse of the strangers and their
                  fascinating equipment. That fascination was evidently too much for some <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> because later Reuben Field discovered his knife, compass,
                  fire steel, and gun wiping rod were missing. Ready to overlook minor pilfering,
                  Lewis and Clark were intent on obtaining accurate geographical information from
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. But communication was difficult since neither Old
                  Toby nor Sacagawea could speak <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref>. Although forced to rely on sign language, the captains
                  managed to obtain valuable data about the way ahead. Twisted Hair took a whitened
                  elk skin and drew an accurate map of the rivers that would take the expedition to
                  the Columbia. The chief claimed a bit optimistically that five days of travel
                  would take the Americans to the Falls of the Columbia and places where white
                  traders lived. Always the cautious cartographer, Clark finished the evening
                  gathering "maps of the Country &amp; river with the Situation of Indians, Towns
                  from Several men of note Seperately which varied verry little."<ref target="n0655" n="55"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark did not intend to remain long among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, no matter how friendly they were. With the Columbia and
                  Pacific waters so close, the explorers were anxious to find winter quarters
                  somewhere along the coast. The expedition's most immediate needs were to replenish
                  food supplies and exchange horses for canoes. There might be time for some ritual
                  diplomacy, but linguistic and ethnographic studies would have to wait until the
                  return trip. On September 23, Lewis and Clark called a council at the first <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> village. Although Broken Arm was still absent on a raid,
                  other chiefs joined Twisted Hair in listening to the captains recite the usual
                  formulas of United States Indian policy. But efforts to inform the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs of American intentions were hampered by translation
                  problems and once again all relied on Drouillard's signs. With serious diplomacy
                  cut to a minimum, gifts of tobacco, clothing, flags, and medals had to convey the
                  expedition's message. Just what Twisted Hair and his fellow chiefs gathered from
                  the conference remains unclear, but Clark claimed that the gifts and American
                  policies "appeared to satisfy them much." Determined to cultivate friendship with
                  the Americans, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> diplomats might have been more satisfied with direct talk
                  about guns.</p>
               <p> While the diplomats were occupied in exchanging gestures and gifts, most of the
                  expedition was busy trading for food and getting to know their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> neighbors. John Ordway's usual eye for telling details did
                  not fail him as he caught sight of copper kettles and other metal goods obtained
                  from middle Columbia traders. The sergeant also noticed something that indicated
                  the adoptive nature of so many plateau peoples: among the plains-style skin tepees
                  were reed or "flag" lodges reminiscent of those seen in <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> country. But ethnography was not the order of the day. Trade
                  for camas, dried fish, and berries was far more important, and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were eager to barter for precious cloth and metal. Blue
                  beads were the most sought-after commodity, but Whitehouse saw real Indian
                  interest in "a small piece of red cloth, as wide as a mans hand." Although Clark
                  later complained that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were "very selfish and stingey," both peoples appeared
                  pleased with their trade bargains.<ref target="n0656" n="56"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark planned to brand their horses, leave them with the Indians, and
                  begin canoe building as quickly as possible. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were no hindrance to that plan, but their food was. In the
                  evening after the conference, Lewis and two men began to suffer from severe
                  gastrointestinal distress. Whether it was the change in diet or bacteria in the
                  food is not clear, but the consequences were serious. Constant debilitating
                  diarrhea and gas pains sometimes so pressing as to make breathing difficult
                  afflicted others in the expedition. On September 24, when the captains wanted to
                  get closer to the Clearwater River, many men were sick and Lewis himself was
                  "scarcely able to ride on a jentle horse." Explorers who had weathered the Great
                  Falls portage and the Lolo Trail were now lying along the path doubled over with
                  pain and too weak to walk.<ref target="n0657" n="57"/> Despite the fact that he
                  was still unwell, Clark joined Twisted Hair and two of his sons in searching for
                  good canoe timber and a boat-building site close to the river. The place they
                  found was a narrow pine bottom on the south side of the river, opposite the
                  junction of the north fork of the Clearwater and the main stem.</p>
               <p> Despite widespread illness, the expedition made their canoe-building camp on
                  September 26 and began to work. It quickly became apparent that the small axes
                  Clark distributed were simply inadequate for the task. Not enough able workers and
                  the wrong tools made progress slow. Looking to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> for help, the expedition followed Indian practice in making
                  dugout canoes by burning the centers of the logs. Even with that labor-saving
                  technique, it took the Americans ten days to construct five canoes. If <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> technology made the construction possible, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> skill of another sort was to be available for the journey on
                  to the Columbia. Twisted Hair and a younger chief named Tetoharsky had promised to
                  accompany the expedition and serve as intermediaries between the explorers and the
                  Sahaptian-speaking peoples.<ref target="n0658" n="58"/>
               </p>
               <p> Toward midafternoon on October 7, the Lewis and Clark expedition was at last
                  prepared to begin the final leg of its journey to the western sea. With canoes
                  loaded, balanced, and in the water, all seemed ready to seek the Columbia and a
                  saltwater tide. Disappointed that the two <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs had not yet appeared, the captains decided that they
                  could wait no longer. It was not until the next day that Twisted Hair and
                  Tetoharsky joined the expedition. No sooner had the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides appeared than Old Toby and his son left. Deciding that
                  their term of enlistment was complete, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were last seen running along the river bank, having neither
                  announced their departure nor waited to be paid. Just why Old Toby fled is not
                  clear, although Gass believed that a canoe accident in dangerous rapids earlier in
                  the day frightened the Indian. Old Toby may have been equally concerned about
                  traveling farther among unknown and potentially hostile tribes.<ref target="n0659" n="59"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the night that Old Toby slipped away, the expedition and its Indian contingent
                  stopped to make camp along the Clearwater River. Feeling stronger now and filled
                  with the expectation that their canoes would soon ride in saltwater, the explorers
                  were ready to celebrate. Gathered around blazing fires, they joined hands with the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> and "were very merry." The whine of Pierre
                  Cruzatte's fiddle and the shouts of dancing men cut the chilly air. Frenchmen like
                  Labiche and Drouillard enjoyed roasted dog while others picked at salmon and camas
                  staples. But the night suddenly became stranger when a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> woman was seized by an apparent fit. Shouting and singing,
                  she attempted to give gifts of camas roots and brass bracelets to one of the
                  startled Americans. When the gifts were refused, the woman angrily cut her arms
                  with sharp flint. What Clark and Ordway recorded as a seizure was perhaps the
                  woman's <hi rend="italic">Wyakin</hi> or guardian spirit at work. Whatever the
                  cause, the entire night was both festive and disconcerting.<ref target="n0660" n="60"/> In the firelight and shadows it was time to remember how far they had
                  all come since the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. While Cruzatte's fiddle music accompanied <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> shrieks, there may have been a moment to recall Cameahwait's
                  lean face as he talked about guns or to recall the strange gurgling sound of
                  Salish speakers at Ross's Hole, who many thought were the long-lost Welsh Indians.
                  But retrospective romance was never the stock-in-trade of the expedition. Tomorrow
                  promised to be another demanding day on the river. </p>

               <p> When Lewis and Clark pulled out of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> Clearwater villages in boats in early October, they were
                  moving toward worlds wholly unlike any they had yet experienced. In the next two
                  months the expedition left the mountains and ponderosa pines of the plateau and
                  sailed through the awesome and seemingly desolate Columbia Plain. Navigating
                  hazardous rivers, the Corps of Discovery paddled the Clearwater to the Snake and
                  on at last to the Columbia. Driven to reach the western sea before winter and
                  challenged by treacherous white water, Lewis and Clark had little time to describe
                  the dark-walled canyons and treeless plains around them. But in one memorable
                  passage, Clark tried to capture something of the strange landscape. "The face of
                  the Countrey on both Side of the river above and about the falls," wrote the
                  captain, "is Steep ruged and rockey open and contain but a Small preportion of
                  herbage, no timber a fiew bushes excepted."<ref target="n0701" n="1"/> But below
                  the Cascades of the Columbia the terrain and climate once again changed
                  dramatically. Rain, fog, and dense ground cover all signaled that Lewis and Clark
                  had at last reached a marine environment. They were in territory that received
                  more than sixty inches of rain annually, more than six times the amount that fell
                  on the land they had seen around The Dalles. Days marked by high winds, terrifying
                  storms, monotonous meals of pounded salmon, and a damp that rotted clothing and
                  tents pointed to what lay ahead during the winter at Fort Clatsop.<ref target="n0702" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p> Moving through climates and landforms striking for their abrupt changes tested
                  the expedition's endurance, as did the Columbia itself. But even more striking
                  were the physical and cultural differences among the Indians down the river and
                  toward the coast. At the confluence of the Snake and the Columbia, Lewis and Clark
                  entered an Indian world increasingly distant from the plains traditions that had
                  been so much a part of expedition-Indian relations since those early days along
                  the Missouri. On the Columbia, salmon was king and fishing the enterprise that
                  gave shape to native life. Large houses with wooden frames, clothing a strange
                  admixture of native and European fashions, graceful canoes with "curious images"
                  at their bows, and practices like head-flattening—all pointed to a native
                  environment dominated by Pacific ways.</p>
               <p> To these sights were added the strange clucking sounds of the Chinookan speakers
                  and the smells of tons of stacked salmon drying in warm winds blowing up the
                  Columbia gorge. In flea-infested plank houses or at hastily made camps along the
                  river, Lewis and Clark contended with Indians long accustomed to dealing with
                  English, American, and native traders. The Columbia River Sahaptians and
                  Chinookans could outbargain the sharpest Yankee in dealing for dog meat or
                  precious firewood. In those transactions it was the Indian middleman—whether
                  Wishram or Chinook—who expected to set the price, while outsiders of
                  whatever cultural stripe were to pay or go without. An unfamiliar material culture
                  coupled with hard bargaining methods a bit too close to home hinted that relations
                  with the Indians in the Pacific Northwest were going to be distant at best and
                  troubled at worst.</p>
               <p> But much if not all of this was unimagined during the first days of travel beyond
                  Canoe Camp. For nearly a week the expedition struggled with the twists, turns, and
                  rapids of the Clearwater and Snake. As Lewis and Clark neared the Columbia-Snake
                  confluence, they constantly had to deal with dangerous rocks, capsized canoes, and
                  wet gear. Fully occupied in navigating through the many Snake River rapids, the
                  explorers perhaps missed the subtle signs that they were approaching the eastern
                  edge of the great Columbia Plain. One indication they did record was the growing
                  scarcity of firewood. The Indians who lived along the Clearwater and upper Snake
                  very carefully gathered and stacked whatever wood was available. On October 14, at
                  Pinetree Rapids on the Snake some thirty miles below the Palouse River, the
                  Americans were so short of wood that they asked their two <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides for permission to take and burn some of the Indians'
                     wood.<ref target="n0703" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p> If hints of coming changes in land and climate in land and climate were
                  overlooked, it was harder to miss the human clues pointing to a life where salmon
                  replaced buffalo. During the six days before coming to the Columbia, the party
                  passed dozens of fishing villages. Those villages, typically containing four brush
                  lodges, were located about eight to ten miles apart at good fishing runs. In the
                  summer, lodges were built with willows and rushes in a style that may have
                  reminded the explorers of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> wickiups. Winter lodges made with split pine rails wore a more
                  permanent face. Attracting more of the expedition's attention were the graveyards
                  prominently located in many villages. Unlike scaffold burial places seen on the
                  plains, these cemeteries were marked by picket fences surrounding bodies interred
                  in the earth.<ref target="n0704" n="4"/>
               </p>
               <p> From their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides Lewis and Clark knew that they were quite close to the
                  Snake-Columbia confluence and the territories of Indians having little contact
                  with whites. Thus informed, the captains prepared for what proved to be the first
                  of many meetings with Indians down the Columbia. Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky were
                  sent ahead on October 14 to announce the expedition's advance. Those Sahaptians
                  scouted by the chiefs were known to Lewis and Clark as Sokulks and Chimnapams. The
                  Sokulks proved to be Wanapams who lived on the Columbia above the Snake-Columbia
                  confluence, while the Chimnapams were Yakimas whose villages dotted the great
                  river around present-day Pasco, Washington.<ref target="n0705" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p> Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky did their advance work skillfully; on October 16 near
                  the Snake-Columbia junction, Clark saw five Indians coming upriver "in great
                  haste." Anxious to make a good first impression, the captains brought out tobacco
                  and smoked with the new arrivals. Each was given additional tobacco to distribute
                  among other Indians. The native party, either Yakimas from nearby villages or
                  visiting Wanapams, eagerly took the tobacco and hurried back to spread the news of
                  an impending great event.</p>
               <p> By midday the expedition was at the Snake-Columbia confluence and, as had so
                  often happened on the Upper Missouri, the Americans quickly became objects of
                  intense curiosity. Scores of Yakimas and Wanapams lined the riverbanks to stare in
                  astonishment at the bearded strangers and all their fascinating baggage. Those
                  Indian sightseers bold enough to approach Lewis and Clark were rewarded with small
                  twists of tobacco. As the Indians watched closely, the explorers made camp and
                  waited for official delegations from the river peoples.</p>
               <p> Later in the evening, the expedition was treated to a spectacle the likes of
                  which they had not seen since their grand welcome by Cameahwait's <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Led by their chief Cutssahnem, two hundred Wanapam men came
                  striding into the American camp singing and beating on small drums. In the
                  firelight the Wanapams formed a half circle and continued to chant a festive
                  greeting. After the obligatory smoke, the captains got down to serious talk with
                  Cutssahnem. But as was so often the case in the Northwest, Lewis and Clark were
                  handicapped by translation difficulties. American intentions were explained in
                  signs to Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky, who then had to be relied upon to present a
                  faithful summary to their fellow Sahaptian speakers. Lewis and Clark wanted the
                  Wanapams and Yakimas to know "our friendly disposition to all nations, and our joy
                  in Seeing those of our friendly Children around us." If the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> translators failed to get the message across, the explorers
                  knew from long experience that gifts were a powerful declaration of "friendly
                  disposition." For Cutssahnem there was a large medal, a shirt, and a handkerchief.
                  An unnamed "second chief" and a headman from one of the Wanapam villages were
                  given smaller medals. With all parties properly welcomed and in good spirits, the
                  Americans ended the day by purchasing eight fat dogs, some dried salmon, and
                  twenty pounds of dried horsemeat.<ref target="n0706" n="6"/>
               </p>
               <p> The junction of the Snake and the Columbia rivers had long been a favorite place
                  for Yakimas and Wanapams to gather for fishing, trading, and visiting. Lewis and
                  Clark decided to camp for an additional day or two at the junction to repair
                  broken equipment, dry dampened papers, and purchase additional provisions. On the
                  morning of October 17, while Cutssahnem and several of his principal men traded
                  dogs and vocabulary phrases with Lewis, Clark took two men in a small canoe for a
                  short reconnaisance up the Columbia. The mat-lodge fishing villages and drying
                  scaffolds he saw along the banks were of the sort that would be described in the
                  expedition's records for many days to come. At one cluster of lodges, Clark
                  stopped for a closer look. In one house he found a busy crowd of men, women, and
                  children. Seemingly unafraid of their uninvited guest, the Wanapams politely
                  offered Clark a sitting mat and some boiled salmon "on a platter of rushes neetly
                  made." As Clark enjoyed his meal and the good company, he took careful note of his
                  hosts' clothing, manners, and physical characteristics.</p>
               <p> Once back at camp, Clark found time to write an extended commentary on the river
                  folk. Following the categories that were now an integral part of expedition
                  ethnography, he described their bodies, dress, and houses. His observations on
                  Wanapam and Yakima clothing and ornament were written with his characteristic eye
                  for detail. What especially captured Clark's attention that day were three barely
                  related but arresting facets of native life. Following directions from Jefferson
                  and Rush that economic relations between males and females be carefully noted, the
                  explorers generally repeated the white wisdom proclaiming Indian women "squaw
                  drudges" to tyrannical husbands. Along the Columbia, the explorers found societies
                  in which the sharing of labor between men and women was much more in evidence.
                  Those societies placed considerable emphasis on age and wisdom. At one mat lodge
                  Clark met a centenarian who sat at the best place in the house, and "when She
                  spoke great attention was paid to what she said." Mat lodges, so unlike Mandan
                  earth lodges or plains tepees, also called for written description. Later in their
                  Columbia voyage, the explorers would see large plank houses and pit dwellings, but
                  from the Snake-Columbia confluence to The Dalles mat lodges were the most common
                  native architecture. Clark noted that the houses measured from fifteen to sixty
                  feet long and were "generally of an oblong sqare form." The whole dwelling was
                  supported by interior poles and forks. Openings along the roof allowed smoke from
                  cooking fires to escape. Quick to see the relationship between house design and
                  climate, Clark noted that flat roofs "proves to me that rains are not common in
                  this open country." Perhaps thinking of the kinds of medical information so
                  eagerly sought by Benjamin Rush, Clark recorded the eye ailments and dental
                  peculiarities present among river people. Looking over his new-found native
                  friends, the explorer pronounced them "of a mild disposition and friendly
                     disposed."<ref target="n0707" n="7"/>
               </p>
               <p> The time taken with Indians at the Snake-Columbia junction was well spent because
                  it allowed for repairing equipment and gathering vital geographic information.
                  From Cutssahnem the explorers obtained a charcoal-on-skin map "of the rivers and
                  Tribes above on the great river and its waters on which he put great numbers of
                  villages of his nation and friends." An unnamed Yakima chief who joined the
                  council on October 18 offered a second map of the same territory and its people.
                  These maps and the numbers of people seen around the confluence made it plain to
                  Lewis and Clark that daily encounters with Indians were to be expected. As the
                  expedition left the junction and began to navigate the Columbia, Twisted Hair and
                  Tetoharsky were sent on ahead again to prepare the way. When the two <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> scouts returned later in the day and found the expedition
                  past the Walla Walla River and ready to camp in present-day Washington, they
                  carried news of chief Yelleppit and the Walla Walla Indians.<ref target="n0708" n="8"/>
               </p>
               <p> Relayed by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides, the greeting Lewis and Clark got that evening from
                  the Walulas or Walla Wallas and their chief Yelleppit was as enthusiastic as that
                  offered earlier by Cutssahnem and his kin. Yelleppit's message of welcome included
                  an offer of scarce firewood as an additional sign of friendship. Later that night
                  the chief and some twenty of his men came upriver and made camp a short distance
                  from the explorers.</p>
               <p> Early the next morning Yelleppit, two other Walula chiefs, and a chief from
                  either a Cayuse or a Umatilla band appeared in camp for a grand council. Yelleppit
                  was an imposing figure, described by Clark as "a bold handsom Indian, with a
                  dignified countenance about 35 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high and well
                  perpotioned." Struggling as always with translations, the explorer-diplomats did
                  the best they could with signs to convey their "friendly intentions towards our
                  red children perticelar those who opened their ears to our Councils." Lewis and
                  Clark's words were not recorded, but the Walula chief probably heard the usual
                  diplomatic speech directed to Indians. Presentations of a medal, a handkerchief,
                  some wampum for Yelleppit, and additional strings of wampum for the other chiefs
                  were all part of the expedition's good-will ritual.</p>
               <p> Fascinated by the explorers and impressed with their store of goods, Yelleppit
                  asked them to remain a day longer so that all his people could see them. His
                  request betrayed something more than just native curiosity about whites. The chief
                  had his eye on the weapons and goods carried by the explorers. If European objects
                  were already in Walula hands (and no expedition diarist mentioned seeing any such
                  until further downriver) they surely came from other Indian traders. Like the
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> or Arikaras who hoped to keep the explorers and their
                  goods from moving on, so too did Yelleppit seek to persuade Lewis and Clark to
                  remain a while longer. The chief's search for European goods would continue for
                  years after the captains politely rejected his request. When David Thompson
                  visited Yelleppit in July 1811, the chief made the same kind of request. In
                  addition, Yelleppit wanted Thompson to build a trading house at the Snake-Columbia
                     confluence.<ref target="n0709" n="9"/>
               </p>
               <p> As the expedition continued down the Columbia and neared the mouth of the
                  Umatilla River, Indian reactions began to change dramatically. The welcomes
                  offered by Cutssahnem and Yelleppit vanished and were replaced first by fear and
                  then by ill-concealed hostility. That fear became evident during the afternoon of
                  October 19 as the explorers left Walula territory and entered that occupied by
                  Umatillas. Throughout the afternoon, the men saw hastily abandoned villages and
                  frightened Indians. "At our approach," said Clark, "they hid themselves in their
                  Lodges and not one was to be seen until we passed." Although the expedition's
                  records offer no straightforward explanation for this sudden shift in native
                  attitudes, an event later in that afternoon does suggest how Indians with little
                  or no contact with whites responded to the expedition.</p>
               <p> As Clark was walking on shore with a small party that included Charbonneau,
                  Sacagawea, and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides, he idly shot a crane. Clark thought no more about the
                  incident. A cluster of mat lodges in the distance seemed more worthy of attention.
                  Indians from those lodges were spotted running in terror back to their village.
                  Anxious to quiet the Umatillas' fears, Clark decided to take Drouillard and the
                  Field brothers on a visit. Once at the settlement, they found five mat houses with
                  their doors firmly shut. Pipe in hand, Clark pushed his way into the first lodge
                  and found thirty-two men, women, and children "in the greatest agutation." As the
                  Indians cried, wrung their hands, and lowered their heads in preparation for
                  death, Clark struggled to allay their fears. Handshaking, a proffered pipe, and
                  gifts eventually soothed them. He repeated the performance at the other lodges
                  and, with the help of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs and the presence of Sacagawea, terror passed into what
                  he claimed was "greatest friendship." Then the Umatillas spilled out the reason
                  for their fear. As Clark explained it later to Nicholas Biddle, "The alarm was
                  occasioned by their thinking that we were supernatural and came down from the
                  clouds." The Umatilla perception of Lewis and Clark as sky gods had been sparked
                  by Clark's random killing of the crane. "These shots (having never heard a gun), a
                  few light clouds passing, the fall of the birds and our immediately landing and
                  coming towards them convinced them we were from above."<ref target="n0710" n="10"/>
               </p>
               <p> As the expedition moved closer to Celilo Falls and The Dalles, the Indians
                  continued to show signs of fear and distrust. Perhaps the outsiders were
                  identified with Paiute warriors who frequently raided in the region. For whatever
                  reason, the river people traded warily with Lewis and Clark. Ordway recalled that
                  these Indians acted "as if they were in fear of us."<ref target="n0711" n="11"/>
               </p>
               <p> Noting that edginess, members of the party stayed close to their weapons, but
                  something else increasingly captured their attention. On October 20, Clark saw the
                  first piece of European clothing, a "salors jacket," on a river Indian. Even more
                  trade goods were in evidence when the explorers visited the Upper Memaloose
                  Islands. Known as the "place of the departed," the islands contained many large
                  burial vaults filled not only with human and equestrian remains but with all sorts
                  of trade goods of European manufacture. That those grave offerings were part of
                  native daily life was verified when the explorers stopped at an Indian camp to
                  purchase fish and found "some articles which showed that white people had been
                  here or not far distant during the summer." By the time Lewis and Clark were
                  around the John Day River, non-Indian clothing and implements were everywhere.<ref target="n0712" n="12"/>
               </p>
               <p> Sailors' overalls, brass bracelets, tea kettles, and scarlet blankets all pointed
                  to the presence of a vast trade network centered at The Dalles of the Columbia.
                  Although Lewis and Clark did not yet know it, they were about to encounter that
                  center and cross a fundamental cultural and linguistic boundary. Just as the
                  Middle Missouri trade network and the people involved in it had a profound impact
                  on the expedition, so did the Pacific-Plateau system dominate Indian-explorer
                  relations around The Dalles and down the Columbia. Understanding the
                  Pacific-Plateau economic and cultural network is essential for comprehending the
                  often tangled and tense encounters between river Indians and the American
                  party.</p>
               <p> On the broadest level, the Pacific-Plateau system involved exchanging huge
                  quantities of dried salmon for other food and trade goods. What corn and buffalo
                  were to the Missouri villagers, dried fish was to the Wishram and Wasco merchants
                  at The Dalles. Stretching from the Pacific coast to <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> territories and linked to the Middle Missouri system by way
                  of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> Rendezvous, the network joined Chinookan and
                  Sahaptian-speaking peoples in an intricate set of personal and economic
                  relationships. Through the trade system flowed not only fish, wappato bread,
                  buffalo robes, and European goods but also games, songs, and stories. Preserving
                  the system met the needs not only of The Dalles middlemen but also their more
                  distant Chinookan and Sahaptian trading partners.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> Geography, in the form of a dramatic narrowing of the Columbia at The Dalles and
                  the resulting creation of ideal fishing stations, conspired with
                  weather—warm dry winds blowing up the gorge—to make the Indian
                  villages around the Long and Short Narrows, in Clark's words, "great mart[s] of
                     trade."<ref target="n0713" n="13"/> The Wishram Indians lived on the north bank
                  at The Dalles; the Wascos occupied sites on the south side of the river. Although
                  trading and fishing took place from Celilo Falls down to The Dalles, the most
                  intense bargaining was done at the main Wishram village of Nix-luidix. That
                  village, whose name meant "trading place," was located at the head of the Long
                  Narrows. When Lewis and Clark visited it on October 24, they found some twenty
                  large wooden plank houses. Each plank dwelling held three Wishram families. Asked
                  by the explorers who they were, the Wishrams replied, "i'tcxluit," meaning "I am
                  Ita'xluit." That phrase sounded like Echeloot to American ears; hence the
                  expedition's maps and journals always referred to the Wishrams as Echeloots.</p>
               <p> The towering stacks of dried salmon at Nixluidix, estimated by Clark at about ten
                  thousand pounds, pointed up the vast quantities of goods exchanged in the
                  Pacific-Plateau network. Trading took place from spring through fall during the
                  three major salmon runs, with most activity reserved for the fall season. During
                  September and October dried fish and roots were freshly prepared and in abundant
                  supply. To The Dalles trade fair came the nearby Yakimas and Teninos as well as
                  the more distant Umatillas, Walulas, and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. Local Sahaptians brought to The Dalles food products,
                  including meat, roots, and berries. At the trading places, the Wishram middlemen
                  exchanged those goods for dried salmon and European cloth and ironware. Distant
                  Sahaptians, especially the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> who had access to the plains, brought skin clothing, horses,
                  and buffalo meat. Less interested in fish than their Columbia cousins, the
                  Sahaptians of the plateau were drawn to The Dalles in search of European goods,
                  especially metal and beads.</p>
               <p> Centered at The Dalles and with one arm stretching east, the Pacific-Plateau
                  system also extended west down the Columbia to the coastal Chinookans. Those
                  Pacific peoples brought to the trade system a variety of European goods obtained
                  from fur traders, as well as indigenous crops. Among the manufactured objects
                  carried by them and eagerly sought by The Dalles merchants were guns, blankets,
                  clothing, and the prized blue beads. Coming upriver in their graceful canoes, the
                  lower Chinookans carried wappato roots to be pounded and made into a bread that
                  even the explorers found tasty. Once at The Dalles, Chinookans obtained dried
                  salmon, buffalo meat, and valuable bear grass used in making cooking baskets and
                  the distinctive Northwest Coast hats.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark observed and recorded much about the Pacific-Plateau network and
                  the kinds of goods that passed through it, but they arrived too late in the season
                  to witness the full flavor of a rendezvous at The Dalles. Although the smell of
                  dead fish still hung in the air and clouds of fleas hovered everywhere, the real
                  trading days were over by mid-October. The explorers grasped something of the
                  economic significance of The Dalles because they could see physical signs of the
                  trade. The Astorian Alexander Ross, who had extensive Columbia River experience
                  soon after Lewis and Clark, caught the personal side of that trading before it was
                  swept away by the great fur companies. Ross estimated that at peak trading times
                  three thousand Indians gathered at the Wishram villages for bargaining. But Ross
                  also understood that trading was more than a simple act of economic exchange. Here
                  Indians met old friends, made new ones, and heard the latest news. Gambling,
                  socializing, and sporting for the opposite sex were all essential features of the
                  trading days. "The Long Narrows," said Ross, "is the great emporium or mart of the
                  Columbia and the general theatre of gambling and roguery."<ref target="n0714" n="14"/>
               </p>
               <p> Escaping the analysis of Lewis and Clark and later whites was the political
                  significance of upper Chinookan control at The Dalles. In the Middle Missouri
                  system, it was essential for Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands to dominate both the flow of goods up the river and access
                  to crops produced by village farmers. Although Lewis and Clark consistently
                  misconstrued the nature of the relationship between nomads and villagers, they at
                  least sensed that trade and politics were closely joined along the Missouri. The
                  captains were much less aware of the balance of power down the Columbia. Upper
                  Chinookans such as the Skilloots did not have the military power possessed by the
                  Teton bands, but they were willing to resort to force in order to protect their
                  place as middlemen in the trade system. Just how far Indians from The Dalles to
                  the Cascades would go do defend their place in the network would be revealed in
                  1812 and 1814 when the fur traders Robert Stuart, Alexander Stuart, and James
                  Keith fought pitched battles with the river Indians for passage on the Columbia.
                  Lewis and Clark never drew such a violent response from the river peoples; it is
                  worth recalling that the only real trouble the expedition had while on the river
                  was with the Skilloots, a people very protective of their role as traders.<ref target="n0715" n="15"/>
               </p>
               <p> On October 22 the expedition came to Celilo Falls, the first physical barrier on
                  the Columbia. Long a major salmon-fishing place, the falls area was filled with
                  lodges and fish-drying scaffolds. It was plain from the flood of water over the
                  falls that a portage of the expedition's baggage had to be organized. That portage
                  required native help and soon the explorers enlisted a number of Teninos for that
                  duty. All the hurry to prepare for the portage, as well as the outlandish
                  appearance of the Americans, drew a large crowd of Indian onlookers. Ordway
                  pointedly wrote, "The natives are very troublesome about our camp." The trouble
                  Ordway had in mind was petty theft. Any object laid aside for a moment was bound
                  to vanish. Clark recognized the problem and claimed that when the expedition
                  established secure camps in the Celilo Falls-Dalles area the greatest concern was
                  not Indian arrows but "the protection of our stores from theft."<ref target="n0716" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p> The issue of theft, which reached peak proportions during the trip along the
                  Columbia between Celilo Falls and the Cascades, troubled the explorers as it would
                  later students of the expedition. Lewis and Clark found it a growing annoyance and
                  eventually a drain on their diminishing supply of trade goods. On the return
                  journey up the Columbia they openly threatened to fire on the thieves. In an
                  unusual outburst of anger and frustration, Lewis struck a Skilloot Indian caught
                  stealing during the return portage through The Dalles. At one point the captains
                  had to restrain some members of the expedition who seemed "well disposed to kill a
                  few of them."<ref target="n0717" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> What Lewis and Clark saw as troublesome and potentially dangerous behavior was
                  perceived by the river Indians rather differently. Taking axes, clothing, or
                  rifling through the expedition's luggage probably involved two patterns of
                  behavior not understood by the captains or their men. On one level, river people
                  saw the things they took from the expedition as proper payment for services
                  rendered. As the Indians viewed it, the explorers had more knives and blankets
                  than they could possibly use. What harm could there be in taking a blanket,
                  especially when the whites had so many and the Indians had provided valuable
                  support in portaging around dangerous places in the river? But the issue was more
                  complex. The river peoples had a strong sense of private property. They left
                  stacks of valuable dried fish standing unguarded without thought of loss. In
                  pilfering small objects from the Americans, they sought Lewis and Clarks'
                  acknowledgment of their importance. Taking an axe was done to remind the white men
                  of the need to offer respect and attention to the trading lords of the Columbia.
                  As a recent student of Wishram and Wasco life put it, "Thefts from whites would
                  arise not from fundamental lawlessness or from defining whites as enemies but
                  rather from a temporary dislocation of relations which might be remedied if
                  pressure were applied, for example, through thefts or incidents. These [pressures]
                  would serve to reestablish, not break, relationships."<ref target="n0718" n="18"/>
                  Theft as a means of creating mutually rewarding reciprocal relations was a notion
                  utterly foreign to the explorers. It made far more sense in their world to see
                  river people as crafty traders and cunning thieves.</p>
               <p> Throughout the day on October 23, members of the expedition struggled and sweated
                  as they manhandled goods and canoes over the Celilo Falls portage. That difficult
                  task was made even more unpleasant by swarms of fleas infesting the dried grass
                  and by fish skins littering the ground. Tortured by the fleas, many in the party
                  stripped off their skin shirts and breeches in an effort to rid themselves of the
                  biting pests. The portage lasted all day and eventually provided work for a few
                  Indians and entertainment for more who watched the whole undertaking with a
                  mixture of amusement and wonder.</p>
               <p> Near the end of the day, the strain of the portage effort was broken by an
                  alarming piece of news. One of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs appeared at the expedition's camp and with signs
                  claimed he had heard from Indians around the falls that "the nation below intended
                  to kill us." When the Sahaptians who had crowded around the Americans all during
                  the day left earlier than usual, Lewis and Clark thought the rumor was confirmed.
                  To prepare for the expected attack, they carefully checked weapons and issued each
                  man a sufficient number of rounds. With a bravado born of unfamiliar surroundings
                  and some real fear, Whitehouse boasted, "We were not afraid of them for we think
                  we can drive three times our number." The arms and ammunition may have reassured
                  men like Whitehouse, but the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs remained visibly worried throughout the night.<ref target="n0719" n="19"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Hidatsa threats against the expedition had some real
                  intention behind them, talk relayed thirdhand about the supposed plans of "the
                  nation below" appears in retrospect to be less reliable. The Indians referred to
                  as "the nation below" were certainly upper Chinookans, perhaps Wishrams or
                  Cascades. Those Indians and their neighbors did show considerable hostility toward
                  fur traders whose activities challenged The Dalles trade fair system. The rumor
                  reveals not so much the planned actions of the Chinookans around The Dalles as the
                  relations between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> and the Chinookans. Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky admitted to
                  the captains on October 24 that they feared for their lives if they remained with
                  the expedition once it passed The Dalles. During trading times the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> and Chinookans maintained the same sort of partnership as
                  did the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Assinniboine.xml"
                       rend="box">Assiniboins</ref>. But for most of the year there was considerably
                  more tension and occasional raiding between the two peoples. The alleged
                  preparations for an attack on Lewis and Clark may have been rumormongering or an
                  effort to justify the desire of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides to leave the party.<ref target="n0720" n="20"/>
               </p>
               <p> Whatever the cause of the alarm, the expedition's plans for combat did not go
                  unnoticed; as the Americans ventured through the dangerous Short and Long Narrows,
                  Indians approached them with much caution. Some Eneeshur Sahaptians who lived
                  around the Short Narrows watched in amazement as Lewis and Clark sent their canoes
                  and best watermen to shoot the Narrows. As this daring venture in whitewater
                  navigation was unfolding, Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky announced that they were
                  ready to leave the expedition. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> interpreters correctly reported that The Dalles was the
                  boundary between Sahaptian and Chinookan speakers. Lewis and Clark recognized that
                  the chiefs could do no interpreting past The Dalles, but because they hoped to
                  effect a peace treaty between the Sahaptians and the Chinookans, they persuaded
                  the chiefs to remain for two more days.</p>
               <p> Once safely past the Short Narrows and into Chinookan territory, the expedition
                  made camp near Nixluidix, the principal Wishram village. Attracted by the large
                  plank houses in the town, Clark paid the Wishrams a visit. He was welcomed warmly
                  and invited into one of the houses. Clark's journal entry for the day contains a
                  careful description of the house and details of its construction. But it remained
                  for the practical carpenter Patrick Gass to pronounce Nixluidix as a town filled
                  with "tolerably comfortable houses."</p>
               <p> Still bothered by flea bites and short of fuel for their fires, the explorers
                  settled in at their Dalles camp. Later that evening an Indian whom Lewis and Clark
                  vaguely described as "the principal chief from the nation below" presented himself
                  and several of his men at the American camp. It remains unclear who this chief was
                  and what group he represented. Whoever he was, the explorer-diplomats seized on
                  his arrival as an opportunity to promote one more of their intertribal peace
                  schemes. The expedition's records do not reveal the course of the negotiations,
                  but Lewis and Clark clamed they had engineered lasting peace and friendship
                  between the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> and the Chinookans. That claim had as much validity as did
                  earlier optimistic reports of a Missouri villager alliance against the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. In both cases, Lewis and Clark simply did not understand the
                  nature of tribal and band politics. But none of those unpleasant facts intruded on
                  pleasant illusions. Medals and gifts heightened the illusion of lasting peace, and
                  the evening slipped away to the sounds of dancing and of Pierre Cruzatte's
                     fiddle.<ref target="n0721" n="21"/>
               </p>
               <p> With the hazards of The Dalles behind them, Lewis and Clark continued their sweep
                  down the Columbia. Reassured by the friendly Nixluidix reception and by an
                  apparently successful piece of diplomacy, the explorers did not expect much Indian
                  trouble beyond the now-familiar incidents of theft. But just as the physical and
                  cultural landscape was persistently unsettling, so too did rumors of danger
                  persist. No sooner had the boats gotten through the Long Narrows than the Nez
                  Perce guides again began to talk about threats posed to the Americans by unnamed
                  "nations below." But when Lewis and Clark landed at a Wishram village past the
                  Long Narrows, they found no hostility but only a war chief and a number of
                  warriors on their way to attack Paiute bands. When the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs finally left the expedition, each was given a medal.
                  There was no sense of impending trouble as Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky went back
                     upriver.<ref target="n0722" n="22"/>
               </p>
               <p> Without <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides and among people whose language was unknown
                  to them, the Americans' safety now depended on the attitudes of the river people.
                  At the same time, much rested on the ability of the captains to restrain a growing
                  belligerence in the ranks directed against the Chinookans. From October 25 to the
                  first days of November, the explorers had almost daily contact with a large number
                  of Chinookans. Those encounters usually involved stopping at villages to purchase
                  dogs and dried fish to replenish the expedition's larder. Because these stops
                  never lasted long and communication was very difficult, pursuit of the usual
                  diplomatic and ethnographic goals proved nearly impossible. Nevertheless, the
                  explorers did manage to distribute medals and gifts to a number of village
                  leaders. Years later, during the complex Anglo-American negotiations surrounding
                  the Oregon Question, those actions of the expedition were used to bolster United
                  States claims to the Northwest. Despite language and time limitations, Clark's
                  journal entries contain an amazing amount of information about the river peoples
                  and their ways. Vivid descriptions of clothing, canoes, house construction, trade,
                  and burial practices can be found in expeditionary records for this period. Lewis
                  even found time to piece together laboriously several Chinookan vocabularies,
                  although how this was accomplished without interpreters remains unclear.
                  Throughout the last days of October and into November, relations between the
                  explorers and the Indians remained peaceful. Accustomed to the presence of
                  European goods and the indirect influence of white traders, most Chinookans were
                  not startled by the Americans. Many enjoyed the fiddle music and dancing. York
                  remained the attraction he had always been. The days contained the usual trials of
                  wilderness travel, but there was little expectation that the Indians on the
                  Columbia would add to the trials.</p>
               <p> Once the expedition passed The Dalles, travel was rapid and relations with the
                  river Chinookans were reasonably good. Although theft was an ever present
                  irritation, the expedition's need for food and information made the captains
                  unwilling to make good on the sorts of threats that would surface on the return
                  journey. For their part, the river Indians viewed Lewis and Clark as curiosities
                  and potential trading partners, certainly not as a possible challenge to native
                  domination in the region.</p>
               <p> But much of that apparent good will evaporated on November 4 when the expedition
                  encountered a large Skilloot village near the mouth of the Willamette River. The
                  Chinookan-speaking Skilloots occupied both sides of the Columbia between the
                  Washougal and Cowlitz rivers. Lewis and Clark met Skilloot traders all along the
                  river and on the return journey found a Skilloot settlement as far east as The
                  Dalles. During the early days of November, as the explorers entered Skilloot
                  territories—near present-day Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver,
                  Washington—they noted an ever increasing stock of European goods. That
                  supply of guns, swords, clothing, and assorted copper and brassware suggested the
                  economic role of the Skilloots. Ranging from the coast to The Dalles, they acted
                  as secondary middlemen along the western arm of the Pacific-Plateau system.<ref target="n0723" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p> Landing at a large Skilloot village of twenty-five houses, Lewis and Clark were
                  impressed by the many well-armed warriors as well as by the number of canoes drawn
                  up in front of the settlement. Invited into one of the lodges by a Skilloot who
                  had been hired earlier to pilot the expedition over this stretch of river, the
                  captains enjoyed roasted wappato roots and apparent good company. After purchasing
                  four bushels of wappato, Lewis and Clark's party moved several more miles
                  downriver, hoping to locate a suitable place for the noon meal. As the explorers
                  prepared their usual river diet of dried fish, dog meat, and roots, several canoes
                  of Skilloots appeared. Dressed in garb that was a colorful mixture of native dress
                  and European clothing, the Indians seemed bent on a festival or council. Anxious
                  to accommodate them, the captains promptly invited the Skilloots to join them. It
                  would be the last time Lewis and Clark ever allowed such a large number of heavily
                  armed Indians into camp. What the explorers expected would be a friendly meeting
                  soon turned unpleasant. For reasons that may have had something to do with a fear
                  of losing their economic position to unknown newcomers, the Skilloot warriors
                  became "assumeing and disagreeable." Adding injury to insult, one of the Skilloots
                  managed to steal Clark's prized ceremonial pipe tomahawk. As the captains searched
                  the Indians and their canoes, another Skilloot made off with a capote belonging to
                  either Charbonneau or Drouillard. All this confusion and trouble added up to a
                  thoroughly nasty afternoon. The expedition kept to the river for an hour after
                  dark "with a view to get clear of the natives who [were] constantly about us, and
                  troublesom." Now more than ever, the expedition looked upon the people of the
                  Columbia with a wary eye. As the explorers prepared to spend their last weeks on
                  the river, they were in no mood to accept Indians as anything other than necessary
                  trading partners.<ref target="n0724" n="24"/>
               </p>
               <p> For several days after the unhappy Skilloot encounter, the explorers kept up
                  their guard as they floated past Multnomah, Kathlamet, and Wahkiakum villages. As
                  with other river Chinookans, contacts with these villagers were brief and usually
                  for trade in food stores. Now and again there was time for some ethnographic
                  observations, as when Clark wrote an especially detailed description of Wahkiakum
                  houses. But what continued to occupy Lewis and Clark's attention was the sizable
                  number of European objects held by river people. In fact, European influence now
                  went beyond material goods and could be heard in the language. It is not clear
                  when Lewis and Clark first heard the Chinook trade jargon. English words and curse
                  phrases were noted among the Skilloots and their neighbors early in November. The
                  explorers also heard about the English trader, Mr. Haley. And it was on November 7
                  that William Clark wrote his memorable phrase "Ocian in view O! the joy." Although
                  the ocean proper was not quite yet in view, all attention was now focused on
                  reaching the coast and finding winter quarters as quickly as possible.<ref target="n0725" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> Information from the river Indians led Lewis and Clark to believe that there were
                  permanent trade establishments along the coast. Hoping to find traders and locate
                  a suitable place for wintering over, the captains attempted to quicken the pace of
                  travel. Thwarted by the rolling currents of the Columbia and the steadily
                  deteriorating weather, they found themselves stalled at Gray's Point in Gray's
                  Bay. From November 10 to November 15, the expedition camped on the east side of
                  Point Ellice. Those were miserable, wet days that dampened spirits and rotted
                  clothing already in tatters. Clark summed up the misery everyone felt when he
                  wrote, "We are all wet as usual—and our Situation is Truly a disagreeable
                  one; and our selves and party Scattered on floating logs and Such dry Spots as can
                  be found on the hill sides and crivicies of the rocks."<ref target="n0726" n="26"/> Borrowing from native practice, the explorers made hasty shelters from poles
                  and mat. Later those temporary lean-tos gave way to huts made from boards
                  scavenged from an abandoned Chinook village. Getting their first taste of a
                  coastal winter, the whole expedition may well have started to feel nostalgic for
                  the cold but bracing days on the northern plains.</p>
               <p> On November 15, after reconnoitering by John Colter and other members of the
                  expedition, the Americans moved down the coast four miles to a sandy beach just
                  below Chinook Point. Here, at an abandoned Chinook village, they spent the next
                  nine days until November 24. With the weather now clearing, they could see Point
                  Adams and Cape Disappointment. There in front of the weary explorers were the
                  rollers of the Pacific—the goal Clark had once described as "this great
                  Pacific Octean which we been so long anxious to see."<ref target="n0727" n="27"/>
                  The days spent at the Chinook Point camp were filled with visits from many
                  neighboring Chinooks and Clatsops. Although the explorers allowed only small
                  numbers of Indians into camp and treated all natives "with great distance," there
                  was a chance to meet Chinook chiefs like Comcomly and Chillarlawil. Besides trade
                  in fish, there were the more personal exchanges between the men in the expedition
                  and the young women offered by Delashelwilt's wife.</p>
               <p> The camp at Chinook Point provided a temporary respite from the demands of
                  constant travel. But the need to find a reliable food supply and a sheltered place
                  for winter quarters required the expedition to move once again. The Indians told
                  Lewis and Clark that lands along the south side of the river offered the best game
                  and roots. After taking a vote on November 24, the expedition moved back upriver
                  and crossed over to the south side of the Columbia. Early in December, following a
                  search by a small party under Lewis's command, the site for Fort Clatsop was
                  selected. Surrounded by marshes and towering fir trees, and invaded by a pervasive
                  dampness, the Lewis and Clark expedition prepared to spend a second winter in the
                  land of Jefferson's imagination.</p>
               <p> Indian visitors to the rain-soaked camps at Point Ellice and Chinook Point could
                  not have missed the tough talk and threats. The Chinooks, Kathlamets, and Clatsops
                  were repeatedly warned that any false moves would be met with maximum force by the
                  expedition. Sentries were ordered to fire on Indians suspected of theft if it
                  appeared that firearms were being taken. Clark claimed that all these threats and
                  verbal onslaughts produced the desired result. "We find the Indians easy ruled and
                  kept in order by stricter indifference towards them." Symbolic of all that
                  suspicion was the password "no Chinook" already in use by men of the expedition
                  even before the construction of Fort Clatsop.<ref target="n0728" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> The ill-concealed tensions between the expedition and coastal Indians was the
                  legacy of experiences and misunderstandings on the journey down the Columbia.
                  After the nasty encounter with the Skilloots, the explorers began to build a
                  negative image of river and coastal peoples that colored relations throughout the
                  winter. That powerful image was a composite of several related attitudes about
                  Pacific Northwest people and their lifeways. A principal element was the
                  perception of Chinookan peoples as incorrigible thieves. The theft of expedition
                  goods and the fear of losing weapons was behind much of the provocative language
                  directed at the Indians. Clark would have found substantial agreement in his ranks
                  when he branded the Chinookans as "thievishly inclined."<ref target="n0729" n="29"/>
               </p>
               <p> But it was more than a belief in their criminality that led the explorers to view
                  their Indian neighbors with suspicion and sometimes open hostility. During the
                  days at Point Ellice and Chinook Point, the expedition often depended on nearby
                  Indians for food. The Chinooks and Clatsops, accustomed to hard bargaining with
                  whites in the sea otter trade, expected to drive equally hard bargains with the
                  hungry explorers. Lewis and Clark clearly resented paying "immoderate prices" for
                  essential foodstuffs. When some Kathlamets came offering roots, skins, and woven
                  mats, "they asked such high prices that we were unable to purchase anything of
                     them."<ref target="n0730" n="30"/> What Indians saw as simply good business and
                  the Yankee law of supply and demand looked quite different to hungry and wet
                  Americans. The Chinookans, so it appeared to Lewis and Clark, were not only
                  thieves but sharp traders bent on gouging the needy. There was no trace of
                  admiration in Lewis's voice when he declared that the Clatsops were "great higlers
                  in trade and if they conceive you anxious to purchase [they] will be a whole day
                  bargaining for a handfull of roots." It did not take many days of fruitless
                  trading for green fish and roots in a pouring rain to convince the explorers that
                  coastal Indians were possessed of an "avarcious all grasping disposition."<ref target="n0731" n="31"/>
               </p>
               <p> To the image of thievish and grasping Indians Lewis and Clark added a third
                  element. They found many Chinookan customs and practices both incomprehensible and
                  reprehensible. Although the expedition always viewed Indian life through the
                  filter of its own Euro-American values, there were native ways, especially on the
                  northern plains, that the explorers found praiseworthy. No such praise was offered
                  to coastal peoples. Lewis and Clark repeatedly described the Chinookans as dirty,
                  poorly clad people who engaged in such barbarous customs as head flattening and
                  ankle binding. Coastal sexual practices also came in for much pointed comment.
                  During the Fort Mandan winter, sexual relations between village women and men in
                  the expedition had been commonplace. Although concerned about the spread of
                  veneral complaints in the ranks, the captains had been muted in their criticism of
                  those Indian women. There was no such reluctance to vilify the coastal women. From
                  the time of the first sexual encounters with Chinook women in November, Lewis and
                  Clark blasted them as promiscuous sellers of their own bodies for trinkets and
                  bits of ribbon.<ref target="n0732" n="32"/>
               </p>
               <p> Finally, and perhaps most important, there was the matter of the physical
                  appearance of coastal Indians. Every culture promotes its own image of an
                  attractive body. The Indians of the northern plains came quite close to the
                  somatic norm held by the explorers. But the Indians Lewis and Clark found on the
                  lower Columbia and on the coast did not fit the Euro-American image. Shorter in
                  stature and possessing facial features quite unlike those of the plains natives,
                  the Chinookans appeared to the explorers as "low and ill-shaped." The fact that
                  these Indians were superb canoe navigators, masterful traders, and skillful
                  fishermen was often overlooked as the expedition stressed what it saw as the
                  negative aspects of a "badly clad and illy made" people.<ref target="n0733" n="33"/>
               </p>
               <p> In many ways, reaching the Great Western Sea was an anticlimax. Certainly all
                  members of the expedition were exhilarated by the sight of the ocean. There was a
                  sense of achievement in knowing that they had passed the tests of a hazardous
                  land. Clark's own enthusiasm emerged when, taking a cue from Alexander Mackenzie,
                  he carved on a big pine tree: "William Clark December 3rd 1805. By land from the
                  U. States in 1804 &amp; 1805." As Clark recalled, his men appeared" much Satisfied
                  with their trip beholding with estonishment the high waves dashing against the
                  rocks &amp; this emence Ocian."<ref target="n0734" n="34"/> But those feelings of
                  excitement and accomplishment were tempered by relations with new neighbors that
                  were already less than cordial. Throughout November, as the explorers suffered in
                  the rain and cold, they were increasingly willing to use threats against the
                  Chinookans. Given their experiences with other river bands and the constant
                  problem of theft, Lewis and Clark surely felt justified in telling the Indians
                  that they would be summarily shot if caught stealing guns or other weapons. Short
                  on provisions and confronted by native traders who demanded high prices for their
                  goods, the explorers felt trapped. Resorting to threats satisfied their desire to
                  be in control of a difficult situation, but it spread fear and suspicion among the
                  very people the Americans needed as winter allies and friends. Hemmed in by an
                  inhospitable climate, an uncertain and monotonous food supply, and a language
                  foreign to all expedition ears, Lewis and Clark faced a winter whose hazards were
                  no less real than they had been at Fort Mandan. Whether their Indian neighbors
                  would exacerbate those dangers was still unknown.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> As the Corps of Discovery settled into winter quarters along the Netul (Lewis and
                  Clark) River, William Clark described the site of Fort Clatsop as "the most
                  eligable Situation for our purposes of any in its neighbourhood."<ref target="n0801" n="1"/> But neither Clark nor his fellow explorers seemed quite
                  able to fix those purposes clearly in mind. It was as if once reaching the Pacific
                  the expedition lost a sense of direction and purpose. The reasons for raising Fort
                  Clatsop seemed less compelling than those that had brought Fort Mandan to life. On
                  the coast the expedition needed time to prepare itself for a demanding return
                  across the continent. The store of notes and maps from the outbound journey had to
                  be consolidated. In the spruce and fir forests and marshlands around the fort,
                  plants and animals new to eastern eyes required observation, description, and
                  cataloging. To continue their ethnography, the explorers would have to question
                  Indians and court their chiefs. And, as always, they looked at the land and its
                  peoples with the needs of an expanding American trade empire in mind. From natural
                  history and economic geography to salt boiling and moccasin making—these
                  seemed to qualify as "our purposes." But none of these could spark the excitement
                  and anticipation that had run through life a winter before at Fort Mandan. In the
                  predictable procession of wind, storm, and fog, the months ahead loomed as an
                  endless round of rain-soaked days. A season at Fort Clatsop seemed to promise
                  mildew, spoiled meat, and numbing boredom.</p>
               <p> Clark's "eligable Situation" would have pleased any Chinookan band seeking a
                  winter village site. They might have quickly appreciated the advantages provided
                  by the river and surrounding forests and wetlands. But what any native of the
                  lower Columbia knew to be a bountiful country was soon perceived by Lewis and
                  Clark as a damp prison stocked with meager fare. That there could be two such
                  divergent ways of evaluating the Pacific Northwest is fundamental in understanding
                  expedition-Indian relatins during the winter at Fort Clatsop. Americans and
                  Chinookans saw themselves, each other, and the physical environment in profoundly
                  different ways.</p>
               <p> Symbolic of those differences was the expedition's obvious disgust with coastal
                  weather. A powerful entry in Clark's journal for December 16, 1805, captured a
                  sense of awe and fear. "The rain continues, with Tremendious gusts of wind, which
                  is Tremendious. The winds violent    Trees falling in every direction,
                  whorl winds, with gusts of rain    Hail &amp; Thunder, This kind of
                  weather lasted all day, Certainly one of the worst days that ever was!" Less
                  memorable but perhaps more typical were the string of phrases "we are all wet and
                  disagreeable," "cold and a dreadful day," and most common of all, "the rain
                  continued as usual"<ref target="n0802" n="2"/> While explorers huddled in their
                  dank quarters and cursed the foul weather, the Indians went about their daily
                  routine knowing that wind, rain, and thunder were but spirit forces making their
                  powers known for all to see. Paddling canoes that defied the worst waves and
                  wearing hats and capes admirably suited to wet days, the Chinookans may have
                  paused to wonder why the bearded men in the log lodge feared the weather and hid
                  from it.</p>
               <p> Those Indians perplexed by the strange behavior of their neighbors on the Netul
                  had not lacked contact with other whites or their fascinating metals and textiles.
                  A decade before Lewis and Clark wintered at Fort Clatsop, Europeans had come to
                  the Columbia with stocks of tea kettles, copper sheets, and blue beads. By 1805
                  the annual spring visits of British and American ships to a rendezvous on the
                  waters of Bakers Bay had become an eagerly anticipated event in the lower
                  Chinookans' year. European-manufactured objects quickly pervaded native life.
                  Guns, brass bracelets, and iron pots took an honored place among the goods in
                  burial vaults up the Columbia and along the coast. As if to emphasize that outside
                  contact, the Chinook trade jargon was amply filled with salty English words and
                  phrases.</p>
               <p> The contacts lower Chinookans had with whites before Lewis and Clark determined a
                  substantial part of their reaction to the expedition. Those experiences had their
                  recorded beginnings in 1792 when three distinct parties crossed the treacherous
                  bar of the Columbia and entered the world of the Chinooks and their neighbors. In
                  May of that year, Captain Robert Gray and his ship <hi rend="italic">Columbia
                     Rediviva</hi> sailed upriver on a merchant excursion that lasted until the end
                  of the month. Gray, who had already made a journey to the coast, was intent on
                  capturing some of the sea otter trade that had drawn so many ships farther north.
                  The American captain found the Chinooks anxious to exchange skins for a wide
                  variety of hardware and cloth. In the fall of the same year, the river had its
                  second caller. The Royal Navy ship <hi rend="italic">Chatham,</hi> under the
                  command of Lt. W. R. Broughton and part of the Vancouver expedition, explored far
                  up the Columbia. Broughton's purpose was not overtly commercial, but he did note
                  the interest of river people in manufactured goods, an observation not lost on
                  English maritime investors. The last visitor in that busy year was the British
                  trader Captain James Baker in the ship <hi rend="italic">Jenny.</hi> Baker pursued
                  a brisk trade with the Chinooks at the bay named for him. The ships on the
                  Columbia in 1792 were just the beginning of a whole fleet yet to come.<ref target="n0803" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p> By the mid-1790s, traders were making the lower reaches of the Columbia a regular
                  stop on the sea otter network that now stretched from Boston and Bristol to Nootka
                  Sound and on to China. Captains like those the Indians later listed for Lewis and
                  Clark were attracted not only by sea otters and beavers but by arrowproof
                  moosehide armor called clamons. These "leather war dresses" were then exchanged
                  for pelts with the warriors of what is now British Columbia. Typical of those
                  trading ventures and the relations between merchants and Indians was the voyage of
                  the Bristol ship <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> and her captain Charles Bishop. Late
                  in May 1795, the <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> braved the vicious currents of the
                  Columbia bar to anchor at Bakers Bay. Already familiar with the trading routine,
                  scores of Chinooks paddled out to the ship and asked Bishop to fire a gun
                  announcing the start of business. If Bishop believed that his fine store of
                  merchandise would tempt Chinooks to hand over quickly valuable skins and clamons,
                  he was quite mistaken. The Indians had already learned about supply and demand.
                  They had become, in Lewis's colorful phrase, "great higlers in trade."<ref target="n0804" n="4"/> Even if Bishop's array of kettles, brass rods, and
                  brightly colored cloth tempted them, the Chinooks knew the value of tantalizing
                  delay. "In the Evening," recalled the British skipper, "the whole of them took to
                  their cannoes and paddled to shore, leaving us not more disappointed than
                  surprized." Thinking they had made their point, the Chinooks returned the next day
                  and began to set prices. But Bishop was equally willing to play the waiting game,
                  and it was not until the following day that he "broke trade with the Natives." By
                  June 5 the <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> had on board more than one hundred sea
                  otter pelts of fine quality. If the captain ws pleased, so were the Indians. The
                  rituals of trade had been properly observed and both peoples had increased
                  personal wealth, a cherished goal that united traders on both sides of the
                  cultural divide.<ref target="n0805" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p> Out of the sorts of encounters with ships like the <hi rend="italic">Ruby,</hi>
                  the Chinookans developed a set of expectations about Europeans. The whites were a
                  trading people who came from the sea in large canoes to exchange valuable metal
                  and cloth for skins. Traders could be violent, but their touchy tempers might be
                  softened by having women do much of the bargaining for both goods and services.
                  The Chinookans were convinced, at least by 1805, that whites would eventually pay
                  any price for sea otter pelts. Trading became a ritual game enjoyed as much for
                  sport as for material reward. But material rewards were never far from the center
                  of all native coastal cultures, and when Lewis and Clark refused to play the
                  trading game there was some confusion and considerable misunderstanding. The
                  whites were traders from the sea, hungry for skins and occasional sex. That a
                  party of them might come overland bringing neither large supplies of goods nor a
                  passion for pelts gave Indians pause to wonder what manner of <hi rend="italic">pâh-shish'-e-ooks</hi> or "cloth men" these were.</p>
               <p> Maritime traders like Robert Gray and Charles Bishop saw only a small segment of
                  the Indian village world. At Fort Mandan, Lewis and Clark had been quite close to
                  their Indian hosts. Such was not the case during the 1805–1806 winter. The
                  decision to establish Fort Clatsop two miles up the Netul River meant that the
                  expedition was at some distance from any substantial Indian settlements. Situated
                  northwest from the fort across the Columbia around Bakers Bay were several
                  villages occupied by the Chinooks-proper. At the time of Lewis and Clark, the most
                  important Chinook village was Qwatsa'mts, at the mouth of the Chinook River on
                  Bakers Bay. This plank-house settlement was home to the powerful chief Comcomly.
                  Although the explorers gave no village-by-village population figures for the
                  Chinooks-proper, they did estimate the total number of houses at twenty-eight and
                  the population at some four hundred.</p>
               <p> Still on the north shore and northeast from Fort Clatsop were the two villages of
                  people Lewis and Clark called "Wackiakums." As was so often the case, the
                  explorers had a difficult time separating the names of villages, bands, tribes,
                  and linguistic divisions. The Wahkiakums lived in two villages at the mouth of
                  Elochoman River. The larger one, containing seven houses, was called
                  Wa'qaiya·qam; the smaller, only four houses, was called Lo'xumin. The
                  Wahkiakums were part of the Chinookan dialect division known as Kathlamet, but
                  were not part of the political world of those Cathlamet villagers who lived on the
                  south side of the great river—a fact that proved especially confusing for
                  Lewis and Clark. Kala amat or Cathlamet was the native name for a town of nine
                  large plank houses located on the south side of the Columbia about four miles
                  below Puget Island. The Cathlamets remained at this site until about 1810, when
                  they moved across the river and joined the Wahkiakums at Wa'qaiya·qam.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's closest neighbors were the Clatsop Indians. The explorers knew
                  and mapped three of their villages. Nearest to the fort was Lä't'cap, a name
                  that meant "dried salmon" and provided Europeans with the name Clatsop. The "dried
                  salmon" village was about seven miles southwest from Fort Clatsop. Situated on a
                  branch of the Skipanon River near the ocean, the village had three houses with
                  twelve families. To this village William Clark traveled in December and met
                  Cuscalar, a prominent headman. It may also have been home to the Clatsop headman
                  Coboway. North from "Dried Salmon" on Point Adams was the largest Clatsop
                  settlement known to the expedition. Neahkeluk had eight large wooden houses; later
                  in the nineteenth century, it would be palisaded for protection against hostile
                  attack. For reasons that are now unclear, Lewis and Clark never visited this
                  village nor had any recorded contact with its leaders. Farther down the coastal
                  plain at the mouth of the Necanicum River was a cluster of seven houses. Three of
                  those were occupied by the Clatsops; the remainder of the Tillamooks. So at least
                  fourteen houses in the area contained some two hundred Clatsops.</p>
               <p> The most distant of Lewis and Clark's neighbors were the Tillamooks. Their
                  villages along the coast began at the Necanicum, with most centered around
                  Tillamook Bay. Because the Tillamooks spoke the Chinook jargon to strangers, the
                  explorers did not realize that these Indians were not Chinookan speakers but
                  belonged to the Salish language family. Early in the winter, Lewis and Clark
                  believed that villages like Necost, Natti, and those around Tillamook Bay
                  represented distinct nations. Only gradually did this confusion clear. It was to
                  the village of Necost, at the mouth of Elk Creek, that Clark traveled on his way
                  to see a beached whale. In their "estimate of Western Indians," the explorers
                  recorded that there were fifty Tillamook houses with a population totaling one
                     thousand.<ref target="n0806" n="6"/>

            <div type="section">
               <p> In a disconcerting way, the winter at Fort Clatsop has no narrative history. The
                  winter at Fort Mandan had been a dramatic series of alarms and confusions
                  punctuated by buffalo hunts, holiday celebrations, and occasional personal
                  escapades. At Fort Clatsop the major events were Clark's trip to see a beached
                  whale, Hugh McNeal's brush with death at the hands of a dangerous Tillamook, and
                  the ill-advised decision to steal a Clatsop canoe. None of these can compare with
                  the dangers of threatened <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> attacks or the tensions of a diplomatic mission to a hostile
                  Hidatsa town. At Fort Clatsop, there were only the elemental tasks of hunting,
                  cooking, and mending. Even these had a timeless quality about them as they were
                  repeated day after day. It was more than dampness and slow rot that pervaded life
                  on the coast. Boredom was rife, to be fought off by every means available. Journal
                  entries took on an almost copybook quality, while busy fingers turned out more
                  moccasins than would ever be needed for the return journey. Lewis captured that
                  sense of time in suspension when he wrote, "Every thing moves on in the old
                     way."<ref target="n0807" n="7"/> Because Indian relations at Fort Clatsop do
                  not follow a chronological pattern, this chapter uses topical categories such as
                  visiting, trading, diplomacy, and ethnography to suggest the ways explorers and
                  Indians dealt with each other.</p>
               <p> The Lewis and Clark expedition was one of the greatest tourist attractions the
                  native West had ever seen. Generally, crowds of Indians were attracted by the
                  strangers and their fascinating array of weapons, clothing, and camp gear. Almost
                  everywhere, visiting the explorers became a source of endless diversion and
                  interesting conversation. Each visit had an element of personal discovery as both
                  Indians and explorers eyed each other and then perhaps shared food or trade. At
                  Fort Mandan there had been scarcely a day without a visit by Indians bent on
                  seeing just what went on behind those log walls. Lewis and Clark encouraged
                  visiting, knowing that it brought rewards in food, information, and security.
                  During the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, visiting was a two-way affair. Members of the expedition
                  regularly paid calls at the earth-lodge villages. On New Year's Day, 1805, the
                  explorers made especially festive trips to their Indian neighbors. Music, dancing,
                  and hearty food marked that holiday fling. Although it would be too much to claim
                  that the Missouri River villagers and the explorers made lasting friendships, the
                  rituals of visiting in lodge and fort softened the rigors of a plains winter.</p>
               <p> That kind of visiting, so characteristic of an earlier season, did not occur at
                  Fort Clatsop. For all sorts of reasons, the Chinookans and the Americans did not
                  share much of each other's company. When Indians came to the fort it was for
                  business, not for companionship or curiosity. When Fort Mandan had been under
                  construction, dozens of Indians had watched at every stage of the building. At
                  Fort Clatsop there were far fewer riverbank superintendents. Early in December,
                  four Indians appeared at the fort site and spent the better part of the day
                  staring at the explorers. Later in the month, as work moved slowly on the huts,
                  two other Indians came to observe the project. Social visits were so unusual that
                  when one did happen it was sure to be noted in the expedition's journals. One of
                  those rare calls took place on January 20, when three Clatsops came to the fort
                  and spent the day. As if to underscore how remarkable this was, Clark wrote, "The
                  object of their visit is mearly to smoke the pipe."<ref target="n0808" n="8"/>
               </p>
               <p> If only a handful of Chinookans bothered to pay friendly visits at Fort Clatsop,
                  there were even fewer white guests in plank houses. Clark's journey to the "Dried
                  Salmon" village on December 9 and 10 and his later trip to the Tillamooks were not
                  so much social calls as reconnaissance probes for a good salt-boiling site or a
                  supply of whale blubber. Members of the expedition did not visit their neighbors.
                  Perhaps blocked by the strong currents in the Columbia estuary, no explorer
                  ventured to the Chinook villages at Bakers Bay. Even more surprising, there is no
                  record of anyone in the expedition visiting the largest Clatsop village,
                  Neahkeluk, located on Point Adams. Not even the usual holiday spirit moved men
                  like Pierre Cruzatte to take his fiddle outside Fort Clatsop's gates. New Year's
                  Day, always a time in the French and English traditions to visit neighbors, did
                  not see any noisy greetings shared with Clatsop villagers. The only members of the
                  expedition who may have visited in Indian homes were those who, like Joseph Field,
                  William Bratton, and Geroge Gibson, spent many days at the salt-boiling camp. At
                  that site there were seven Indian houses, and it is possible that the men found
                  them better shelter than their tents.</p>
               <p> It was not from a lack of conviviality that Indians paid so few social calls at
                  Fort Clatsop. When Clark first entered a Clatsop village he was treated with
                  "extrodeanary friendship." His host, a man named Cuscalar, had new mats placed on
                  the floor and presented the captain with platters of food. Lewis and Clark readily
                  admitted that their neighbors could be "very loquacious and inquisitive."<ref target="n0809" n="9"/> But the social distance between them could not be
                  overcome. Part of the explanation rests with the increasing commercialization of
                  coastal life. Trade and the acquisition of material wealth had always been an
                  important part of Chinookan life. With the coming of white merchants and the
                  influx of manufactured goods, that facet became even more prominant. Contacts with
                  whites were commercial, not social. The Indians found nothing at Fort Clatsop that
                  was especially strange or interesting. Lewis's airgun might have drawn an extra
                  look and Drouillard's marksmanship was impressive, but coastal people were already
                  familiar with firearms, even if they did not own many. York was no attraction.
                  Since American ships out of New England often brought black sailors, a man like
                  York was not going to draw the kind of attention paid on the Upper Missouri. Few
                  trade goods, language problems, and an isolated location served to make Fort
                  Clatsop a place remote from the centers of Indian activity.</p>
               <p> Perhaps the central reason for the lack of sociability during the second winter
                  rested with the expedition's Indian policy. As noted above, Lewis and Clark
                  distrusted and disliked the peoples of the region. The explorers viewed them as
                  habitual thives tainted with avarice and treachery. A long series of incidents and
                  misunderstandings beginning with the expedition's descent of the Columbia seemed
                  to justify such suspicion and ill-concealed hostility. The explorers might well
                  have asked how one could find friends among badly clad, ill-shaped people who
                  squatted like frogs and tied the ankles of their young women. They did not want
                  such Indians as part of the expedition's daily life.</p>
               <p> The captains' desire to keep the Indians at bay was made plain in special orders
                  written at Fort Clatsop. Issued on January 1, 1806, they established strict
                  procedures for dealing with Indians who came to the fort. Sentries were instructed
                  to watch carefully for "the designs or approach of the savages." Once an Indian
                  was seen coming toward the fort, sentries were required to inform the sergeant of
                  the guard, who in turn was to notify either captain. The specific orders for the
                  treatment of those Indians permitted inside the fort are important enough to be
                  quoted in full. <quote> The Commanding Officers require and charge the Garrison to
                     treat the natives in a friendly manner; nor will they be permitted at any time,
                     to abuse, assault or strike them; unless such abuse assault or stroke be first
                     given by the natives. Nevertheless it shall be right for any individual, in a
                     peaceable manner, to refuse admittance to, or put out of his room, any native
                     who may become troublesome to him; and should such native refuse to go when
                     requested, or attempt to enter their rooms after being forbidden to do so; it
                     shall be the duty of the sergeant of the guard on information of the same, to
                     put such native out of the fort and see that he is not again admitted during
                     the day unless specially permitted; and the Sergeant of the guard may for this
                     purpose imploy such coercive measures (not extending to the taking of life) as
                     shall at his discretion be deemed necessary to effect the same. </quote> One
                  further section of the regulation calls for some attention. At Fort Mandan,
                  staying overnight had been an honor freely extended to many Indians. At Fort
                  Clatsop, the sergeant of the guard, accompanied by Charbonneau and two armed
                  sentries, was required to "collect and put out of the fort, all Indians except
                  such as may be permitted to remain by the Commanding Officers."<ref target="n0810" n="10"/> Only rarely was that permission granted and even visiting chiefs found
                  themselves unceremoniously ejected from the compound at sunset. Such restrictions
                  on hospitality were not lost on the Indians. Accustomed to considerable freedom in
                  dealing with white traders, they could only resent the suspicion directed toward
                  them from the fort on the Netul.</p>
               <p> Although the restrictions on hospitality at Fort Clatsop and the natives'
                  economic expectations of whites limited the number of social visits, there were
                  nonetheless fairly regular meetings between the explorers and the Indians. Trading
                  for objects made by native skill or gathered from the land or sea had always been
                  a point of contact between Indians and Europeans. Even though both parties
                  sometimes believed they were being shortchanged, the lure of furs and iron pots
                  kept them coming back for more.</p>
               <p> At Fort Mandan the corn trade had been essential for the expedition's survival.
                  Establishing the war-axe forge had been a measure of how far Lewis and Clark were
                  willing to stretch their diplomacy to ensure a reliable food supply. But at Fort
                  Clatsop there was a conscious effort to achieve self-sufficiency. The south side
                  of the Columbia was chosen as a wintering site because it was reported to have a
                  plentiful game supply. Led by George Drouillard, hunters in the expedition were
                  expected to provide staples for the winter diet. But the scarcity of game, its
                  often poor quality, and the difficulty in preserving meat in a warm, damp climate
                  made self-sufficiency an impossible goal. It was plain that the expedition's
                  larders would be bare or at least its diet monotonous unless an Indian food trade
                  was established.</p>
               <p> As their closest neighbors, the Clatsops were most often the expedition's trading
                  partners. Coboway's people soon realized that Lewis and Clark were not ordinary
                  traders in search of fur. Quickly readjusting their own marketing strategies, the
                  Indians were ready to provide produce, not pelts. Beginning in early December
                  1805, Indian canoes came up the Netul loaded with a wide variety of foodstuffs.
                  Believing that the explorers' tastes were much like their own, native merchants
                  brought quantities of wappato, fish, salal berry cakes, shannetahque (cured edible
                  thistle root), and culhomo (seashore lupine root). Those same canoes also held
                  stacks of hats, bags, mats, and an occasional dog. Sea otter and elk skins were
                  usually offered for sale by traders not familiar with the market conditions.
                  Shrewd dealers as they were, the Clatsops quickly grasped the expedition's needs
                  and increasingly offered what would sell.</p>
               <p> The Fort Clatsop market was never as busy or as noisy as the corn exchange at
                  Fort Mandan. During the nearly four months the explorers lived on the coast,
                  Indians came to trade on only twenty-four days. The fort was never a major market
                  stop, something a party of Wahkiakums made plain when they refused to sell all
                  their wappato there, preferring to vend it at the Clatsops for whale blubber.<ref target="n0811" n="11"/> If native sellers tried to cater to Fort Clatsop needs
                  without abandoning traditional trade patterns, white buyers were equally selective
                  in what they purchased. Prices too high or quality too low were sure grounds for
                  no sale. On well over half of the trading days, goods offered by Indians were
                  rejected or a partial purchase was made. Selective buying meant that Lewis and
                  Clark obtained foodstuffs that were reasonably priced and of good quality while
                  rejecting higher-priced items. In all this there must have been a great deal of
                  haggling conducted by signs and an occasional phrase in the trade jargon.</p>
               <p> It did not take Lewis and Clark long to learn that "those people ask generally
                  double and tribble the value of what they have to sell, and never take less than
                  the real value of the article in such things as is calculated to do them service."
                  At that rate, the expedition's stock of merchandise was bound to diminish with
                  alarming speed. Once lavish in their gifts to Indians along the Missouri, the
                  explorers were reduced to a very short supply of trade goods. Gone were the calico
                  shirts, brass combs, and "small cheap looking glasses" that so charmed the Indians
                  up the big river and across the Great Divide. What remained was a motley
                  collection of fishhooks, brass wire and armbands, moccasin awls, worn files, and
                  beads of various colors. By early January 1806, Lewis complained, "Our merchandize
                  is reduced to a mear handfull." Despite an inventory that could fit into two
                  handkerchiefs, trade continued. Throughout the dismal winter months, the
                  expedition purchased roots, berries, and fish. The rain-shedding qualities of
                  Chinookan hats so impressed Lewis and Clark that they had some made especially to
                  their own head measurements. Unfortunately, the journals are silent on the price
                  paid to Indian women for such custom-fitted articles. Wappato continued a major
                  item, so important that Coboway made at least one special trip upriver just to
                  locate a fresh supply of the roots.<ref target="n0812" n="12"/>
               </p>
               <p> Even with the limited number of trade contacts, there were problems. Those
                  difficulties were not so much disagreements about price or quality as
                  misunderstandings over trading protocol and etiquette. Each partner had rules and
                  believed they should be obeyed, even if his opposite number neither understood nor
                  agreed to those rules. Lewis and Clark expected the Indians to follow the new
                  orders about leaving the fort at sunset. Four Wahkiakums who had been trying to
                  sell roots at rather high prices proved "very forward" and left the fort "with
                  relictiance" when confronted with the new orders.<ref target="n0813" n="13"/>
                  Perhaps the most memorable case of trade involved the Clatsop Cuscalar and his
                  family. It was Cuscalar who welcomed Clark to "Dried Salmon" village in December
                  1805, and the two men soon struck up something of a friendship. When the Indian
                  was sick, Clark thoughtfully sent a piece of cinnamon to cheer him. On the day
                  before Christmas 1805, Cuscalar, his younger brother, and two women appeared at
                  the fort. Seated on the ground before the captains, the Indian ceremoniously laid
                  out a supply of mats and roots. Whether this was a gift or goods offered for trade
                  is not clear now and may not have been so to the explorers. Later in the evening
                  Cuscalar asked for several metal files. If the mats and roots were gifts, then the
                  Indian had every reason to think that a reciprocal present would be offered.
                  Plainly confused by what was going on, Lewis and Clark announced that no files
                  were available and abruptly returned Cuscalar's goods. Undaunted, the Indian then
                  offered the captains the services of the two women in his party. When this gesture
                  was rebuffed, Cuscalar was displeased and the women "highly disgusted."<ref target="n0814" n="14"/>
               </p>
               <p> Whether or not sales were made, and cultural confusions aside, trading did
                  provide the Indians and the explorers a small space of common ground in an
                  otherwise suspicious atmosphere. The cultures of both groups shared many economic
                  values and practices. Each placed great emphasis on acquiring material wealth and
                  measured personal status by that wealth. Individuals who excelled as traders were
                  praised for their skill and rewarded for their enterprise. Yankee capitalists, no
                  less than Chinookans, expected every business contact to have an almost balletlike
                  quality in which both buyer and seller spent hours dancing around each other
                  offering price and counterprice. Lewis learned that lesson when he spent a full
                  day dickering with an Indian over the relative values of a watch and some sea
                  otter pelts, only to have the whole transaction come to naught. Like the New
                  England shopkeeper or the backcountry merchant, the Chinookan trader knew when to
                  hold his ground and when to sell quickly. Sea otter pelts that cost fathoms of
                  blue beads one day might go the next for half a twist of tobacco or some castoff
                  clothing. Had circumstances been different and the traders his own cultural kin,
                  Lewis might have meant as praise his description of Indian merchants as "close
                  dealers" who would "Stickle for a very little, never close a bargin except they
                  think they have the advantage."<ref target="n0815" n="15"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although Clark called Fort Clatsop "the most eligable Situation for our
                  purposes," no expeditionary assignment proved harder to define or more elusive to
                  execute than diplomatic relations with the coastal peoples. When the Corps of
                  Discovery struggled up the Missouri and wintered at Fort Mandan its diplomatic
                  agenda was very plain. It included proclaiming United States sovereignty,
                  establishing legal relations with native peoples, and surveying the northern and
                  western boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase. Equally important was extending the
                  St. Louis-based American trade empire, something essential in Jefferson's vision
                  of a West more commercial than colonial. The tactics Lewis and Clark employed in
                  pursuing those goals ranged from confronting Canadian traders and meeting with
                  native leaders to forming, ever so slowly, an alliance of villagers against
                  pro-British nomads. Flags, medals, presents, client chiefs, and full-dress
                  parades—all this Lewis and Clark inherited from a long tradition of
                  Indian-white diplomacy that stretched back to eastern forests.</p>
               <p> But what seemed so clear on the Missouri and within the bounds of the newly
                  purchased lands became less plain on the other side of the mountains. Despite
                  Robert Gray's effective discovery of the Columbia River in 1792, the infant
                  American Republic had neither the power to proclaim sovereignty in the Northwest
                  nor was this Jefferson's immediate intention. The president did explain to Lewis
                  in 1803 his desire to shift control of the Pacific fur trade out of British hands
                  at Nootka Sound to an America post near the headwaters of the Missouri.<ref target="n0816" n="16"/> On the Missouri, American efforts aimed at diminishing
                  British influence involved complex attempts to rearrange Indian-trader alliances
                  and recast tribal politics. Promoting peace among tribes, offering weapons and
                  American military protection, promising to bring vast stores of trade
                  goods—all were diplomatic strategies toward that end. But down the Columbia,
                  American interests were less clear. Thinking that their Missouri River diplomacy
                  had succeeded, Lewis and Clark may have attempted to create similar economic
                  alliances on the coast. The effort to patch up quarrels between Sahaptian and
                  Chinookan speakers at The Dalles suggests such diplomacy had not been entirely
                  abandoned. But at Fort Clatsop, Lewis and Clark found no open tensions to resolve,
                  nor were they certain of their own authority. And, of course, if most Indians did
                  not think the writ of the young Republic ran even as far as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>, it surely could not cross the mountains to touch the lives of
                  the Chinooks and the Clatsops.</p>
               <p> What passed for diplomacy during the winter among the Clatsops began even before
                  the expedition settled along the Netul. Contacts with the Chinooks-proper started
                  in mid-November 1805 on something less than a friendly note. Angered by an attempt
                  to steal guns from the expedition, Clark bluntly informed the Indians that anyone
                  seen near the baggage would be shot. Two days later, on November 17, a man
                  identified only as "the principal chief of the Chinnooks" appeared at the American
                  camp. Since neither the Chinooks nor any of their neighbors were tribes with
                  unified political leadership but were autonomous villages, this man could have
                  been any one of several headmen. The expedition's records are equally unhelpful in
                  revealing what took place between the captains and their visitor except that the
                  explorers now knew the Chinooks to be "noumerous" and "well armed with
                     fusees."<ref target="n0817" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> It was not until later in November, with the expedition still camped on the north
                  side of the Columbia, that any recorded diplomatic exchanges with the Chinooks
                  took place. On November 20, as Clark and his party returned from their Cape
                  Disappointment reconnaissance, they found the Chinook chiefs Comcomly and
                  Chillarlarwil with Lewis. There are no journal entries by Lewis for this period,
                  so what passed between the explorer and the chiefs is not known. Clark reported
                  only that the two Indians were given medals and one was additionally favored with
                  a flag. Lewis and Clark usually linked such objects to accepting American
                  sovereignty and the essentials of federal Indian policy. But neither at this
                  meeting nor at any other during the winter did the explorers make any promises or
                  require the Indians to submit to American control. Hindered by language problems
                  and mutual wariness, diplomacy with the Chinooks proceeded at a glacial pace.<ref target="n0818" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p> Despite the fact that the Chinooks were the largest, best-armed, and most
                  influential native group at the mouth of the Columbia, Lewis and Clark made no
                  effort to build on their initial talks. They did not venture across the Columbia
                  to visit Chinook villages, nor did they invite chiefs like Comcomly, Chillarlawil,
                  or Taucum to council at Fort Clatsop. For explorer-diplomats who had been
                  instructed to redirect the fur trade toward American posts, this was a strangely
                  passive way to go about it.</p>
               <p> Throughout the long winter on the coast there was only one other formal meeting
                  with a Chinook chief. Near the end of February 1806, Fort Clatsop's routine was
                  interrupted by the arrival of Taucum and some twenty-five Chinook men. This was
                  the largest Indian delegation to come to the fort, and no doubt some in the
                  expedition nervously fingered their weapons during their stay. Any fears about
                  Taucum's intentions, however, were quickly laid to rest. The Chinook chief had
                  been dealing peacefully with white traders for more than a decade, and he was not
                  about to endanger such good relations or to attack well-armed men. Taucum
                  evidently came to the fort more out of curiosity than a serious interest in
                  negotiation. There was, after all, nothing to negotiate, nor were the white
                  strangers real traders. Whatever his motives, the chief made it plain that his was
                  a friendly call. Impressed by his good looks and taller-than-average stature,
                  Lewis and Clark gave Taucum as warm an official welcome as they ever offered any
                  costal chief. The Indian and his entourage were fed and "plyed plentifully with
                  smoke." Throughout the afternoon Taucum and his friends enjoyed food and tobacco
                  but evidently had no interest in hearing about the ideas of the "great chief of
                  the Seventeen great nations." Almost as an afterthought, Lewis and Clark presented
                  the chief with a medal. Taucum "seemed much gratified" but many have believed that
                  it was no more than his just due. If the Chinook thought the medal was a sign of
                  the expedition's trust and good will, he was quite mistaken. At sunset Taucum an
                  his party were hustled unceremoniously out of the fort as if they were an
                  unwelcome set of traders selling rotten fish. As if to justify such inhospitable
                  conduct, Lewis wrote a long, vindictive journal entry filled with frightening
                  images of treacherous Indians lurking around the fort ready to pounce on
                  unsuspecting explorers. Fort Clatsop may have been secure that night, but closing
                  the gates at dusk was hardly a way to impress important and powerful
                     neighbors.<ref target="n0819" n="19"/>
               </p>
               <p> If Lewis and Clark's diplomatic relations with neighbors across the Columbia
                  proved oddly inconclusive, much the same was the case in their dealings with the
                  nearby Clatsops. Those Indians, some four hundred strong living in three
                  autonomous villages, had several chiefs, including Coboway, Shanoma, and
                  Warhalott. Coboway, known to the explorers as Comowooll or Conia, was the only
                  Clatsop chief who had any recorded contact with the expedition. Early in December,
                  with Fort Clatsop still under construction, Coboway led two canoes of his folk to
                  pay a call on the white newcomers. The chief exchanged some wappato, shannetahque,
                  and a small sea otter pelt for some fishhooks and a small sack of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> tobacco. Despite the bustle of construction, Lewis and Clark
                  treated the Clatsop delegation "with as much attention as we could." Coboway was
                  given a medal, but with trade goods already in short supply, others in the
                  delegation probably found American hospitality somewhat meager on the material
                  side. Coboway's visit predated the regulations limiting overnight stays, so the
                  chief spent the night with the explorers.<ref target="n0820" n="20"/> From
                  Coboway's point of view, the visit had mixed results. He must have been pleased
                  with the attention paid to him, but the evident poverty of the explorers was
                  disappointing. If Coboway thought he had scored a victory in having Fort Clatsop
                  on his side of the river, he never pressed that advantage, nor did the Chinooks
                  see the expedition's wintering place as a slight aimed at them. Lewis and Clark
                  made no promises to any chief and evidently sought nothing more than a friendly
                  but distant relationship.</p>
               <p> During the winter, the explorers were visited by two other delegations from
                  nearby villages. In each case, the Indians took the initiative in making contact
                  with the Americans. At the end of December, a young Wahkiakum chief and several
                  people from his village came up the Netul for trade and talk. Once again,
                  expedition records do not reveal what, if any, official words passed between the
                  chief and the captains. The Wahkiakum was given a small medal and, like the
                  Assinboin band chief Chechank at Fort Mandan, a piece of ribbon to put on his
                     hat.<ref target="n0821" n="21"/> Early in January, the Cathlemat chief
                  Shahharwarcap and eleven men ventured to the fort. Lewis gave the chief a medal of
                  the smallest size and in return received some wappato and tobacco. Following
                  protocol, Lewis then offered some twine for a skimming net. After some time in
                  trading, Shahharwarcap was escorted out of the fort at sunset and spent the night
                  in the woods.<ref target="n0822" n="22"/> These contacts with Wahkiakum and
                  Cathlamet chiefs hardly qualify as talks, but they did round out a network of
                  reasonably friendly relations between Fort Clatsop and the surrounding
                  villages.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's diplomacy at Fort Clatsop was characterized by modest goals and
                  relative inaction. At Fort Mandan there had been a sense of urgency in talks with
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and Hidatsas. The captains had had a clear picture of
                  United States interests on the Missouri, even if their grasp of tribal politics
                  had been less sure. But similar clarity was lacking at Fort Clatsop. American
                  interests in the Pacific Northwest were as yet unformed. The trade empire Lewis
                  and Clark represented was centered in the St. Louis of the Chouteau brothers and
                  Manuel Lisa, not the New York of John Jacob Astor. Here the explorers were
                  uncertain of and uninterested in village and band rivalries. It is revealing that
                  Comcomly, the Chinook headman who emerged in the period after Lewis and Clark as
                  the most powerful political leader in the area, never visited Fort Clatsop.
                  Whatever diplomatic initiatives there were during the winter came from the Indians
                  themselves. It was very rare for whites to winter in the region, and the natives'
                  visits to the fort may be interpreted as an effort to determine the intentions of
                  the expedition. If there was a network of "understandings" binding the Indians and
                  the explorers, it was the result of action by the former. By the second winter,
                  the explorers had expended not only the material substance of diplomacy but much
                  of their intellectual capital as well. Perhaps it seemed enough to fulfill the
                  forms of diplomacy with the few remaining flags and medals, leaving the substance
                  to others.</p>
               <p> If Lewis and Clark were reluctant traders and inactive diplomats, they better
                  fulfilled their ethnographic responsibilities. The Fort Clatsop diaries are
                  enlivened with a wealth of information on lower Chinookan life, including drawings
                  of weapons, canoes, and the tools of daily life. At Fort Mandan, Lewis and Clark
                  had used a wide variety of techniques to gather and preserve information about the
                  Indians: interviews, direct observation, participation in ceremonies, and
                  collection of artifacts. The results of that considerable effort were recorded in
                  journals, maps, and the impressive "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." Knowing what
                  they did well and what was possible, the expedition's ethnographers centered on
                  describing Indian material culture. If past experience meant anything, the
                  expedition was admirably prepared to document the lives of the coastal people.
                  That the Fort Clatsop ethnographic achievement proved somehow less major than
                  expected was the result of a whole battery of information gathering problems, some
                  beyond the expedition's control and others of its own making.</p>
               <p> It has become a historical commonplace to describe the Chinookans encountered by
                  Lewis and Clark as "a decadent stock." In a burst of rhetoric more colorful than
                  accurate, Bernard De Voto branded the Chinooks and their kin as "dullwitted,
                  thievish, lying, [and] rotten with gonorrhoea and the pox"<ref target="n0823" n="23"/> Although others have not written such powerful slander, students of
                  the expedition have often assumed that Chinookan life was somehow a "culture in
                  decline." This latter-day estimate would have astonished everyone from white
                  traders and explorers to the Indians themselves. When Lewis and Clark came to the
                  coast in 1805, they found a thriving people fully at one with a bountiful physical
                  environment. Arguments about cultural decline to the contrary, the maritime fur
                  trade had dramatically enhanced the wealth and power of the coastal people. As one
                  story describing the advent of metal trade goods put it, "the people bought this
                  and the Clatsop became rich."<ref target="n0824" n="24"/> Like those ingenious
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> who dismantled a corn grinder to make tools more
                  suited to their own needs, the Chinookans bought only certain European goods and
                  then quickly made them part of native life. The assertion that the Chinookans were
                  "dull-witted" would have brought looks of disbelief from white merchants who knew
                  firsthand the talents of Indian traders. To be fair, it must be said also that
                  there was probably no more veneral disease on the coast than at Fort Mandan. The
                  expedition's experience suggests that more men had the ailment at Fort Mandan than
                  at Fort Clatsop. And as for the charge that the Chinookans were liars, it is
                  revealing that the only serious case of deception during the winter involved the
                  expedition and not the natives. Coboway, Cuscalar, Taucum, and the women who
                  worked for Delashelwilt's wife was neither noble nor savage. Their lives moved to
                  a pattern often difficult for the explorers to discern. It was just as hard for
                  the natives to comprehend the Lewis and Clark expedition.<ref target="n0825" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark were always drawn to the characteristic objects of Indian life.
                  Few items more fully symbolized native cultures on the Northwest Coast than the
                  canoe. From the first time they saw such canoes on the Columbia, Lewis and Clark
                  admired their way in the water and the skill of those who paddled them through
                  heaving river swells. From the Tlingits of British Columbia down to the coastal
                  Salish of Oregon, there were five distinctive canoe styles in use. Ranging south
                  from British Columbia to the mouth of the Columbia River and then up to the
                  Cascades, the Chinook or Nootka canoe was a dominant style. The Chinook canoe,
                  typically twenty to thirty-five feet long with a flat bottom, was quickly
                  recognizable by its separate wood piece fitted over an undercut prow and a sharp,
                  vertical stern. The cutwater canoe, common among lower Chinookans, obtained its
                  name from the use of a board cutwater placed on the prow. Cutwaters were often
                  thirty to thirty-five feet long and carried ten to twelve persons and considerable
                  cargo. Also widespread in coastal Washington and Oregon and on the lower Columbia
                  was the shovel-nose canoe. This style was the only kind used above The Dalles.
                  Shovel-noses could be recognized by their distinctive sharply undercut prow and
                  stern. This canoe was usually some fifteen feet long and maneuvered by two or
                  three paddlers. Perhaps the most impressive and certainly the most memorable canoe
                  in lower Chinookan waters was the double cutwater style. This very large canoe,
                  usually thirty-five feet or longer, had cutwater boards at both bow and stern.
                  More important, both ends were decorated with large carved totem animals. Finally,
                  there were several kinds of simple hunting canoes.<ref target="n0826" n="26"/>
               </p>
               <p> In a long, illustrated journal entry dated February 1, 1806, both Lewis and Clark
                  presented detailed descriptions of four of the five canoe styles of the Northwest
                  Coast. The first canoe in the sequence of Lewis's drawings was the shovel-nose.
                  Lewis and Clark had often seen the Cathlamets and Wahkiakums use these small
                  canoes around the "marshey Islands" near their villages. Second in Lewis's
                  illustrated entry was the Chinook, the sort of canoe that may have been frequently
                  drawn up on the banks of the Netul. The third drawing depicted the cutwater canoe.
                  Both explorers noted its use up to The Dalles as well as its unmistakable cutwater
                  board. That feature of native naval design was something neither man had ever
                  seen, and both admitted that on first sight they had confused the bow for the
                  stern, perhaps thinking the board was a simple rudder. Like every outsider who
                  ever saw the double cutwater, Lewis and Clark were impressed by its size and
                  ornamentation. Lewis's drawing shows a large double cutwater with what may be a
                  human figure on the prow and a carving, clearly of an animal, at the stern. When
                  Clark visited the Tillamook-Clatsop village at present-day Seaside, Oregon, he
                  measured a double cutwater but evidently either forgot or mislaid the figures when
                  writing his entry.<ref target="n0827" n="27"/>
               </p>
               <p> The explorers knew that there was more to say about canoes beyond simple physical
                  characteristics. Like James G. Swan who spent three years among the Chinooks in
                  the 1850s, they understood that "the manufacture of a canoe is a work of great
                  moment with these Indians." A brief but accurate discussion of construction
                  techniques and materials completed the captains' journal entry. Impressed by the
                  canoe themselves, Lewis and Clark were even more taken with the skill of their
                  builders. With a chisel made from a worn file embedded in a wooden handle, Indian
                  craftsmen made boats marked by easy handling and graceful lines. "A person would
                  suppose," wrote the captains, "that the forming of a large canoe like this was the
                  work of several years; but these people make then in several weeks." It was no
                  wonder that canoes were prized possessions not to be traded away except at the
                  highest prices.<ref target="n0828" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> Some of the best of Lewis and Clark's ethnography responded to Jefferson's
                  requirement that they describe Indian "food, clothing, &amp; domestic
                  accomodations." Throughout its journey, the expedition took careful note of Indian
                  architecture, recording the designs and construction principles of earth lodges,
                  tepees, brush wickiups, and on the Northwest Coast, plank houses. Lewis and Clark
                  first encountered plank houses around The Dalles and saw them with increasing
                  frequency downriver. Drawing on observations made during the winter, they were
                  able to describe in considerable detail the size, shape, and materials for a
                  Chinookan plank dwelling.</p>
               <p> Although there was some variety in the plank house's size and shape, depending on
                  local circumstances and the status of the inhabitants, Lewis and Clark found a
                  common overall plan and structure. After finding a proper location with good
                  access to water and enough sunlight, Indian builders excavated a pit some three to
                  five feet deep. When finished, the pit measured anywhere from fourteen by twenty
                  to forty by one hundred feet on its sides. A strong framework of cedar timber
                  posts and gables was then erected over the pit. Split cedar boards were then
                  driven into the ground vertically so that the tops of these planks could be
                  attached to the gable rafters and eave poles. Roofs were made with thin planks,
                  sometimes laid in a double thickness. Oval door openings often provided a place
                  for Chinookan craftsmen to demonstrate their considerable carving abilities.
                  Entrances were made to appear as animal or human mouths. When Lewis and Clark
                  visited the Cathlamet village on the return journey, they noted such designs,
                  "some of these which represented human figures setting and supporting the burthen
                  on their shoulders."<ref target="n0829" n="29"/>
               </p>
               <p> The insides of those houses were filled with the domestic clutter of Chinookan
                  daily life. Sleeping mats, bowls, knives, bags, digging sticks, and clothing were
                  only some of the items in a typical coastal household inventory. It was not until
                  the drawings and paintings of John Webber, an artist with Captain Cook at Nootka
                  Sound, and Paul Kane, a nineteenth-century artist, became better known that there
                  was visual confirmation of what Lewis and Clark first described. The explorers
                  provided a catalog of the utensils that the Chinookans used every day. Their
                  journals contain accurate descriptions of wooden bowls, reed mats, different sizes
                  of woven rush bags, and "neet trenchers made of wood." There is a fine account of
                  root-digging sticks with a simple sketch to illustrate the tool. Lewis also made
                  drawings of several weapons, including clubs, swords, and the common double-bladed
                     handknife.<ref target="n0830" n="30"/>
               </p>
               <p> Food and clothing did not escape the ethnographer's eyes. In a long journal entry
                  written on a dismal, rainy day in January, Lewis took pains to describe "the
                  Culinary articles of the Indians in our neighbourhood." Handsomely carved bowls,
                  water baskets that doubled as hats, and horn spoons were all duly noted, as was
                  the proper way to roast fish on a skewer. Lewis and Clark would not have
                  recognized the word <hi rend="italic">ethnobotany,</hi> but their observations on
                  the natives' use of plants as a major food source has no equal in the literature
                  of early exploration. The captains were no less attentive to Chinookan clothing.
                  Despite Lewis's ill-tempered outburst proclaiming Chinookan female dress and
                  ornament as "the most disgusting sight I have ever beheld," the journals contain
                  remarkably precise descriptions of native dress. At one point, Clark summarized:
                  "All go litely dressed ware nothing below the waist in the coldest weather, a pice
                  of fur around their bodies and a short robe composes the sum total of their dress,
                  except a fiew hats, and beads about their necks arms and lets."<ref target="n0831" n="31"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark were especially fascinated by the unique and skillfully made hats
                  worn by Indians up and down the coast. Made of cedar and bear grass, these
                  brimless, cone-shaped hats were often decorated with geometric or pictorial
                  figures woven into them. Clark saw a common Nootka design and described it as
                  "faint representations of the whales, the Canoes, and the harpooners Strikeing
                  them." Lewis was impressed with their practical design, writing, "They are nearly
                  waterproof, light, and I am convinced are much more durable than either chip or
                  straw." The explorers found such hats so well-suited to endless days of rain that
                  they purchased several for themselves, drew four pictures of them, and took one
                  back for Charles Willson Peale's Philadelphia museum.<ref target="n0832" n="32"/>
               </p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's ethnography was never an end in itself, but was always intended
                  for the service of government policy or commercial expansion. When Jefferson
                  instructed Lewis to learn about the "ordinary occupations" of native people, he
                  had in mind the ways that Indian economic patterns might fit into an American
                  trade system. Knowing that an essential part of their mission was to lay the
                  foundations of future "commercial intercourse," the explorers paid special
                  attention to Indian trade routes and the kinds of goods that passed along them. By
                  the time Lewis and Clark got to The Dalles, they were experienced in analyzing
                  trade networks and their potential for the eager merchants of St. Louis. The
                  Northwest Coast contained an exchange system every bit as extensive as that at the
                  Mandan villages. Had Lewis and Clark been farther north, they might have had a
                  closer look at the maritime fur trade, but their location near the Columbia
                  nonetheless provided a good place to watch a stream of brass tea kettles, blue
                  beads, wappato, and pelts pass around a circle of Indian and white hands.<ref target="n0833" n="33"/>
               </p>
               <p> Despite the fact that more than one hundred American ships had been engaged in
                  fur operations on the Northwest Coast between 1788 and 1803, Lewis knew very
                  little about the organization or the schedule of that trade. When he gathered his
                  notes and began writing about coastal trade, he did not know whether traders who
                  visited the Columbia came from Nootka Sound or made the river their first stop on
                  voyages direct from England or the United States. Lewis was equally unsure about
                  the existence of a trading post somewhere on the Pacific coast south of the
                  Columbia. Strangely enough, the explorer did not even appear aware of the role of
                  Hawaii as an important resupply point, although he speculated that "some island in
                  the pacific ocean" was perhaps being used in the trade. From Indians, Lewis
                  learned that traders came to the Columbia in April, anchored at Bakers Bay, and
                  stayed some six or seven months. More important, he was able to learn what sort of
                  goods the Indians were anxious to obtain. Those goods ranged from high quality
                  two- and three-point blankets and coarse cloth to sheet copper and brassware. Also
                  in demand were knives, fishhooks, pots, kettles, and firearms. The Chinookans
                  enjoyed sporting European fashions, making castoff sailors' clothing an item for
                  exchange. Of course, there was always a market for blue beads, known in the
                  Chinook trade jargon as <hi rend="italic">tyee-kamosuk</hi> or "chief beads." In
                  return, the maritime traders obtained dressed and undressed elk skins, sea otter
                  and beaver pelts, and so Lewis thought, dried salmon. Lewis knew that vast
                  quantities of pounded fish came down from The Dalles market but frankly could not
                  understand why white traders wanted it. Later he discovered that he had
                  misinterpreted Indian information. The salmon was not meant for the sailors but
                  was part of a large domestic trade of which the tall ships were only a small
                     part.<ref target="n0834" n="34"/>
               </p>
               <p> The extensive native trade network also got the expedition's attention. Lewis
                  knew about the role of The Dalles as "the great mart for all the country." After
                  further investigation, he better understood the flow of pounded salmon and
                  European goods up and down the river. Typical of the exchanges that Lewis was able
                  to trace were a variety of products from blubber and whale oil to wappato and
                  beads. On one day in January, Lewis watched Cathlamet canoes loaded with upriver
                  wappato destined for the Clatsop towns. At those towns the wappato would be traded
                  for blubber and oil, items the Clatsops obtained from their Tillamook neighbors.
                  The Clatsops, rich in European trade goods, paid for the whale products with beads
                  and metal. "In this manner," explained Lewis, "is a trade continually carryed on
                  by the natives of the river each trading some article or other with their
                  neighbors above and below them; and thus articles which are vended by the whites
                  at the enterence of this river, find their way to the most distant nations
                  enhabiting its waters."<ref target="n0835" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p> Whenever Lewis and Clark ventured beyond describing objects to write about the
                  "character" of an Indian group they ran afoul of powerful stereotypes that had
                  long been a part of the Euro-American frontier experience. The explorers could and
                  did have good relations with individual Indians, but when they tried to evaluate
                  whole cultures, traditional attitudes and categories almost always came to the
                  surface. Until they reached the Columbia, Lewis and Clark made do with two
                  stereotypes for Indians. There were the Missouri River villagers, potential
                  American customers and allies. In the explorers' eyes, these were the good
                  Indians, sometimes childlike and potentially dangerous but good nonetheless.
                  Baptized by reason of their trade potential, cultural salvation was extended to
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"

                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and the Assinboins formed a second image. These natives Lewis and
                  Clark judged harshly, not necessarily because they were nomads but for their links
                  to British traders. This negative evaluation was not unchangeable. If Black
                  Buffalo's warriors abandoned their English friends, they might be redeemed and
                  welcomed into the American congregation. Such attitudes were intellectually
                  satisfying and practically useful; they provided quick reference points as the
                  expedition moved through a maze of Indians in an unknown land. Facial features,
                  treatment of women and the elderly, differing traditions of hospitality toward
                  strangers, economies of hunting and farming, even the sounds of language—all
                  of these could be put into familiar mental pictures that made the world
                  comprehensible.</p>
               <p> But in the Northwest those reassuring images were challenged in disturbing ways.
                  Here were people who made graceful caneos but flattened the heads of their
                  children, carved beautiful designs on wooden bowls but squatted like frogs, and
                  bargained with Yankee skill but had a language that sounded like hens clucking.
                  The Chinookans simply did not fit into any convenient mental category. They were
                  villagers who did not farm and warriors who preferred trade to combat. How could
                  they be "Indians" when they did not look or act like any "Indian" the expedition
                  had yet encountered? Confronted with human beings and cultural patterns that did
                  not conform to the familiar categories, Lewis and Clark fell back on intellectual
                  positions prepared by previous generations of Indian-white contact. At a moment
                  when it might have been possible to escape the thrall of perceptions that had held
                  Europeans since the Age of Reconnaissance, Lewis and Clark chose to reassert the
                  familiar themes of native treachery and brutality. Language more suited to the
                  bloody engagements in the Ohio country of the 1790s was conferred on the coastal
                  people. Lewis and Clark had a singular chance to see the Indians beyond
                  stereotype; to see them as inventive, adaptable men and women living prosperous
                  lives between the mountains and the sea. That the explorers failed to transcend
                  their own past is a measure of how deeply rooted those mental categories had
                  become for white Americans.</p>
               <p> When Lewis and Clark offered negative evaluations of the Chinookans they usually
                  focused on two features of coastal life, one physical and the other behavioral.
                  There is no doubt that they found the shape of Columbia and coastal peoples
                  unattractive. Like other Euro-Americans, the explorers were conditioned to admire
                  tall, slender bodies. Thin lips, narrow noses, and small feet were all essential
                  parts of the body beautiful. Although the plains and plateau Indians came close to
                  that image, the river and coastal folk surely did not. Lewis and Clark repeatedly
                  used the words "low," "illy formed," and "badly made" to describe Chinookan
                  bodies. Lewis wrote, "They are low in stature, rather diminutive and illy shapen;
                  possessing thick broad flat feet, thick ankles, crooked legs, wide mouths, thick
                  lips, nose moderately large, fleshey, wide at the extremity with large nostrils,
                  black eyes and black coarse hair."<ref target="n0836" n="36"/> Although its
                  unflattering aspects were surely intended, this physical portrait is generally
                  accurate. More important, it does not directly engage in the kinds of racial
                  typing common later in the century, nor is its language as harsh as that used by
                  later travelers to the coast. It is worth recalling that the most vindictive thing
                  said about Indians in the extant journals—Lewis's cruel characterization of
                  hungry men eating uncooked meat as savage brutes—described <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, not Chinookans.</p>
               <p> But the behavior of some coastal Indians was hardly endearing. From The Dalles
                  down to the coast, Lewis and Clark were troubled by repeated incidents of theft.
                  Those thefts posed two quite distinct problems. Plainly the expedition could not
                  afford to lose tools, weapons, and valuable trade goods. But on another level, the
                  explorers found persistent theft a habit hard to understand. Differing concepts of
                  property, notions of communal sharing, increased commercialization of native life,
                  and theft as an attention-getting tactic were all explanations that did not occur
                  to the ethnographers in the expedition. Instead, Lewis speculated that thievery
                  was an irreducible part of the coastal Indians' psyche. "I therefore believe," he
                  wrote, "this trait in their character proceeds from an avaricious all grasping
                     disposition."<ref target="n0837" n="37"/>
               </p>
               <p> The captains may not have liked their Fort Clatsop neighbors nor wanted their
                  constant company, but at the same time, they said very positive things that must
                  not be overlooked. Indeed, they had as many favorable things to say about the
                  Chinookans as they had about plains or plateau Indians. For all the talk about
                  "badly made," thievish natives, Lewis and Clark found Coboway and his kin "mild
                  inoffensive people." Hospitality toward strangers was evident when Clark visited a
                  Clatsop house and was treated with "extrodeanary friendship." The explorers were
                  equally impressed with Chinookan family life, noting that "the greatest harmoney
                  appears to exist among them." "Cheerful but never gay," possessed with "good
                  memories," "very loquacious and inquisitive," the Chinookans may have sometimes
                  seemed like transplanted Yankee peddlars—not a wholly flattering estimate,
                  come to think of it, from men with Virginia and backcountry roots.<ref target="n0838" n="38"/>
               </p>
               <p> By the time Lewis and Clark wintered at Fort Clatsop, they had settled on several
                  ways to record ethnographic information. Journals, maps, vocabularies, artifacts,
                  and tabular estimates were all familiar parts of their ethnography. At Fort
                  Clatsop, the bulk of material about the Indians was written by Lewis in long
                  journal entries. Each entry was a miniature essay on a particular aspect of Indian
                  material culture or behavior. On subjects ranging from trade routes and hunting
                  techniques to clothing styles and burial practices, Lewis's essays represent a
                  substantial achievement in the history of ethnography. They reflect his keen
                  powers of observation and a remarkable ability to bring objects alive with
                     words.<ref target="n0839" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although the journals of the captains hold much valuable information about the
                  Indians, the same cannot be said of the diaries kept by Sergeants Ordway and Gass.
                  Earlier in the voyage, Ordway often had recorded telling bits of native life. The
                  look of an Arikara cornfield or the unique sound of the Salish language were
                  things that he would not miss putting in his journal. Gass could be equally
                  observant, especially about Indian houses. But during the winter on the coast, the
                  sergeants' powers of observation declined. For reasons that are not clear, their
                  journals are thin and without significant ethnographic value.</p>
               <p> Perhaps the greatest advance in ethnographic recording at Fort Clatsop was the
                  inclusion of illustrations in the journals. Drawings had appeared briefly when the
                  party spent time with the Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, but at Fort Clatsop the illustrative art flowered. Whatever
                  the cause for the drawings, whether sheer boredom or genuine interest in new
                  subjects, these visual records provide a new dimension to the expedition's
                  ethnography. Sketches of North Coast hats, swords, clubs, knives, and arrows dot
                  the journal pages, as do drawings of fishhooks, digging sticks, canoes, and
                  paddles. These drawings continue to enliven our understanding of Chinookan life.
                  Most striking is Clark's simple but powerful set of sketches depicting Chinookan
                  heads and a head-flattening cradleboard.<ref target="n0840" n="40"/> The quality
                  and perceptiveness in the Fort Clatsop drawings makes one wish that the captains
                  had discovered their artistic gifts earlier and practiced them longer.</p>
               <p> The comprehensive "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" had been the lasting
                  ethnographic accomplishment to come out of Fort Mandan. At Fort Clatsop, Lewis and
                  Clark attempted a similar estimate for western Indians but with far less success.
                  Abandoning the interrogative and comparative structure that made the eastern
                  estimate so valuable and remarkable, the explorers settled for a simple list of
                  tribes, bands, and villages with populations given in numbers of lodges and
                  persons. The "Estimate of Western Indians" was begun at Fort Clatsop, revised
                  during the return journey, and further annotated by Clark when the expedition had
                  ended. In organization, the western estimate is a straightforward recital of
                  native groups, moving from the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref>, and several <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> bands to the Yakimas, Wanapams, and Walulas encountered at
                  the junction of the Snake and Columbia rivers. The estimate enumerates the
                  Columbia River Sahaptians and Chinookans, reaching east to the Shahala or Cascade
                  Indians. Then applying an unusual economic or botanical standard, the explorers
                  list bands from the Cascades of the Columbia to the Cowlitz River as "wappato
                  Indians." These include the Clatskanies, a number of groups living around Wappato
                  or Sauvies Island, and the Skilloots. Moving to the coast, the estimate records
                  the Wahkiakums, Cathlamets, Chinooks-proper, and Clatsops.</p>
               <p> Because Lewis and Clark never traveled farther south along the Oregon coast than
                  the Tillamook village of Necost, their information on groups much past Cape
                  Lookout was very sketchy. The explorers knew the names and locations of the
                  Tillamook towns around Tillamook Bay. Perhaps based on information gathered during
                  Clark's visit, the estimate contains a list of Salish and Yakonan speakers south
                  to Cape Blanco and the Rogue River. Lewis and Clark had even less information from
                  the Chinooks-proper north along the coast. The few contacts with Chinooks during
                  the winter made the estimate of those in the northern reaches meager indeed. Under
                  one entry, Lewis and Clark listed a number of groups along the Washington coast as
                  far north as the Quinaults on the Olympic Peninsula. When Clark made his brief
                  reconnaissance up the Willamette River on the return journey, listings were added
                  for bands and peoples commonly known as the Multnomahs. Also noted were groups of
                  Sahaptian speakers living on the middle Columbia above the Snake-Columbia
                  junction. For all the care Lewis and Clark took with it, the western estimate has
                  a barebones quality. Whether it was a failure of energy, imagination, or
                  information, the document did not meet the standard set at Fort Mandan.<ref target="n0841" n="41"/>
               </p>
               <p> The weaknesses in the "Estimate of the Western Indians" reflect the deeper
                  problems that made Fort Clatsop ethnography less successful than the studies
                  undertaken a winter earlier. The explorers had not abandoned their commitment to
                  "name the nations," nor had they suddenly lost their descriptive skills. At Fort
                  Clatsop, Lewis and Clark were up against a battery of information-gathering
                  problems, some of their own making and others simply beyond remedy.</p>
               <p> Fort Mandan had been ideally situated for ethnographic field work. Two Mandan
                  villages and three Hidatsa ones were close by. Because these villages were the
                  center for northern plains trade, Lewis and Clark had access to Indian information
                  far beyond the range of their own travels. If Fort Mandan was set at what
                  geographer John Allen has aptly termed "the keystone of the upper Missouri
                  region," Fort Clatsop was isolated in a cultural backwater.<ref target="n0842" n="42"/> Only one small Clatsop village was within easy walking distance. The
                  Chinook villages on the north side of the Columbia seemed as remote as the
                  Tillamook towns to the south.</p>
               <p> Compounding the physical isolation at Fort Clatsop was the restrictive visiting
                  policy discussed above. Unfortunately, the evening curfew was enforced in an
                  atmosphere of fear and distrust. Then, too, the coastal Indians did not find the
                  white men a novelty and were disappointed by their slim store of trading goods.
                  The result was far fewer Indian visitors than there had been at Fort Mandan and a
                  sketchier ethnographic record. Lewis and Clark may have felt more secure with
                  fewer Indians about, but their cultural isolation yielded a written record long on
                  objects and short on those who made and used them.<ref target="n0843" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p> That mental and physical distance from Indians meant fewer native informants.
                  Even with Indians like Coboway, Cuscalar, and Delashelwilt—men who visited
                  the fort fairly regularly—Lewis and Clark never developed the sort of
                  rapport they had had with Black Cat, Sheheke, or many other Mandan Indians. Some
                  of that difficulty was a matter of language. However difficult and time-consuming
                  the translations at Fort Mandan, at least the words and sentences had been
                  forthcoming. At Fort Clatsop, translation was much more difficult. No one in the
                  party could speak the Chinookan language, and the explorers evidently picked up
                  only a rudimentary knowledge of the trade jargon. Over and over, Lewis lamented:
                  "I cannot understand them sufficiently to make any enquiries."<ref target="n0844" n="44"/>
               </p>
               <p> During the winter at Fort Mandan, many of the gaps in Indian information could be
                  filled by traders like Jusseaume, Charbonneau, and Heney. At Fort Clatsop, there
                  was no comparable group of knowledgeable whites for Lewis and Clark to question.
                  Already hemmed in by inhospitable weather, miserable food, and a strange language,
                  the absence of helpful traders deepened the expedition's isolation and
                  ignorance.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> The winter at Fort Clatsop wore on in days of cold drizzle. The men habitually
                  noted in their journals that "nothing worthy of notice occurred today." No sooner
                  had the fort been built than the whole party began "counting the days which
                  seperate us from the 1st of April and which bind us to fort Clatsop."<ref target="n0845" n="45"/> In the routine of hunting, cooking, mending, and
                  salt-boiling, several incidents stand out to reveal the lights and shadows of
                  personal relations between the explorers and the Indians. Some of these are no
                  more than snapshots from the Fort Clatsop family album, but at least two might be
                  short films on the subject of friendship betrayed.</p>
               <p> At Fort Mandan, Indians and explorers had been allies in a struggle to survive a
                  plains winter. But at Fort Clatsop their relationship was at best an armed truce.
                  Yet there must have been moments, especially at trading times, when something like
                  the atmosphere of that plains winter crept into the Fort Clatsop compound. The
                  Chinooks were convivial folk who enjoyed storytelling and good company. Their zest
                  for life was reflected in a delight with bargaining that went beyond business into
                  the realm of sport. Lewis and Clark never recorded any of the arresting tales in
                  coastal oral tradition, nor do their journals contain any hints of the actual
                  words that passed between Indians and whites. But in a memorable entry written by
                  Lewis, there is a hint of those brief times when neighbors shared trade and food.
                  "With us," he recalled, "their conversation generally turns upon the subjects of
                  trade, smoking, eating or their women; about the latter they speak without reserve
                  in their presents, of their every part, and of the most formiliar connection."<ref target="n0846" n="46"/> In journal entries usually empty of an Indian presence,
                  this is an especially vivid picture. Earthy talk, a sly wink or pointed finger,
                  and the forceful way the Chinookans blew smoke from their lungs—all lent a
                  flash of color to otherwise gray days.</p>
               <p> Talk about that "most formiliar connection" is a reminder that sexual liaisons
                  with Indian women had been part of the life of the expedition at least since the
                  time at the Arikara villages. Lewis certainly was not surprised, and he wisely
                  purchased the proper medical supplies in Philadelphia to cope with venereal
                  disease. The captains simply accepted sexual relations as part of frontier life
                  and were worried only if they endangered the expedition's health or security. It
                  is probably safe to say that "Louis Veneris" was an unpaid, unenlisted, but
                  ever-present member of the Corps of Discovery throughout its long voyage.</p>
               <p> Clark once wrote that Chinook women were "lude and carry on sport publickly," and
                  added that "the Clotsops and others appear deffident, and reserved."<ref target="n0847" n="47"/> His unflattering assessment of Chinook morals and the
                  differences in behavior of women on either side of the Columbia brings us closer
                  to understanding why sex was so freely offered to the Americans. With the coming
                  of white traders in the mid-1790s, Chinook women began to play an increasingly
                  important role in an expanding native economy. Trusted by whites who perhaps
                  feared males, Chinook women soon became the principal intermediaries between fur
                  merchants and their own kin. Women operated their own business canoes and were
                  regularly consulted on trade matters by men on both sides of the counter. In a
                  culture that frowned on sexual intercourse only if it involved incest, it was
                  reasonable for these women to use their own sexual favors and those of others to
                  make and seal trade agreements. Women who made personal and business alliances
                  with traders enhanced the wealth of their own families. Certainly the Chinook who
                  was reported to be "Mr. Haley's favorite woman" brought influence and material
                  rewards to her family. The young woman who had "J. Bowmon" tattooed on her arm
                  probably had a similar relationship with that trader. The plains people, concerned
                  with acquiring spirit power, had used sex as one means to gain that end. The
                  Chinookans, whose lives focused on trading and material wealth, saw sex as an
                  equally valid way to amass the goods that signaled power and prestige.<ref target="n0848" n="48"/> In a telling set of remarks made in a speech to the
                  Mercantile Library Association of Boston in 1846, one-time coastal trader William
                  Sturgis observed, "Among a portion of the Indians, the management of trade is
                  entrusted to the women. The reason given by the men was, that women could talk
                  with white men <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than they could, and were willing to
                  talk <hi rend="italic">more.</hi>"<ref target="n0849" n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p> Encounters with Chinook women began while the expedition was still on the north
                  side of the Columbia. Toward evening on November 21, 1805, the wife of the Chinook
                  chief Delashelwilt brought six women to the American camp. Their arrival prompted
                  a brisk exchange of goods and services between young men and women who Clark
                  admitted were "handsome." "The young women sport openly with our men" was Clark's
                  understated way of reporting what must have been quite a romp. In fact, their men
                  were giving away goods at such alarming speed that Lewis and Clark were forced to
                  call a temporary halt to the good times. Finding a ready solution, the captains
                  "divided some ribbon between the men of our party to bestow on their favorite
                  Lasses, this plan to save the knives and more valuable articles."<ref target="n0850" n="50"/> These sexual contacts produced many venereal
                  complaints, belatedly recorded by Lewis and Clark the following spring.</p>
               <p> Just how often the Chinook woman, now known as "the old baud," brought her
                  following to Fort Clatsop is not clear. Although Lewis and Clark remained silent
                  on the subject, there are some clues to suggest that sexual contacts were fairly
                  regular. Exchanging goods for sex may have led to the stern prohibition against
                  selling "any tool or iron or steel instrument, arms, accoutrements or ammunicion,"
                  issued as part of the General Order dealing with Indian-expedition relations. More
                  specific and less circumstantial is the evidence from Patrick Gass. The sergeant
                  reported that "the old baud" and nine girls "frequently visited our quarters." He
                  noted that sex was available at any "easy rate," and Nicholas Biddle later
                  commented that payment rates were fixed on the basis of female appearance. Medical
                  evidence for all this activity is not wanting. Lewis and Clark alluded to "many"
                  venereal complaints after the initial Chinook meeting. Although there do not
                  appear to have been as many cases at Fort Clatsop as at Fort Mandan, by January at
                  least two men—Hugh McNeal and Silas Goodrich—had contracted the
                     malady.<ref target="n0851" n="51"/>
               </p>
               <p> McNeal's case of "the pox" was certainly uncomfortable, but his "connection" to
                  one Chinook woman saved his life and probably rescued the expedition from
                  involvement in a nasty confrontation. On the evening of January 9, Clark and
                  several men were smoking with Indians at a cluster of Tillamook and Clatsop houses
                  on the Necanicum River near the coast. At ten o'clock the quiet was shattered by
                  loud calls from houses across the river. As many Indians rushed to investigate,
                  Clark's Clatsop guide told him that rumor had it someone's throat had been cut.
                  When Clark discovered that Hugh McNeal was missing, he quickly sent Sergeant Pryor
                  and four armed men to find him. Pryor had no sooner set out than he met McNeal
                  coming "in great haste." Regaining his composure, McNeal explained that he had
                  been invited to one of the houses by a Tillamook man. After sampling some blubber
                  at one lodge, the two men had gone on to another. McNeal did not know that the
                  Indian was intent on killing him for his blanket and personal effects. A Chinook
                  woman described only as "an old friend of McNeals" knew of the plot and seized the
                  American by his blanket cape in an effort to thwart the scheme. Still unaware that
                  his life was at risk, McNeal pushed the woman away. Undaunted, she then alerted
                  the village. In the commotion that followed, McNeal's would-be assassin escaped.
                  Clark provided a proper ending to the whole escapade when he dubbed the Necanicum
                  "McNeal's Folly Creek."<ref target="n0852" n="52"/>
               </p>
               <p> Sex sometimes had comic overtones. When a Clatsop man brought his sister as
                  payment for medical attention, the offer was swiftly rejected. Not to be denied,
                  the woman took up residence with the Charbonneau family. Once her presence was
                  known, a number of men in the expedition came knocking on her door only to find
                  their "solicitations" turned down. After two or three days of sulking around the
                  fort, the woman finally realized that medical bills were easier to incur than to
                     pay.<ref target="n0853" n="53"/> In mid-March, as the party prepared to leave
                  Fort Clatsop, Delashelwilt, "the old baud," and six girls made camp outside the
                  stockade and laid "close seige" to the expedition's affections. Fearing that the
                  "winning graces" of the Chinooks might touch off another epidemic of venereal
                  disease like that in November 1805 and endanger the return journey, the captains
                  delivered a stiff lecture on the dangers that waited outside the fort. The lecture
                  ended, at least so claimed Lewis and Clark, with the entire party giving "the vow
                  of celibacy." In what must be the most inappropriate gesture in expedition
                  history, Delashelwilt was then given a certificate of "good deportment." Lewis and
                  Clark might as well have gone one step further and awarded his wife and her
                  retinue a citation for meritorious service.<ref target="n0854" n="54"/>
               </p>
               <p> Friendly talk and intimate encounters made a dismal winter bearable for at least
                  some of the explorers. At those times the distances that separated explorer from
                  Indian was, if not bridged, at least narrowed. But there was a darker side to
                  Indian relations at Fort Clatsop, something that went beyond the indignity of the
                  password "no Chinook" or the inhospitable treatment afforded visiting chiefs.
                  During February and March, the expedition played out a particularly sordid tale of
                  deception and friendship betrayed. It involved a premeditated theft of a Clatsop
                  canoe in plain violation of Indian legal practice and expedition policy. Writers
                  of detective fiction later in the century might have entitled it "The Case of the
                  Purloined Canoe." Whatever the label, it proved a cautionary tale—one that
                  revealed the brand of white morality confronted by the Indians in the grim years
                  to come.</p>
               <p> What later became a blot on the expedition's honor began simply enough in early
                  February when some Clatsop Indians took six elk from George Drouillard's cache.
                  Short on food, Lewis and Clark properly complained to Coboway about the theft.
                  Following traditional practice, the chief sent a man to the fort on February 12
                  with three dogs to pay for the stolen meat. This well-intentional and legally
                  correct act went momentarily awry when the dogs bolted and ran off. But all was
                  put right when Drouillard went to the Clatsop village and retrieved the animals.
                  As far as the Indians were concerned, the case was now closed; proper restitution
                  had been made and accepted. There was every reason to believe that the
                  unpleasantness at the elk cache would be forgotten.<ref target="n0855" n="55"/>
               </p>
               <p> But in March, with preparations underway for the journey home, the incident
                  suddenly took on new life. Lewis and Clark knew they would need several Indian
                  canoes to flesh out the expedition's flotilla. Drouillard was therefore sent to
                  the Clatsop village to purchase what craft he could find. He returned with some
                  Clatsops and an "indifferent" canoe; the Indians refused to part with it even when
                  offered Lewis's fancy-dress uniform coat. Indians remained at the fort throughout
                  the day but would not sell their canoes "at a price which it was in our power to
                  give consistently with the state of our stock of merchandize."<ref target="n0856" n="56"/>
               </p>
               <p> Stymied in their efforts to obtain the necessary canoes by honest trade, a plan
                  surfaced that was at worst criminal and at best a terrible lapse of judgment. One
                  of the interpreters—either Drouillard or Charbonneau—and several other
                  men proposed the revival of the elk theft case as a pretext for taking a Clatsop
                  canoe. As Lewis blandly put it, "We yet want another canoe, and as the Clatsops
                  will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we will take one form
                  them in lue of the six elk which they stole from us in the winter." Lewis and
                  Clark were not up against the wall of survival, nor was this a food emergency. The
                  captains were abandoning a two-year tradition of never stealing from the Indians.
                  The essential honesty that distinguished Lewis and Clark from explorers like
                  Hernando DeSoto and Francisco Pizarro had been tarnished. Expedition goods were in
                  short supply, but experience always proved that patience in coastal trade usually
                  yielded a satisfactory exchange. Unfortunately, patience was not the order of the
                     day.<ref target="n0857" n="57"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the next day, March 18, an unsuspecting Coboway spent the whole day at the
                  fort. While the chief was there, four of Lewis and Clark's men slipped away toward
                  his village. Knowing where the canoes were beached, they took one and brought it
                  up near the fort. Because Coboway was still there, the thieves concealed their
                  prize nearby until he left. It had been one thing for Lewis to trick Cameahwait
                  into thinking that Clark's party was close at hand when the fate of the expedition
                  hung in the balance at Shoshoni Cove. Even then Lewis admitted his deception "set
                  a little awkward." It was another thing to cheat Coboway—a man Lewis
                  described as "friendly and decent," "kind and hospitable"—and not even feel
                  a pang of conscience.<ref target="n0858" n="58"/>
               </p>
               <p> That singular betrayal of friendship begins to make sense when projected against
                  remarks made by Lewis during the period between the stealing of the elk and the
                  stealing of the canoe. After a visit on February 20 by Taucum and a large Chinook
                  delegation, Lewis launched into a vitriolic attack on the natives. Dredging up
                  language and images rooted in two centuries of white frontier experience, Lewis
                  branded the Indians as treacherous savages beyond redemption. Brushing aside any
                  thought that the two peoples might ever be linked in genuine friendship, the
                  explorer maintained that kindness from whites had always been repaid with
                  brutality from Indians. "The too great confidence of our countrymen in their
                  sincerity and friendship," exclaimed Lewis, "has caused the destruction of many
                  hundreds of us." Turning his attention to the expedition, Lewis admitted that long
                  months of good relations with Indians made it difficult to believe the party could
                  fall victim to attack. Against that general good feeling, Lewis charged that the
                  Indians did not deserve the expedition's confidence, no matter how helpful they
                  had been. About all Indians, he declared, there was something fundamentally
                  treacherous. Lewis was determined to do everything in his power to undermine any
                  favorable impression his men had of the Indians. The central theme of Indian
                  treachery had to be drilled into their minds. The Corps of Discovery had to be
                  taught to hate. In phrases reminiscent of Puritan fears of the howling wilderness
                  and savage devils, Lewis repeated his conviction "that our preservation depends on
                  never loosing sight of this trait [treachery] in their character, and being always
                  prepared to meet it in whatever shape it may present itself."<ref target="n0859" n="59"/> With those words Lewis moved from common-sense vigilance of the sort
                  required of every explorer to a dangerous flirtation with paranoia.</p>
               <p> Lewis's ranting was not typical of either the language or the practice of the
                  expedition. It was not even typical of events during the Clatsop winter. But those
                  were powerful words that demand the historian's attention and explanation. A long
                  way from home, the expedition felt hemmed in by a strange environment and
                  seemingly unpredictable people. Isolation, loneliness, and fear—all extract
                  a high price from even the strongest and most moral. Such conditions often release
                  pent-up feelings of hostility toward outsiders. Fort Clatsop always had an
                  atmosphere of "us versus them," unlike the "we" of Fort Mandan. Lewis and Clark
                  were not the first Europeans who had their moral sensibilities challenged and then
                  eroded by the new American land. Lewis's outburst and the theft of the canoe mark
                  a low point in expedition-Indian relations.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> The winter at Fort Clatsop ended as it had begun—with overvcast skies and
                  splatters of rain. On March 23, 1806, after giving Coboway possession of their
                  winter quarters, Lewis and Clark "bid a final adieu to Fort Clatsop." Lewis
                  claimed that with the exception of not meeting any white traders, all the
                  expedition's goals had been achieved.<ref target="n0860" n="60"/> In most
                  particulars his evaluation was accurate. Secured in carefully sewn elkskin bags
                  was what amounted to a virtual catalog of western North America—its land,
                  peoples, plants, and animals. The face of a vast portion of the continent now
                  would be disclosed for all to see in journals, drawings, maps, vocabularies,
                  botanical specimens, and artifacts. If Lewis and Clark were disturbed that their
                  primary mission—finding a passage through the American garden—had not
                  yielded the result Jefferson hoped for, they did not show it. For now there was
                  only the hurry to sever those ties that for a winter had bound them to the North
                  Coast.</p>
               <p> Some eight years later there was a disquieting and sad postscript to the Fort
                  Clatop winter. On May 21, 1814, Coboway brought to the North West Company trader
                  Alexander Henry a piece of paper the chief had carefully preserved through all
                  those damp winters. Dated March 19, 1806, it was a list of the members of the
                  Corps of Discovery of the Northwest. Despite their ill treatment of him, the chief
                  obviously cherished this reminder of those his people called <hi rend="italic">pâh-shish-e-ooks,</hi> the "cloth men." Coboway's rude introduction to
                  the world of imperial rivalries came when Henry abruptly threw the document into a
                  fire and then presented the chief with a British replacement.<ref target="n0861" n="61"/> Lewis and Clark had done their work well. Lured by what the captains
                  saw, those eight years had brought a flood of Astorians, Nor'-Westers, and empire
                  builders to the Northwest. And Coboway's world had been transformed in ways hard
                  to understand and difficult to predict. </p>

               <p> When Lewis and Clark left Fort Clatsop late in March 1806, their exploring duties
                  were far from over. Ahead loomed responsibilities every bit as challenging as
                  those that had driven the explorers up the Missouri and across the mountains
                  nearly two years before. During the winter, Lewis and Clark had heard from Indian
                  sources about a river that struck south from the Columbia and reached the "gulph
                  of California." Finding that river, known to both Indians and explorers as the
                  Multinomah, raised the expedition's hopes for a trade connection into the
                  Southwest. Equally important were charting the northern course of the Marias River
                  and exploring the Yellowstone. Finally, Lewis and Clark needed to verify Indian
                  information concerning a shorter route between Travelers' Rest and the Great Falls
                  of the Missouri. All that exploring would demand skill and coordination in field
                  operations beyond anything yet attempted by the Corps of Discovery.</p>
               <p> But in all these intricate maneuvers, Indian matters were not forgotten.
                  Promoting and encouraging intertribal peace as a requisite for trade was a goal
                  from the earliest days of the journey. On the return, Lewis and Clark needed to
                  foster such notions, often in the face of long-standing tradition. Equally
                  important was the complex matter of organizing delegations of Indians to visit
                  federal officials in Washington. Like intertribal peace, this accomplishment
                  hinged on neutralizing "the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> menace." Finally, there were ethnographic tasks yet undone. In
                  their hurry to reach the Pacific, Lewis and Clark had not carefully studied the

                  the American ethnographers to record aspects of their life and culture.</p>
               <p> Speed, timing, and survival were essential for success in all these efforts.
                  Lewis and Clark were determined to reach St. Louis in one season of travel, with
                  careful planning and good fortune. The explorers had to work their way back up a
                  floodstage Columbia even more hazardous than before, avoid Indian complications at
                  the Cascades and The Dalles, and reach their horses at the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> villages before those Indians left for summer hunts. Delays
                  caused by snow on the Lolo Trail could throw their schedules seriously off track.
                  Finally, and no small matter, several field parties had to be coordinated to reach
                  the Upper Missouri before freeze-up. All told, the return journey presented
                  challenges and opportunities as great as any the expedition had yet faced.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> The cold, wet days of spring on the Columbia did nothing to boost the men's
                  spirits as they struggled back upriver. And struggle they did, since the river ran
                  higher and faster than in the fall of 1805. Although Lewis and Clark found
                  friendly treatment at several Chinookan villages along the lower Columbia, there
                  were already unsettling signs. The expedition was intent on finding the Multnomah
                  River, but information from the Indians on the short, shallow character of the
                  Quicksand (Sandy) and Seal (Washougal) rivers was troubling. A brief
                  reconnaissance of those rivers by Sergeant Pryor verified those disappointing
                  reports.</p>
               <p> But that disappointment could not match the real concern produced by news from
                  Indians coming downriver from The Dalles. Lewis and Clark had expected to
                  supplement the expedition's food stores with pounded salmon purchased from Wishram
                  and Wasco traders. Now that plan was in doubt as party after party told of
                  scarcities of food and even starvation upriver. "This information," said Lewis
                  with considerable understatement, "gave us much uneasiness with rispect to our
                  future means of subsistence." Quickly rejecting a time-consuming wait at The
                  Dalles for the first salmon run, Lewis and Clark decided to remain at their camp
                  on the north side of the river while laying in a supply of dried meat sufficient
                  for the journey to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. Such a halt would also afford Clark time to extend his
                  search for the elusive Multnomah River.<ref target="n0901" n="01"/>
               </p>
               <p> On April 2, with expeditionary hunters out on resupply missions, Clark resumed
                  his quest for the Multnomah. That effort was materially advanced when several
                  Watlala Indians came to camp to trade. With them were two young men from one of
                  the bands living on the Willamette, the river Clark would eventually select as his
                  Multnomah. From these men he obtained a sketch of the river and directions to find
                  its mouth. Convinced this was the true object of his search, Clark hired an Indian
                  pilot and took seven men to reconnoiter the Willamette. Before reaching the
                  entrance of the river, blocked from earlier view by Sauvies Island, Clark landed
                  at the large Neerchekioo village. As was so often the case with Lewis and Clark's
                  ethnography, it is not clear whether this name refers to a location, a village, or
                  a band. The captains further confused things by describing town residents as the
                  Neerchkioo tribe of the Shahhala (Watlala) nation. The village site was dominated
                  by a large plank house, with more than one hundred cutwater canoes "piled up and
                  scattered in different directions about in the woods."</p>
               <p> Exploring the Willamette was Clark's principal objective, but seeing so imposing
                  a plank house piqued his curiosity. That there might be some wappato for exchange
                  could not have been far from his mind as well. Plank houses of this size were
                  usually partitioned into several "apartments." Clark entered one of the rooms and
                  offered goods in trade for wappato. He met stony silence, "sulkey" faces, and a
                  firm rejection of his offer. Clark's mood is hard to guess. What he did next may
                  have been practical joking or the reflection of more hostile feelings. Taking a
                  piece of cannon fuse from his pocket, the explorer tossed it into the fire. As the
                  fuse sputtered and the fire changed color, Clark used a magnet on his inkstand to
                  make a compass needle spin around the rose. "Astonished and alarmed," the Indian
                  women pleaded for him to restore their "healthy" fire. They hastily put several
                  parcels of wappato at his feet. Throughout this display of technological wizardry,
                  an old blind shaman had been "speaking with great vehemunce," calling on spirit
                  forces to protect the village. The drama ended when Clark belatedly paid the women
                  for the wappato.<ref target="n0902" n="02"/>
               </p>
               <p> For all its color and comic overtones, this incident at Neerchekioo does have a
                  grimmer side. In light of the canoe-stealing episode in the last days at Fort
                  Clatsop, Clark's actions in the plank house suggest an increasing willingness to
                  bend the rules whenever it suited the expedition's needs. Frightening and
                  intimidating women and an elderly blind man did little to enhance the honor or the
                  reputation of men who had set a high standard of conduct for themselves and
                  others.</p>
               <p> By the second week of April, the expedition had moved farther up the Columbia and
                  was now in position for its first major river challenge—the Cascades
                  portage. That long and difficult carry was more than a dangerous trek around
                  boiling rapids. As Lewis and Clark knew, the Watlala Indians of the Cascades
                  resented the presence of any outsiders who even appeared to threaten their control
                  at this place on the river trade system. Harrassment, hostility, and petty theft
                  were all part of the toll Cascades folk extracted from all travelers. Lewis and
                  Clark were not exempt from that tariff. As the Americans labored up the north
                  shore, against swift current and over high boulders, they met Indians increasingly
                  "sulky and illy disposed." Everything pointed to a portage physically taxing and
                  emotionally trying. One false step could mean canoes and goods irretrievably lost;
                  an overreaction to Indian provocation could have fatal results.<ref target="n0903" n="03"/>
               </p>
               <p> Friday, April 11, proved the crucial day for the Cascades portage. Clark was in
                  charge of the actual portaging operation while Lewis remained at a base camp at
                  the lower end of the Cascades. The captains elected to guide empty canoes through
                  the rapids by means of ropes from the shore. Goods had to be transported over a
                  narrow, rough, and slippery path nearly three thousand yards long. Even without
                  Indian troubles, it was a demanding and nerve-racking task. No sooner had the
                  portage begun than the Watlalas commenced their delaying tactics. So many Indians
                  crowded around the base camp that several extra men had to be assigned to guard
                  duty. The harrassment increased when one particularly bold Indian began throwing
                  stones down on two men in the portage party. John Shields, who had taken some
                  extra time at the head of the Cascades to buy a dog, suddenly found himself the
                  object of the Watlalas' attention. When several Indians attempted to take his
                  future meal and push him off the portage path, Shields drew his knife in readiness
                  for something more than a polite scuffle. Seeing his determined resistence, the
                  native highwaymen fled. Even Lewis did not escape his share of trouble. Three
                  Watlalas slipped into his camp at dusk, and before he could stop them, they had
                  absconded with the dog Scannon. Absolutely furious, Lewis ordered three men to
                  give chase and use all necessary force to rescue Scannon. Gunplay was fortunately
                  avoided as the Indians released the dog when they saw armed explorers in hot
                  pursuit. Not even the reassurances of a Watlala chief that these were the
                  unsanctioned exploits of "two very bad men" and "not the wish of the nation" could
                  mollify the Americans. Lewis and Clark ordered the sentries to shoot any Indian
                  who dared steal the expedition's property. The Watlalas may have seen this all as
                  a baiting game, but an edgy Lewis did not share that view. "I am convinced," he
                  wrote, betraying both worry and belligerence, "that no other consideration but our
                  number at this moment protects us."<ref target="n0904" n="04"/>
               </p>
               <p> The following day there was less tension with Cascades natives. Guards armed with
                  short rifles perhaps convinced them that their toll price was simply too high. But
                  the rapids demanded its own fee as one American craft was caught in the current,
                  slammed against a large rock, and sank. At the end of another cold, rainy day the
                  expedition had passed the Cascades. Considering his anger earlier in the day,
                  Lewis completed the portage quietly, taking a Watlala vocabulary and carefully
                  noting some of the differences between upper and lower Chinookan dialects.<ref target="n0905" n="05"/>
               </p>
               <p> In many ways the Cascades portage was a dress rehearsal for the tensions and
                  troubles that lay ahead at The Dalles. Lewis and Clark knew from their westward
                  journey that Indians at The Dalles might prove difficult. When last at the
                  Narrows, the expedition had attracted relatively few curious Indians. Now in
                  mid-April, with the first salmon run not far off, The Dalles was crowded with
                  people. On April 15, after establishing Rock Fort Camp at the lower end of Long
                  Narrows, the explorers settled in to pursue portage and trade duties. Convinced
                  that an overland route to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> villages would save considerable time, Lewis and Clark
                  prepared to do some horse swapping. To speed that trade, it was decided that Clark
                  would set up a temporary trading post on the north side of the Columbia. Lewis
                  would remain to oversee packing and portaging operations from Rock Fort Camp.<ref target="n0906" n="06"/>
               </p>
               <p> With those decisions made, Clark took Drouillard, Charbonneau, and nine other men
                  across to the north shore. Horse trading had never been one of the expedition's
                  strengths. Despite the fact that the frontiersmen knew good horseflesh when they
                  saw it, they were usually at the mercy of native sellers who could set price and
                  supply at will. The Indians who watched Clark's party make camp showed little or
                  no interest in trade. Concerned at how poorly business was faring, Clark detailed
                  Charbonneau and Frazer to visit the Chilluckquittequaw village while Drouillard
                  and Goodrich went to the Skilloots to drum up business.<ref target="n0907" n="07"/> These ventures produced scant results. Only Drouillard returned with any
                  prospects, bringing a lame Skilloot chief who promised some trade. The chief's
                  presence produced a few nibbles at Clark's merchandise, but the high price placed
                  on horses made setting the hook nearly impossible. Faced with discouraging news,
                  Clark cautiously accepted the Skilloot chief's invitation to visit his village.
                  That night Clark's party was at the Skilloot camp. The explorers may have been
                  pleased by the sight of so many fine horses. The whine of Cruzatte's fiddle and
                  the stomp of dancing feet perhaps fostered hopes that The Dalles passage might not
                  be so trying after all. But Clark experienced other and less favorable omens that
                  night: he was bitten and chewed by "the mice and vermin with which this house
                     abounded."<ref target="n0908" n="08"/>
               </p>
               <p> Anticipation overcame the weariness of a restless night, and the next morning
                  Clark eagerly laid out his goods on a nearby rock. They had been carefully
                  packaged into individual parcels, one bundle offered for each horse. But his best
                  efforts at creative merchandising went awry. Making and then promptly breaking
                  agreements, the Indians "tenterlised" a frustrated William Clark. By the end of
                  the day, he was worn out and ready to quit the Skilloots. Only word that more
                  horses might be brought in convinced him to stay another day. And there was a
                  second and more heartening piece of news. As the Skilloot trade languished during
                  the afternoon, a chief and twenty people from the Sahaptian-speaking Eneeshur
                  village appeared and promised good horses at low prices. For a man who had
                  struggled all day to buy three horses, of which only one was a fit animal, the
                  Eneeshurs' word was indeed welcome. Encouraged or not, Clark was willing to stay
                  at the Skilloot village one more day in the hope that the winds of trade might
                     shift.<ref target="n0909" n="09"/>
               </p>
               <p> Horse trading on April 18 proved no better than on earlier days. Clark had pinned
                  his hopes on the Eneeshurs now that Skilloot sellers persisted in demanding high
                  prices. Those hopes received a sharp check early in the day when an Eneeshur party
                  arrived and, to Clark's great "estonishment," announced that all trade
                  understandings were off. Not about to give up, Clark fell back on his doctoring
                  talents to change the market climate. He offered salve for the chief's sores, gave
                  "some small things" to his children, and ministered camphor and warm flannel to
                  the ailing back of the "sulky Bitch" who was the chief's wife. Just as medical
                  skills had proved a powerful force in dealing with other Indians, Clark found the
                  Eneershurs' sales resistance lessening. But only two more horses were forthcoming.
                  At prices double what <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> traders had asked, Lewis and Clark must have wondered if the
                  expedition's corral would ever hold enough horses for the journey to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. Clark had not slept in two days; when he collapsed in
                  exhaustion at Rock Fort Camp, his timetables were falling steadily behind.<ref target="n0910" n="10"/>
               </p>
               <p> Throughout the next three days, expedition hands labored to drive packhorses and
                  haul goods over The Dalles portage. Although that effort moved slowly, it was at
                  least successful. The same could not be said for the continuing effort to swell
                  the horse herd. Clark moved his trading post to the Eneeshur village above the
                  Short Narrows and admitted that he used "every artifice decent and even false
                  statements to enduce those pore devils to sell me horses." He unsuccessfully
                  offered for each horse the full range of remaining trade items, including
                  blankets, face paint, ribbon, beads, and brass. For a sweetener, Clark threw in
                  his own large blue blanket, military coat, sword, and hat plume. All of that was
                  to no avail because the canny Eneeshurs demanded cooking kettles for horses. In an
                  outburst that revealed mounting frustration and worry, Lewis bitterly described
                  the people of The Dalles as "poor, dirty, proud, haughty, inhospitable,
                  parsimonious, and faithless in every rispect."<ref target="n0911" n="11"/>
               </p>
               <p> As incidents of petty theft and harrassment increased, Lewis and Clark struggled
                  to escape the grip of The Dalles. The last two days at the Narrows, April 21 and
                  22, held more unpleasantness with Indians than any comparable time in the history
                  of the expedition. Determined to deny the Indians even castoff items, Lewis
                  ordered canoes, poles, and paddles burned. When Lewis spotted an Indian taking one
                  of the iron sockets from a canoe pole, the captain dealt him several blows and
                  ordered the offender kicked out of camp. All the pent-up rage bred by days of
                  trouble boiled over. "I now informed the Indians that I would shoot the first of
                  them that attempted to steal an article from us; that we were not afraid to fight
                  them, that I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to
                  their houses, but it was not my wish to treat them with severity provided they
                  would let my property alone. That I would take their horses if I could find out
                  the persons who had stolen the tommahawks but that I had rather lose the property
                  altogether than take the horse of an innocent person." Just how much of this
                  speech was understood is not clear. Lewis's exercise in spleen was perhaps more an
                  index of the expedition's anxiety over homeward schedules than an overeager desire
                  to burn and kill Indians. Punching one thief and shouting some ill-considered
                  threats was not especially noble behavior, but there was sufficient provocation
                  and confusion on both sides to make Lewis's words and deeds at least
                  understandable.</p>
               <p> Clark fared no better. Stuck at the Eneeshur village until Lewis's main party
                  came up, he was surrounded by Indians who showed little regard for either his
                  mission or his comfort. The captain's day was miserable as the Eneeshurs crowded
                  around him, demanded tobacco, and made uncharitable remarks about his person.
                  Clark's sole achievement was a chance meeting with a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> man who lent him a horse and promised to guide the party on
                  their overland route to the Clearwater River.<ref target="n0912" n="12"/>

               <p> Lewis and Clark could not break free from The Dalles without one last incident.
                  On April 22, as the expedition prepared to leave its camp at the mouth of the
                  Deschutes River and begin an overland trek, Charbonneau was caught in a final
                  entanglement. The Frenchman's horse bolted, threw its rider, and ran off toward
                  one of The Dalles villages. As the horse neared the village, Charbonneau's saddle
                  and pad slid from the animal's back. The pad was evidently picked up by an Indian
                  who then denied having it. This seemed the final insult, and Lewis quickly renewed
                  his promise to put the torch to nearby mat lodges unless the robe was returned. On
                  the ragged edge of exasperation and fatigue, Lewis declared, "They have vexed me
                  in such a manner by such repeated acts of villany that I am quite disposed to
                  treat them with every severyty, their defenseless state pleads forgiveness so far
                  as respects their lives."<ref target="n0913" n="13"/> But once again the storm
                  blew over and the captain's rhetoric was not translated into reality.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> Finally beyond the reach of The Dalles, the expedition marched along the north
                  side of the Columbia through rocky, sandy country. Guided by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> who had earlier offered his services to Clark and aided by
                  the presence of an additional <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> family, the expedition headed toward the Walulas and their
                  friendly chief Yelleppit. Progress was slowed by too few packhorses and,
                  inevitably, the travelers' sore feet and twisted ankles. Such now-familiar hazards
                  were soothed when they reached the camps of the convivial Klikitats and
                     Pishquitpahs.<ref target="n0914" n="14"/> Those evenings with them were filled
                  with fiddling, dancing, and the sort of good times the explorers had not
                  experienced for a long time.</p>
               <p> Four days after slipping free from The Dalles, Lewis and Clark finally met
                  Yelleppit. Encountering the Walulas symbolized the end of the Columbia passage. It
                  also meant that the mountains were ahead, and a time with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. Yelleppit's village of fifteen large mat lodges was
                  currently on the north side of the Columbia some twelve miles below the
                  Snake-Columbia confluence. Eager to show his pleasure at seeing the Americans,
                  Yelleppit delivered a long speech enjoining his people to welcome the strangers.
                  The chief then went about gathering food and fuel to set an example of
                  hospitality. Firewood and roasted fish were valuable but even more precious was
                  information offered by the Walulas on the best way to reach the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> camps on the Clearwater.<ref target="n0915" n="15"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the westbound journey, Lewis and Clark had not been able to spend much time
                  with Yelleppit's folk but had promised to be more neighborly on the return. The
                  chief, interested in gaining a prominent place in the American trade system, was
                  not about to let that promise go unfulfilled. Early on the morning of April 28, he
                  arrived at the expedition's camp with "a very eligant white horse" as a gift for
                  Clark. Like The Dalles traders, the chief had his eye on acquiring some kettles.
                  Since the expedition was dangerously short on cooking pots, the Indian was offered
                  instead Clark's sword, one hundred rounds of ammunition, and some trade goods. If
                  the captains thought this exchange would satisfy Yelleppit and the expedition
                  might then cross the Columbia, they were mistaken.</p>
               <p> The Walula chief was not ready to let Lewis and Clark slip so easily from his
                  grasp. He was willing to provide horses, food, canoes, and information but his
                  price called for the Americans to stay in camp for at least an extra day.
                  Yelleppit artfully recalled the promise made a year ago. An extra day spent with
                  him would hardly make any difference in travel plans. Just how much the presence
                  of Lewis and Clark meant to Walula prestige became plain when Yelleppit revealed
                  that he had invited a large party of Yakimams for a grand feast and dance. Once
                  again, the explorers proved the greatest tourist attraction in western America.
                  Sensing that it would be both impolitic and impolite to disappoint Yelleppit,
                  Lewis and Clark agreed to spend a day before attempting a river crossing. Talks
                  with the Walulas were simplified by the presence of a female <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> prisoner who provided the necessary translation link between
                  Sacagawea and the Sahaptian-speaking Walulas. "We conversed with them," wrote
                  Lewis, "for several hours and fully satisfyed all their enquiries with rispect to
                  ourselves and the objects of our pursuit." Throughout the day, Clark practiced
                  medicine, "a great wonder" to the Walulas, as Ordway noted. The day ended as a
                  group of one hundred Yakimas came for an evening of dancing and singing, much of
                  it led by a Walula shaman who declared that communication with the moon spirit had
                  enabled him to predict the arrival of the Americans. In the firelight and shadow
                  of that festive night, the entire expedition may have set aside their knowledge
                  that the Lolo Trail and the Bitterroots loomed ahead.<ref target="n0916" n="16"/>
               </p>
               <p> In the last days of April, the explorers crossed the Columbia and began a
                  northeastern trek toward the Snake-Clearwater junction. They were now blessed with
                  twenty-three "excellent young horses," most of them from the Walulas. By the first
                  of May, they were along the Touchet River near present-day Waitsburg, Washington.
                  Two days later, up Pataha Creek east of present-day Pomeroy, Washington, the
                  expedition met a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> known to them as Wearkkoomt. More properly named Apash
                  Wyakaikt or Flint Necklace, he had heard that Lewis and Clark were on the way and
                  was eager to greet them. Although their journals did not mention it at the time,
                  Apash Wyakaikt had evidently gone by land ahead of the expedition in October 1805
                  to announce their arrival at the Snake-Columbia confluence. Lewis was convinced
                  that those efforts were "very instrumental in procuring us a hospitable and
                  friendly reception among those natives." Not even rain, snow, hail, and scanty
                  rations could diminish what must have been the expedition's pleasure at knowing
                  they would soon be with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> on the Clearwater.<ref target="n0917" n="17"/>
               </p>
               <p> The weather and the dog-meat rations did not improve as the explorers slowly made
                  their way toward the Clearwater. In the hard going of steep and narrow paths, men
                  and animals slipped and stumbled. One packhorse loaded with irreplaceable
                  ammunition fell into a creek, but that mysterious Lewis and Clark luck held and
                  neither horse nor load was damaged. In the afternoon of May 4, the party arrived
                  at the lodges of another <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> familiar from a year before. Tetoharsky, along with Twisted
                  Hair, had provided invaluable help on the westward voyage. From Tetoharsky's kin,
                  Lewis and Clark now learned that they should cross the Snake at this point and
                  then follow the Clearwater on the northeast side to where Twisted Hair had
                  pastured the expedition's herd of horses. Knowing that more horses were close by
                  may have improved morale, dampened by a night so cold and disagreeable that the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> huddled around Lewis and Clark's fire "in great
                  numbers insomuch that we could scarcely cook or keep ourselves warm."<ref target="n0918" n="18"/>
               </p>
               <p> On the following day, May 5, the explorers plodded along the Clearwater. Their
                  enquiries at <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> mat lodges for food found the larders nearly bare. And many
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> resented the way the strangers crowded into the
                  lodges, disregarding both etiquette and their obvious poverty. But at one of the
                  lodges Lewis and Clark found an unexpected ally. On the westbound journey, Clark
                  had done a good deal of doctoring among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. One of those he had medicated had "never ceased to extol
                  the virtues of our medicines and the skill of my friend Captain Clark as a
                  phisician." Ointments and salves now proved powerful agents as dozens of ailing
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> began to line up for consultations with "their
                  favorite phisician." Lewis doubted the efficacy of Clark's medicine chest but
                  justified "this deception for they will not give us any provision without
                  compensation in merchandize and our stock is now reduced to a mere handfull."</p>
               <p> Provisions, especially dog meat, were what the expedition desperately needed. The
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> did not usually eat dog and found it amusing that
                  the explorers relished it. That amusement very nearly sparked a serious argument
                  when a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> prankster "very impertinently" threw a scrawny
                  puppy toward Lewis. Angered by the act and the general laughter it provoked, Lewis
                  caught the dog and threw it back at the Indian "with great violence." At the same
                  time, the explorer brandished his tomahawk and made signs that if another dog grew
                  wings the Indian would suffer for it. With undisguised arrogance, Lewis recorded
                  that he then continued lunch "<hi rend="italic">on dog</hi>" without further
                  interruption.</p>
               <p> Later that afternoon, the expedition reached a large mat lodge measuring 15 by
                  156 feet. Holding thirty families, this <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> long house was home to many in the band of Neeshneparkkeook,
                  or Cutnose, who had gotten his name as the result of a wound suffered in combat
                  with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Although not especially impressed with either his
                  physique or his intelligence, Lewis and Clark gave Cutnose a small medal. Perhaps
                  more important, the explorers met a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> taken prisoner by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. With this man as translator, it was now possible to have
                  direct talks with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> without relying on signs. The first piece of information
                  that came from the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> translator was worrisome. He indicated that at least one <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> elder believed Lewis and Clark were "bad men and had come to
                  kill them." Knowing that such rumors had to be squelched, the captains were
                  pleased when Flint Necklace rejoined the party.<ref target="n0919" n="19"/>
               </p>
               <p> For the next two days, the expedition traveled east along the Clearwater. As
                  before, those were days of slim rations. Horses traded for Clark's eyewash were
                  quickly butchered. Clark also had time to record accurate descriptions of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> clothing, burial practices, and hunting techniques. But just
                  beneath that travel routine was some very disturbing news, something beyond horses
                  or diplomacy. Everyone in the party could now see that the Bitterroots were
                  covered with snow, an observation confirmed by several <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> who reported, "The snow is yet so deep on the mountains that
                  we shall not be able to pass them until after the next full moon or about the
                  first of June." Describing this as "unwelcome intiligence," Lewis admitted that
                  the diet of horsemeat and roots already had most of the expedition dreaming of
                  those "fat plains of the Missouri" and home.<ref target="n0920" n="20"/>
               </p>
               <p> It was not until the afternoon of May 8, some miles south of the Clearwater, that
                  Lewis and Clark found lodges belonging to Twisted Hair. The captains expected to
                  see not only him but horses as well. What greeted them instead was a
                  long-simmering quarrel between Twisted Hair and Cutnose. No sooner had the
                  explorers met Twisted Hair than he began to speak in a loud and angry voice.
                  Cutnose's reply was equally heated. Lewis and Clark did not immediately understand
                  the cause of the dispute but quickly realized that any delay in finding their
                  horses might be serious. Moving to cut off the argument, the captains announced
                  that they were going to march on to the first good water and bed down for the
                  night. Hoping to reconcile them, they invited both Twisted Hair and Cutnose to
                  come along.</p>
               <p> Once at their evening camp, Lewis and Clark acted to mediate between the two
                  quarrelling Indians. During the past several days, the explorers had heard rumors
                  that their horses were scattered and the saddle and tack cache damaged. Putting
                  Twisted Hair and Cutnose on good terms might clear the air and make rounding up
                  the horses much easier. Because the young <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> interpreter refused to take part in what he said was not his
                  affair, Lewis and Clark had to rely on signs to mollify both parties. After
                  Drouillard found Twisted Hair, the explorers listened first to his explanation.
                  Twisted Hair claimed that no sooner had he taken possession of the expedition's
                  horses than Cutnose and Tunnachemootoolt (Broken Arm) returned from a raid against
                  the Shoshinis. Angry and jealous of the prestige Twisted Hair had gained by his
                  association with the Americans, Cutnose and Broken Arm evidently had begun a long
                  and wearing argument with the elderly Indian. Tired and upset by their complaints,
                  Twisted Hair now admitted he had neglected the horses. Unsure how close to the
                  truth his words were but unwilling to worsen a complex situation, Lewis and Clark
                  reminded the Indian that his reward of two guns and ammunition was still available
                  if he would locate the missing horses. The captains then sent Drouillard to fetch
                  Cutnose. His story was predictably different. Cutnose charged that Twisted Hair
                  was "a bad old man" who "woar two faces." According to Cutnose, Twisted Hair had
                  allowed several young men to ride expedition horses hard enough to injure them.
                  Cutnose insisted that he and Broken Arm had tried to protect the horses, but to no
                  avail. Denied the services of their translator, Lewis and Clark could neither
                  ascertain the full truth nor resolve the quarrel. Prudence suggested staying with
                  Twisted Hair one day to allow him time to bring in the horses and then moving on
                  to Broken Arm's lodge to pay him proper due.<ref target="n0921" n="21"/>
               </p>
               <p> Letting each man tell his tale and giving at least surface credence to both was a
                  happy compromise. On the following day, Twisted Hair sent two young men to bring
                  in the expedition's horses. Although most were healthy, at least three showed
                  signs of hard use. In the afternoon, Twisted Hair and Alexander Willard went out
                  to recover saddles, tack, powder, and lead from a cache built the previous year.
                  Happily, there were signs that the row between Twisted Hair and Cutnose had become
                  a thing of the past. But against these good omens was the growing awareness that
                  the expedition would be spending more time with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> than first anticipated. Lewis and Clark's location on May 9
                  was unsuitable for a more permanent camp. Access to water, good pasture, and
                  protection against weather and theft all required finding another site.</p>
               <p> That the expedition had left Fort Clatsop too soon became painfully evident when
                  the explorers set out on May 10 for Broken Arm's village. With eight inches of
                  snow on the ground, horses slipped repeatedly along the hazardous trail. It was
                  not until late in the afternoon that Lewis and Clark finally came down to Lawyer's
                  Canon Creek and straggled into the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> settlement. Greeting them were an impressive <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chief and his people, framed by a large mat lodge and an
                  American flag left behind the previous year. Cold and hungry, Lewis and Clark
                  asked Broken Arm's help to restock the expedition's supplies. The chief responded
                  by bringing roots and dried salmon, food that stirred memoires of agonizing
                  indigestion and dysentery. He then graciously promised as many horses as needed
                  for fresh meat.</p>
               <p> While all this menu-planning was going on, the stage was being set for
                  preliminary talks with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. Those councils moved a step closer when an important chief
                  Lewis and Clark called Hohastillpilp arrived at Broken Arm's village with a party
                  of fifty mounted warriors. More properly known as Hohots Ilppilp or the Bloody
                  Chief, his village was some six miles away near the Clearwater. With Broken Arm,
                  Cutnose, and Hohots Ilppilp present, Lewis and Clark decided to begin serious
                  talks. Broken Arm and Hohots Ilppilp were first given medals. Using their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> interpreter, the explorers explained "the design and the
                  importance of medals in the estimation of the whites as well as the red men who
                  had been taught their value." Impressed by all this, and with his eye on gaining
                  things more precious than medals, Broken Arm led the explorers to a council tepee.
                  With a crowd of Indians packed into the lodge, everyone spent the rest of the
                  evening eating prime horsemeat, smoking friendly pipes, and talking in a mixture
                  of phrases and signs that were hastily translated. This council seemed to promise
                  the kind of diplomatic success that had so often eluded Lewis and Clark.<ref target="n0922" n="22"/>
               </p>
               <p> Early talks with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> chiefs prepared the way for two days of serious diplomatic
                  exchange on May 11 and 12. If Lewis and Clark were unsure of their agenda at Fort
                  Clatsop, they were more certain of their negotiating priorities with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> and other plateau peoples. Participation in the American
                  trade system, intertribal peace, and delegations of notables destined for the
                  president's reception room were all on the list of subjects to be broached with
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>. It was an agenda that Lewis and Clark believed
                  applicable to every native group. That such diplomacy—especially the
                  dangerous practice of promising arms to traditional enemies—might have
                  unforeseen and unpleasant consequences had not yet become plain to the Corps of
                  Discovery diplomats.</p>
               <p> With the arrival of Yoomparkkartim (Five Big Hearts), "a chief of great note,"
                  all major <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> headmen in the immediate area were present. Lewis
                  and Clark never lacked a flair for the dramatic, no matter how understated their
                  journal entries. Borrowing from native cartographic techniques, the captains began
                  the grand council by drawing a map of the country with charcoal on a stretched
                  hide. Smoking, gift-giving, and the mapping revealed just how much the explorers
                  had learned of Indian protocol. If past experience proved any guide, Lewis was
                  responsible for making the formal presentation. Although his remarks were short
                  and uncomplicated, translations proved "tedious" as every word passed through
                  English, French, Hidatsa, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>, and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> speakers. Half the day was taken up getting Lewis's message
                  across to the patient chiefs. The American officer presented four closely related
                  points. Establishing trading posts, instituting intertribal peace, and preparing
                  delegations were a trio of themes that had been repeated since the earliest days
                  on the Missouri. The issue of American sovereignty was an unspoken part of the
                  talks, although what had been said the previous day about the design and meaning
                  of medals suggests that thoughts of sovereignty were not far from the Americans'
                  minds. But there was a final point in Lewis's presentation that was both spoken
                  and demonstrated. Throughout their long voyage Lewis and Clark were always at
                  pains to show as forcefully as possible the military prowess and technological
                  strength of the new republic. Parades, keelboat curiosities, telescopes, mirrors,
                  and the omnipresent airgun were all for that purpose. "After the council was
                  over," wrote Lewis, "we amused ourselves with showing them the power of magnatism,
                  the spy glass, compass, watch, air gun and sundry other articles equally novel and
                  incomprehensible to them." When one young and important warrior told the captains
                  that he had "opened his ears to our councils and that our words had made his heart
                  glad," Lewis and Clark must have believed that a major diplomatic victory was in
                  the offing.<ref target="n0923" n="23"/>
               </p>
               <p> The captains understood enough Indian political and diplomatic practice to
                  realize that no immediate answer to the American plans could be expected. There
                  had to be time for talk and a ceremonial acceptance of a consensus that was
                  ultimately binding on none. Throughout the morning of Monday, May 12, chiefs and
                  elders spoke their minds in a council that eventually proved to have far-reaching
                  consequences for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> people. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> leaders assembled at Broken Arm's village certainly
                  understood what was at stake. By 1806 there were about four thousand <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> living in several autonomous bands. The predictable rhythms
                  of their lives were increasingly challenged by the flood of firearms falling into
                  the hands of Blackfeet and Atsina warriors. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> situation was similar to that of Cameahwait's Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Both peoples desperately needed a place in the American
                  trade system, if only to obtain guns and ammunition. In a plains and plateau world
                  undergoing profound change, links to American traders promised what must have
                  seemed cheap security. Several hours of talk behind him, Broken Arm emerged and
                  set in motion one of the most dramatic moments in expedition history. Taking flour
                  made from cous roots, the chief made a thick mush and then ladled it into "the
                  kettles and baskets of all his people." After a long speech in which he explained
                  the decisions reached in council, Broken Arm called on all who accepted those
                  decisions to eat the mush. In a colorful line, Lewis observed, "All swallowed
                  their objections if any they had very cheerfully with their mush." This was done
                  to a background of women crying and tearing their hair, perhaps sensing that links
                  with the strangers might bring unequal measures of safety and danger.</p>
               <p> With ritual acceptance of the council's decisions, it was time for the Indians to
                  present formally their views to Lewis and Clark. Because so many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> required medical attention, the captains decided that Clark
                  would spend the rest of the day doctoring while Lewis pursued his diplomacy. The
                  official orator for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> was the elderly father of Hohots Ilppilp, a man of
                  considerable prestige and political skill. Declaring that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> now spoke with one heart and one mind, the old speaker
                  presented a perceptive, critical evaluation of American proposals and native
                  needs. He agreed that peace with neighboring tribes had real advantages. As if to
                  underscore the unity of American and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> policies, he reported that in the summer of 1805 a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> delegation had gone to parley with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> along the Snake River. But those emissaries had been killed
                  by <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> warriors and the resulting raid against the Snake
                  River people had counted forty-two <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> dead and only three <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> casualties. The blood of the slain peacemakers had been
                  properly revenged and peace was now possible. But whether the old man meant peace
                  as Lewis and Clark understood it or a temporary truce remained unclear. As they
                  had along the Missouri, the explorer-diplomats unthinkingly assumed that "peace"
                  meant the same thing on both sides of the cultural divide.</p>
               <p> As the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> leadership understood it, the real issue was trade
                  and security. Access to guns symbolized their concern. Speaking to that complex
                  matter, the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> orator declared that his people were willing to travel on to
                  the Missouri plains for trade. However, no <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> was prepared to make such a trading journey unless there were
                  solid assurances that Blackfeet and Atsina warriors were not lying in ambush along
                  the trail. All of this meant arming the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> and making peace with those plains warriors already well
                  armed by Canadian traders. That these two objectives were mutually exclusive may
                  have been evident to some <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> but not to Lewis and Clark. The old speaker pledged
                  everlasting friendship to the Americans, saying that although the bands were poor,
                  "their hearts were good." There may have been plenty of "good hearts" in evidence,
                  but what the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> really wanted were guns. As for a delegation to the Federal
                  City, that issue was unresolved. If the Americans could deliver weapons, then
                  perhaps a long journey to see the chief of the seventeen fires would be worth the
                  trouble and danger.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's fullest day of diplomacy since talks with Cameahwait ended with
                  a flurry of eating, singing, dancing, and gambling. Pipes were passed, more
                  gifts-exchanged, and Clark continued his medical ministrations. But in all this
                  play and good feeling, there was one activity that especially fascinated many
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> warriors. Firing rifles at targets drew their
                  attention. The presence of native visitors on the weapons range was a clear
                  indication of what lay behind so much of the talk during that day. When Lewis
                  struck the mark twice from a range of 220 yards, those warriors could not help but
                  be impressed with the weapons that might soon be in their hands.<ref target="n0924" n="24"/>

            <div type="section">
               <p> Lewis and Clark believed that their major diplomatic objectives with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> had been accomplished. After the talks, they were
                  increasingly concerned with the problem of deep snows in the Bitterroots. During
                  the grand council, there were further reports that the Lolo Trail would not be
                  passable for at least another month. Any hope of a quick passage over the
                  mountains was now gone. A site had to be found for a camp among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, and arrangements had to be made for guides once the trail
                  was open. Lewis and Clark hoped that by inviting Twisted Hair's family to live
                  nearby, guides from his household might be hired. Following suggestions from
                  several chiefs, they located a camping place along the north bank of the
                  Clearwater River near modern-day Kamiah, Idaho. This was an especially favorable
                  site, providing access to good hunting grounds, fine pasture for horses, and the
                  river when the salmon finally ran. The expedition's baggage was stored in the
                  center of a depression made by an abandoned winter pit lodge. Although the
                  expedition spent nearly a month (May 14–June 10, 1806) at this spot, Lewis
                  and Clark never gave the camp a formal name. Tradition has called it Camp
                  Chopunnish, Long Camp, or Camp Kamiah. Clark placed his seal of approval on the
                  location by declaring himself "perfectly satisfied with our position."<ref target="n0925" n="25"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although Camp Chopunnish was never much more than a collection of leaky brush
                  wickiups, luggage pens, and a makeshift horse corral, it was the center of busy
                  activity. Day by day there were more Indians who found a welcome at Camp
                  Chopunnish than at Fort Clatsop. Contacts with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> ranged from trade and medicine to sport and sex. As they
                  waited for snows to melt up in the Bitterroots, members of the expedition
                  developed close ties with these Indians.</p>
               <p> Despite the best efforts of expeditionary hunters led by George Drouillard, it
                  was plain by early May that a reliable trade in foodstuffs had to be established
                  with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> villages. It was this trade that most often
                  provided common ground for explorer and Indian. What to offer for stocks of camas
                  and cous roots and the much-sought-after cous bread proved a serious problem.
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> tastes in trade goods did not run to "baubles," as
                  Lewis called them. Beads, armbands, and other luxury items failed to attract much
                  attention. The practical <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> sought knives, kettles, blankets, and moccasin awls. But the
                  expedition's supplies of those tools and utensils were short, and if Lewis and
                  Clark hoped to foster a dependable trade, canny substitutions had to be found.<ref target="n0926" n="26"/>
               </p>
               <p> By mid-May, as the expedition's hunting fortunes further declined, Lewis and
                  Clark organized trading parties to visit the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> villages. Typical of those ventures was the first mission to
                  Broken Arm's village. Toussaint Charbonneau, John Thompson, Peter Wiser, John
                  Potts, and Hugh Hall were given moccasin awls, knitting pins, and brass armbands
                  to exchange for cous roots and bread. After a day of haggling, "our marketers"
                  returned near dark with six bushels of roots and bread. On May 20, Frazer was sent
                  on the second trade foray. He reported that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were apparently ready to depart from their usual utilitarian
                  demands and might be wooed with brass uniform buttons. Buttons promptly vanished
                  from the expedition's clothing as each man gathered what he could to make trade
                  bargains. Lewis and Clark evidently feared that such a scramble might produce
                  economic chaos and reduced morale. On May 21, the captains collected all the
                  remaining goods and carefully parceled them out to each man. Every member of the
                  Corps of Discovery was given one awl, one knitting pin, half an ounce of vermilion
                  paint, two needles, a few skeins of thread, and one yard of ribbon. With this
                  "slender stock," each man was to make any agreements he could to obtain the food
                  necessary for the Lolo Trail passage.<ref target="n0927" n="27"/>

               <p> In the last days of May, small expedition parties made regular trips to Indian
                  camps along the Clearwater. Trading was often difficult as <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> folk soon learned that the laws of supply and demand favored
                  them. Gass admitted that roots and bread could only be bought "at a very dear
                  rate." Hardpressed to meet <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> business demands, some men ingeniously fashioned moccasin
                  awls from small links of a discarded chain. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> trade was not only difficult but dangerous as well. When
                  Charbonneau and Jean Baptiste Lepage went up the Clearwater to trade at a village
                  some eight miles away, they experienced, in Lewis's words, "a broken voyage."
                  Things began to go wrong for the two French traders when their packhorse slipped
                  and fell into the Clearwater. Terrified, the horse bolted and swam across the
                  river. An Indian on the opposite shore helpfully tried to drive the horse back
                  toward the traders, but the pack cinches broke and precious cargo was lost. And to
                  compound troubles, a raft loaded with roots destined for Charbonneau and Lapage
                  struck a rock and capsized. "The river having fallen heir to both merchandize and
                  roots," wrote Lewis laconically, "our traders returned with empty hands." The
                  troubles experienced by Potts, Shannon, and John Collins were far more serious.
                  While attempting to cross the Clearwater, their canoe caught the full force of the
                  current and slammed into a tree. Potts was "an indifferent swimmer"; as he
                  floundered in the river, the canoe quickly filled with water and sank. In the
                  confusion three blankets, one blanket coat, and a supply of trade goods were lost.
                  Efforts by Pryor and his men to raise the canoe and recover the goods failed. The
                  loss of the blankets was indeed serious. As Gass explained, "The loss of these
                  blankets is the greatest which hath happened to any individual since we began our
                  voyage, as there are only three men in the party who have more than one blanket
                     apiece."<ref target="n0928" n="28"/>
               </p>
               <p> By the first days of June, the expedition's stocks of trade items were nearly
                  gone. High prices, accidents, and continued poor hunting made business with the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> increasingly difficult and jeopardized the
                  explorers along the Lolo Trail. "Having exhausted all our merchandize," wrote
                  Lewis, "we are obliged to have recourse to every subterfuge in order to prepare in
                  the most ample manner in our power to meet that wretched portion of our journey,
                  the Rocky Mountains, where hungar and cold in their most rigorous forms assail the
                  wearied traveller." Whether those "subterfuges" were the same as the tricks of
                  trade employed by Clark along the Columbia is not plain in the journals. What is
                  recorded is a desperate effort to find any objects that might attract the Indians'
                  attention. Lewis and Clark cut the buttons from their own coats and made up
                  measures of several medications. Those goods, along with some unused phials and
                  tin boxes, were given to McNeal and York. When the two men returned bringing three
                  bushels of roots and some cous bread, their success was "not much less pleasing to
                  us than the return of a good cargo to an East India Merchant."<ref target="n0929" n="29"/> Less successful was a long trip undertaken by Ordway, Frazer, and
                  Wiser to an Indian fishery at Wild Goose Rapids on the Snake River to trade for
                  salmon. After a journey that lasted a week and covered some one hundred miles,
                  Ordway's party returned with seventeen spoiled fish and a few cous roots.<ref target="n0930" n="30"/>
               </p>
               <p> Throughout the first week of June, Lewis and Clark continued to pursue the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> trade. Believing that snows would be sufficiently melted
                  within the next two weeks, the explorers redoubled their efforts to stockpile food
                  for the mountain passage. But these efforts were hampered by few goods for trade
                  and the failure of salmon to run on the Clearwater. Nothing could be done about
                  the tardy fish, but many men in the party used considerable imagination to create
                  "little notions" from bits and pieces of worn files, spare bullets, and tattered
                  fish nets. These ventures in product design evidently paid off, much to Lewis and
                  Clark's surprise. The captains, who had been so pessimistic a few days before,
                  found that by June 6 the Corps had enough rations to dare the Lolo Trail.<ref target="n0931" n="31"/> The remaining trade centered on obtaining ropes for
                  packsaddles, skin bags to hold provisions, and animal hair for saddle pads.</p>
               <p> That the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> continued to have "good hearts" toward their Camp
                  Chopunnish neighbors was the result of two expectations. Hope that ties to the
                  Americans might bring a steady supply of trade goods, especially guns and
                  ammunition, and some lessening of tensions with plains raiders clearly shaped the
                  Indians' behavior. Only slightly less important for expedition–<ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> relations were the medical services Clark provided to
                  countless Indian men, women, and children. Just how interested the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were in his doctoring was evident even before Camp
                  Chopunnish was established. As Clark explained it, cures accomplished during the
                  westbound journey "raised my reputation and gives those nativs an exolted oppinion
                  of my skill a a phisician." Quickly realizing that much of their future comfort
                  and security depended on <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> good will, the explorers were willing to continue the
                  "deception" of Clark as the great healer. But Clark was not without scruples, and
                  he maintained: "We take care to give them no article which can possibly injure
                  them, and in many cases can administer and give such medicine and sirgical aid as
                  will effectually restore them in simple cases."<ref target="n0932" n="32"/>
               </p>
               <p> As the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>' "favorite phisician," Clark had a waiting room
                  filled with eager patients. Throughout the days at Camp Chopunnish, he saw a wide
                  variety of diseases and disorders. Most common were sore eyes, rheumatism,
                  strained muscles, and abrasions. But there were also more demanding medical
                  problems, including serious abscesses, mental depression, and "disorders intirely
                  out of the power of Medison." Determined to do what he could for those "poor
                  afflicted wretches," Clark utilized simple medications and common-sense therapies.
                  Those included various salves, elixirs, pills, and large quantities of eyewash.
                  Laudanum (tincture of opium) was the most potent drug in the expedition's medicine
                  chest. Clark also administered back rubs and on at least one occasion performed
                  minor surgery on festering abscess. The fact that a party of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> once spent two days in the saddle to obtain some of Clark's
                  famous eyewash is a reminder of how important his medical services were at Camp
                     Chopunnish.<ref target="n0933" n="33"/>
               </p>
               <p> Of all the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> cases seen by Clark, none was more dramatic or as
                  well-documented as that of a paralyzed chief. This unnamed "chief of considerable
                  note" first appeared at camp on May 11. With Clinical precision, Lewis and Clark
                  described the Indian's symptoms and speculated on the cause of his apparent
                  paralysis. "This man is incapable of moveing a single limb but lies like a corps
                  in whatever position he is placed, yet he eats hartily, dejests his food
                  perfectly, enjoys his understanding. His pulse are good, and has retained his
                  flesh almost perfectly; in short were it not that he appears a little pale from
                  having been so long in the shade, he might well be taken for a man in good health.
                  I suspect that their confinement to a diet of roots may give rise to all the
                  disorders of the nativs of this quarter except the Rhumitsism and Sore eyes, and
                  to the latter of those, the state of debility incident to a vegitable diet may
                  measureable contribute." Although betraying a cultural preference for red meat in
                  the diet, in every other way the diagnosis represents a skillful piece of
                  physiological observation.<ref target="n0934" n="34"/>
               </p>
               <p> With this case Lewis and Clark learned the difference between successful
                  diagnosis and effective therapy. The explorers were especially eager to provide
                  good care for the chief. Success in treatment would further insure <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> hospitality and support. But in a case as complex as this,
                  they were quite unsure how to proceed. Notions about diet as the root cause of the
                  man's immobility offered slight guidance for a condition that had already lasted
                  five years. Clark first prescribed "simple cooling medicenes" for the chief. When
                  these failed and the chief's relatives persisted in hoping for a cure, he gave
                  several doses of sulphur and cream of tartar and proposed a regimen of daily cold
                  baths. But in all of this Clark admitted that he was at a loss to deturmine what
                  to do for this unfortunate man." In desperation, he suggested a few drops of
                  laudanum and the expedition's version of chicken soup, a watery broth made from
                  portable soup.<ref target="n0935" n="35"/>
               </p>
               <p> A breakthrough of sorts came on May 24. After giving a powerful sweat bath to
                  chronically ill William Bratton and seeing its positive results, the captains
                  decided to try the treatment on the chief. But the sweating hole dug for Bratton
                  proved too small for the chief. Stymied but not ready to admit defeat, Lewis and
                  Clark urged relatives to take the chief to their larger sweat lodges. And
                  reflecting current medical interest in the possible healing effects of
                  electricity, Lewis declared that the chief "would be an excellent subject for
                  electricity" and regretted that "I have it not in my power to supply it."<ref target="n0936" n="36"/>
               </p>
               <p> Clark may have thought that, after his failure to sweat the chief, his advice to
                  the anxious family might end the expedition's involvement. But Clark's reputation
                  was too powerful for that, and when both patient and family lingered in camp, he
                  was compelled to once again prescribe sulphur and cream of tartar and urge that
                  the stricken chief be be taken home. When the latter suggestion was strongly
                  resisted, it was agreed to attempt a second sweat. On the following day, May 27,
                  the chief's father carefully enlarged the sweat pit. The man was then lowered into
                  the pit with ropes and, despite considerable pain, the therapy seemed
                  promising.</p>
               <p> In the days that followed, the heat treatments were repeated. To the surprise of
                  all, the chief gradually recovered use of his arms and hands. By the end of May,
                  the man was washing his face and was able to move his toes and legs. As the
                  expedition prepared to leave Camp Chopunnish in early June, the chief continued to
                  report progress. Whether his improvement was sustained is not known, but the
                  efforts of Lewis and Clark in this difficult case reenforced the positive image of
                  the explorers in the minds of many <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>.<ref target="n0937" n="37"/>
               </p>
               <p> Busy with trade, medicine, and the demands of daily life, Lewis and Clark still
                  found time to record something about the lives of their Indian hosts. As had
                  become the rule in their ethnography, the explorers paid most attention to <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> material culture. In references scattered throughout the Camp
                  Chopunnish entries, Lewis and Clark commented on a variety of topics. Eating
                  habits, domestic architecture, hunting techniques, and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> passion for fine horses all found a place in their records.
                  Clothing, saddles, and weapons were duly noted and described. Attitudes about old
                  age, the protocol of diplomacy, and the custom of sacrificing horses at the death
                  of a prominent person made the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> come alive in the journals. And the explorers took time to
                  set down one vivid aural impression of native life. "The noise of their women
                  pounding roots reminds me of a nail factory," wrote Lewis.<ref target="n0938" n="38"/>
               </p>
               <p> Camp Chopunnish was second only to Fort Mandan as a place where Indians and
                  explorers could enjoy each other's company. Although records for this period are
                  neither as full nor as explicit as those kept at Fort Mandan, there is evidence
                  strongly suggesting that the Americans stood "at ease" among the Clearwater
                  people. Finding much to admire in <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> customs, hospitality, and physique, Lewis and Clark felt
                  comfortable enough to relax and enjoy some breathing time before assaulting the
                  dreaded Lolo Trail. There were times for fiddling, dancing, and singing. On
                  several occasions, the expedition's hunters shared meat with hungry Indians. In
                  return, the natives showed the Americans a remarkably infection-free method for
                  gelding horses. Even at Fort Mandan there had been bumps and scrapes in
                  Indian-expedition relations. But if such troubles drifted into Camp Chopunnish,
                  they were so minor as to elude all journal keepers.<ref target="n0939" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p> Even more elusive are the facts about sexual relations between men in the
                  expedition and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> women. Among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, there were no strong sanctions for or against sex with
                  whites. These plateau people used sex neither to seal trade bargains nor to gain
                  spiritual power. The expedition's records during the winters with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and the Clatsops are filled with the pleasures and troubles of
                  native affairs. But the Camp Chopunnish entries in all journals are oddly silent
                  on what was from the beginning an accepted part of the life of the expedition.
                  There seems little doubt that contacts more intimate than trading for roots took
                  place during those early spring days. Sex usually made for good copy in the
                  journals when it involved disease, personal trouble, or cultural misunderstanding.
                  Since relations with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were amiable, whatever personal encounters took place may
                  well have been mutually satisfactory.</p>
               <p> Perhaps the most intriguing piece of evidence to suggest the presence of such
                  liaisons is a photograph taken by the noted western cameraman William H. Jackson.
                  Before the 1877 <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> War, Jackson encountered a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> band and was introduced to a blue-eyed, sandy-haired man
                  claiming to be William Clark's son. Sufficiently impressed, Jackson photographed
                  the man. The assertion that Clark left a son behind along the Clearwater
                  persisted, and when Chief Joseph's band surrendered to General Nelson Miles in
                  1877, one of the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> prisoners was pointed out as Clark's son. Although in no way
                  conclusive, the story does reveal the continued positive reputation of Lewis and
                  Clark among the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> well into the nineteenth century. Whether this particular
                  man was indeed Clark's son or the child of another white explorer is beyond the
                  power of existing historical evidence either to verify or deny. At the same time,
                  the persistence of the tale hints at one more part of the physical life at Camp
                     Chopunnish.<ref target="n0940" n="40"/>
               </p>
               <p> Far less difficult to document were times of boisterous fun and athletic
                  competition in what might be aptly described as the Camp Chopunnish Olympics. The
                  men of the expedition had been selected, at least in part, for their sound
                  constitutions. Despite long months of travel and often irregular diets, most
                  remained in good condition. Their frontier and military backgrounds were filled
                  with demanding physical conditioning as well as a tradition of competitive sports.
                  The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> men equally admired strong bodies and tests of
                  skill and strength. Early in June, as the expedition prepared to leave camp, the
                  explorers and Indians staged an impromptu series of athletic contests. There had
                  already been some target shooting, and now foot races were added to the schedule.
                  Matched against a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> team that Lewis admitted was "very active" were sprinters
                  George Drouillard and Reuben Field. But Indian runners proved very swift, and at
                  least one was as fast as the best the Corps of Discovery had to offer. Following
                  the races was a game Lewis and Clark described as "prison base," an activity much
                  like "keep away" or "running bases." These good-natured competitions provided yet
                  another chance for all in camp to enjoy simple pleasures. For the captains there
                  was an additional benefit. As Lewis explained it, with the mountain crossing
                  drawing near, those men who had become "rather lazy and slouthfull" needed some
                  rigorous exercise.<ref target="n0941" n="41"/>
               </p>
               <p> As May slipped into June and the time grew closer to leave Camp Chopunnish, there
                  were several diplomatic questions still unanswered. Although Lewis and Clark
                  certainly believed that most of the American proposals had been accepted, some
                  issues had not yet received formal <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> replies. Those included the expedition's requests for guides
                  beyond the mountains, a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> group to accompany Lewis at least partway in his journey to
                  negotiate with Atsina and Blackfeet bands, and a delegation to visit President
                  Jefferson.</p>
               <p> On June 4, as Broken Arm and several other chiefs prepared to leave for their own
                  villages, Lewis and Clark reminded them of earlier promises to aid the expedition.
                  The chiefs' reply revealed not so much second thoughts about an American trade and
                  military alliance as some caution about the powers and abilities of untested new
                  friends. Broken Arm carefully declined the invitation for some young warriors to
                  accompany Lewis beyond Travelers' Rest, declaring that his hunters would not
                  venture beyond the Bitterroots until late in the summer. He hinted that there was
                  little hope for a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> delegation to go with Lewis. Although none of the chief's
                  replies spelled defeat for American diplomacy, they did reveal a certain prudent
                  wariness. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> wanted American guns and the security they promised, but
                  there were always those cries of fearful women to counsel caution.<ref target="n0942" n="42"/>
               </p>
               <p> Not about to accept Broken Arm's words as a final answer, the captains decided to
                  send Clark and a small party to parley once again with the chief. Receiving the
                  Americans with unfailing hospitality, Broken Arm told Clark of the presence of
                  many headmen from small and more distant villages who had not been at the grand
                  council in early May. Broken Arm had thoughtfully invited them and now asked Clark
                  to repeat to them the American plans. If Clark hoped that a larger audience and a
                  second chance to explain federal policy might change some minds, he was wrong.
                  Broken Arm repeated what he had said two days before: no large number of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> were about to accompany the expedition. The request for some
                  warrior-diplomats to foster intertribal peace on the Marias could not be decided
                  until a larger council met.</p>
               <p> But Broken Arm did not want Clark to think the whole notion of peace with
                  neighbors was now in doubt. The chief explained that, as a result of recent
                  contacts with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> who desired peace with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> and Cayuse bands, a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> delegation had been sent toward the Snake River to negotiate
                  such an agreement. Broken Arm promised he would never break that peace and to
                  emphasize his good intentions presented Clark two ceremonial pipes—one a
                  traditional <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> pipe for the explorers and the other a fancy plains pipe with
                  silver inlays for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>. Knowing the significance of those pipes, Clark decorated the
                  one destined for the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> with blue ribbon and white wampum to symbolize a mutual
                  desire for peace. As he made his way back to camp, Clark may well have noted that,
                  although American policy now seemed on firmer ground, the immediate need for
                  guides over the treacherous Lolo Trail was yet unmet.<ref target="n0943" n="43"/>

            <div type="section">
               <p> From the first days at Camp Chopunnish, Lewis and Clark had maintained a close
                  watch on snow conditions in the Bitterroots. The expedition's timetables called
                  for a quick journey over the mountains. A long stay with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, no matter how pleasant, seriously endangered the homeward
                  voyage. By the middle of May, both captains were looking for any sign to prove
                  that the Lolo Trail would soon be passable. Clark reported: "I frequently consult
                  the nativs on the subject of passing this tremendious barrier whic now present
                  themselves to our view." Lewis anxiously eyed the level of the Clearwater River
                  for some hint that snows were melting. In a moment of frustration, he lashed out
                  at "that icy barrier which seperates me from my friends and Country, from all
                  which makes life esteemable—patience, patience." Lewis might well have
                  counseled patience for himself and the whole party. Both <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> and expedition hunters reported deep snows that might not
                  melt until at least mid-June.<ref target="n0944" n="44"/>
               </p>
               <p> As mid-June approached, the entire expedition busied itself preparing for the
                  Lolo assault. By June 6, Lewis and Clark felt certain that their food stocks were
                  sufficient to meet any challenge on the trail. But two days later, all those hopes
                  and plans suffered an unexpected setback. A <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> reported that the trail beyond Weippe Prairie was still so
                  deep with snow that any passage during June was courting disaster. As the Indian
                  explained, "If we attempted it sooner our horses would be at least three days
                  travel without food on the top of the mountain." Lewis admitted, "This information
                  is disagreeable inasmuch as it causes some doubt as to the time at which it will
                  be proper for us to set out." A hurried and anguished meeting to discuss tactics
                  must have followed that unwelcome <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> road report. When Lewis and Clark had held a similar talk in
                  early June 1805 to decide whether the Marias River was the true Missouri channel,
                  they had made the right choice. But in a rush to get home, and increasingly
                  fearful of delay, the captains now blundered into the wrong decision. "As we have
                  no time to loose we will wrisk the chanches and set out as early as the Indians
                  generally think practicable or the middle of this month." Risking the chances was
                  dangerous enough; without Indian guides, the expedition was moving toward a
                  rendezvous with the Lolo that not even the old Lewis and Clark luck could
                     overcome.<ref target="n0945" n="45"/>
               </p>
               <p> The decision to leave Camp Chopunnish against Indian advice and without guides
                  was dead wrong, but it was very popular with the rank and file in the Corps of
                  Discovery. Lewis insisted that "our party seem much elated with the idea of moving
                  on towards their friends and Country, they all seem alirt in their movements
                  today." But as the day of departure approached, both captains began to have second
                  thoughts. "Even now," said Clark, "I shudder with the expectation [of] great
                  difficuelties in passing those Mountains." Lewis was typically more explicit in
                  his appraisal of the situation. <quote> I am still apprehensive that the snow and
                     the want of food for our horses will prove a serious imbarrassment to us as at
                     least four days journey of our rout in these mountains lies over hights and
                     along a ledge of mountains never intirely distititue of snow. Every body seems
                     anxious to be in motion, convinced that we have not now any time to delay if
                     the calculation is to reach the United States this season; this I am detirmined
                     to accomplish if within the compass of human power.<ref target="n0946" n="46"/>
                  </quote> That determination now brought Lewis and Clark to risk their chances on
                  what all remembered as a harsh, unforgiving trail.</p>
               <p> On June 15, the explorers rode from Camp Chopunnish to Weippe Prairie. Even that
                  reasonably easy path proved hazardous as spring rains made the ground slippery.
                  Fallen timber blocked much of the route and Lewis was forced to concede that "our
                  march [was] slow and extreemly laborious." On the following day, as the expedition
                  moved to higher elevations, the full impact of snowy conditions on the trail
                  became plain. Although the Lolo vanished in deep snow, the expedition was
                  determined to press on. But even Lewis began to question such foolhardy valor, and
                  at the end of an exhausting day wrote that the Bitterroot snow "augers but
                  unfavorably with rispect to the practicability of passing the mountains."<ref target="n0947" n="47"/>
               </p>
               <p> June 17 proved a day of decision and defeat. Floundering in drifts sometimes
                  twelve to fifteen feet deep, each member of the party musth have recalled those
                  terrible days of September 1805 when it seemed the Lolo would be a cold grave.
                  With men near exhaustion and horses unable to breast the drifts, Lewis and Clark
                  held another hurried conference. Lewis made the choices and chances painfully
                  clear. "If we proceeded and should get bewildered in these mountains the certainty
                  was that we should loose all our horses and consequently our baggage, instruments
                  perhaps our papers and thus eminently wrisk the loss of the discoveries which we
                  had already made if we should be so fortunate as to escape with life." The needed
                  on the compass of human power had swung about and now counseled retreat. Bested by
                  the bitter snows, the expedition "a good deel dejected" turned around and headed
                  back toward Weippe Prairie, there to wait for Indian guides hired by Drouillard
                  and Shannon. Patrick Gass caught the mood at the end of the day when he wrote that
                  most in the party were "melancholy and disappointed." Camping that night in a
                  chill rain that edged toward sleet, Lewis could only recall, "This is the first
                  time since we have been on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to
                  retreat or make a retrograde march."<ref target="n0948" n="48"/>
               </p>
               <p> After the difficult and depressing trek back to Weippe Prairie, the expedition's
                  fortunes took an upward turn. Drouillard brought three <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides into camp. In return for guns and ammunition, these
                  men promised to direct the explorers at least as far as Travelers' Rest. Lewis and
                  Clark were told that a peace had been arranged between <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref>, Walula, and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> bands. But news about fresh engagements with Atsina warriors
                  was troubling. The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides claimed that hostile raiders had recently killed many
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref>. Those deaths added both danger and urgency to Lewis's
                  diplomacy on the Marias.<ref target="n0949" n="49"/>
               </p>
               <p> Led by experienced <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, the expedition made a safe and swift passage over those
                  tremendous mountains. By June 29 the explorers were at the Lolo Hot Springs
                  enjoying the recuperative powers of steaming water on aching muscles and bruised
                  feet. Once at Travelers' Rest on July 1, Lewis and Clark put the final touches on
                  an intricate plan that promised to fulfill many of their objectives and test their
                  field skills.</p>
               <p> The captains "consurted" the following strategy. Lewis would take a small party
                  overland to the Great Falls of the Missouri "by the most direct route." Privates
                  Thompson, Goodrich, and McNeal would remain at the falls to retrieve and refurbish
                  equipment cached in 1805. In the meantime, Lewis would take a handful of
                  volunteers up the Marias River to chart its northern course, explore the country,
                  and contact the Blackfeet and Atsina Indians. After that dangerous reconnaissance,
                  Lewis hoped to rejoin the Great Falls detachment on the Missouri for a grand
                  reunion with Clark's party at the mouth of the Yellowstone.</p>
               <p> Although Lewis's Blackfeet adventure on the Two Medicine River was more dramatic
                  than anything Clark undertook, Clark's assignment was every bit as important. He
                  was to proceed south from Travelers' Rest through the Bitterroot Valley and
                  eventually cross the Great Divide to Three Forks. At the forks, Clark planned to
                  take his party overland to find the Yellowstone and explore its course to the
                  Missouri. At the same time, a group under Ordway would travel by canoe from Three
                  Forks to Great Falls for a linkup with the men left by Lewis. Eventually the whole
                  Corps of Discovery would reassemble at the Yellowstone-Missouri confluence.<ref target="n0950" n="50"/>
               </p>
               <p> One last detail remained to be done that day at Travelers' Rest. Thinking about
                  the complex diplomacy ahead with Missouri River villagers and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> bands, Lewis and Clark decided that the Nor'Wester Hugh Heney
                  might prove a valuable ally in the struggle either to win or to cow the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. In a long letter to Heney, the explorers offered him the office
                  of Indian agent. More specifically, the captains wanted the trader to use his
                  influence to wean <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> chiefs away from British merchants like Murdoch Cameron and bring
                  them into the St. Louis trade system. At the same time, they hoped Heney could
                  organize a delegation of chiefs and elders for a journey to Washington. Reflecting
                  Lewis's ideas on American trade along the Missouri, the letter urged Heney to
                  employ every means to pacify or at least neutralize Teton power. So long as the

                  slowly die. Lewis and Clark explained to Heney that American Indian policy was
                  based on peace and reconciliation. But the iron fist of coercion was undisguised
                  in the letter. If the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> did not allow passage of American trade goods, Lewis and Clark
                  were "positive that she [the United States] will not long suffer her citizens to
                  be deprived of the free navigation of the Missouri by a fiew comparatively feeble
                  bands of Savages who be so illy advised as to refuse her profered friendship and
                  continue their depridation on her citizens who may in future assend or decend the
                  river." The captains' claims that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors amounted to "comparatively feeble bands of Savages"
                  would have surprised men like Black Buffalo and the Partisan who had effectively
                  derailed American policy two years before. The letter suggests that when it came
                  to understanding plains Indian politics, the explorers had still not learned the
                  lessons of the Teton confrontation.<ref target="n0951" n="51"/>

            <div type="section">
               <p> One day after leaving Travelers' Rest, Lewis and his party were reminded of the
                  dangers that lay ahead. Lewis knew that entering Blackfeet and Atsina territories
                  was risky, but when his <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref> guides left him and warned that the "Pahkees" would "cut us
                  off," the full weight of that danger came home. Two days later, when Lewis and his
                  men were at the Big Blackfoot River, they saw so many abandoned lodges as to
                  become "much on our guard both day and night." Lewis's concern was justified, but
                  by the time his detachment reached the Great Falls of the Missouri on July 15,
                  they still had seen no Indians. Once at the falls, Lewis selected Reuben and
                  Joseph Field and George Drouillard to take part in what was to be the most violent
                  Indian encounter in expedition history.<ref target="n0952" n="52"/>
               </p>
               <p> Leaving Great Falls on July 17, the explorers rode northwest, believing this
                  route would bring them to the Teton or Rose River and then on to the Marias. On
                  Montana shortgrass plains as flat as "a well shaved bowling green," Lewis and his
                  men maintained a "strict lookout" for any Indians. By July 21 a disappointed Lewis
                  realized that the course of the Marias was not as northward as he had hoped. That
                  unhappy discovery was overshadowed on the following days as the explorers found
                  more signs that Indians were nearby. When the ever-watchful Drouillard located a
                  cluster of eleven recently abandoned skin lodges, Lewis assumed that these were
                  made by Atsina buffalo hunters camped along the main branch of the Marias. At Camp
                  Disappointment on July 25, there were even more traces of recent native presence.
                  As he had once before, Lewis wrote that he was "extreemly fortunate in not having
                  met with these people."<ref target="n0953" n="53"/>
               </p>
               <p> The captain's good fortune ran out the next day, July 27. Leaving Camp
                  Disappointment, Lewis rode with the Field brothers while Drouillard scouted the
                  Two Medicine River valley. At midafternoon, as Lewis forded Badger Creek and came
                  up a sharp rise, he spotted to his far left some thirty horses, about half having
                  saddles. The captain quickly drew out his small telescope for a closer look. He
                  saw "a very unpleasant sight." Standing out against the afternoon sky were several
                  Indians looking intently down toward the Two Medicine River valley and its
                  cottonwood fringe. These Indians were so fixed on watching Drouillard that they
                  did not appear to notice Lewis and his companions. Lewis immediately decided to
                  make the best of an uncertain situation and proceeded to "approach them in a
                  friendly way."<ref target="n0954" n="54"/>
               </p>
               <p> To signal their intention, Lewis sent Joseph Field riding on ahead with an
                  American flag. At that moment, the Indians saw the Lewis forces and became
                  frightened. As Lewis later explained, they "appeared to run about in a very
                  confused manner as if much allarmed." Plainly fearing an attack, several Indians
                  came down toward the horses and drove them back up to the summit. If the Indians
                  were fearful of hostilities, Lewis was equally concerned. He believed that there
                  might be at least as many warriors as there were horses—surely a daunting
                  thought. Lewis was also convinced that any attempt to escape from such a large,
                  well-armed war party would invite disaster. Riding on, the Americans came to
                  within a quarter of a mile of the warriors before the Indians made any move toward
                  them.</p>
               <p> Some hint of what was going on in the minds of the Piegan warriors comes from an
                  interview conducted in the early 1900s by the ethnologist George Bird Grinnell
                  with an elderly Piegan named Wolf Calf. Wolf Calf was the youngest member of the
                  war party, and his recollections of that meeting with Lewis were still vivid and
                  remarkably accurate. The Indian admitted that his companions were both surprised
                  and frightened when they saw Lewis's men but decided to act in "a friendly
                  fashion" for at least a short time. That decision was made plain when one Indian
                  galloped toward Lewis at full tilt. Seeing this and understanding it was not a
                  general charge, Lewis dismounted and extended his hand to the Piegan. The warrior
                  eyed Lewis and then cantered his horse back to the main Blackfeet group. Whatever
                  this scout said to his fellows was not recorded by Wolf Calf, but the fact that
                  all eight soon came riding to meet the Americans perhaps suggests that the Indians
                  were now confident of their own security.</p>
               <p> As the Blackfeet neared Lewis and the Field brothers, the captain remained
                  certain that additional warriors were still hiding close at hand. Claiming an
                  expertise that was not really his, Lewis told Joseph and Reuben that these Indians
                  were "Minnetarees of Fort de Prairie" or Atsinas. Using language filled with more
                  swagger than wisdom, Lewis pronounced his willingness to "resist to the last
                  extremity prefering death to that of being deprived of my papers instruments and
                  gun." Lewis, once again on his horse, advanced slowly and met the one Indian who
                  was ahead of the rest. Both men cautiously shook hands and then moved on to use
                  the same welcome with those behind. This accomplished, Lewis dismounted. Perhaps
                  thinking this signaled the beginning of a parley, the Indians asked for pipes and
                  tobacco. Those supplies were with Drouillard who was still down along the Two
                  Medicine. While one Indian joined Reuben Field to find Drouillard, Lewis tried his
                  hand at some sign language. Inquiring as to what tribe these men belonged, Lewis
                  understood their answer to be that they were Atsinas. Although unquestionably they
                  were Piegans, there are two possible explanations for Lewis's faulty
                  identification. Because the expedition's most skilled sign language interpreter
                  was still down in the river valley, Lewis may have simply misunderstood what was
                  being signed. It is equally possible that the Piegans, already thinking about
                  stealing guns and horses, hoped to shift the blame on other Indians. Whatever the
                  case, Lewis's attempt at conversation as well as his handing out of medals, flags,
                  and handkerchiefs did little to calm the edgy Piegans. They seemed "more allarmed
                  at this accedental interview than we were." Still worried about more warriors, and
                  with evening approaching, Lewis suggested leaving high ground for a camp nearer
                  the river. Guiding their horses down steep bluffs made more dangerous by loose,
                  slippery gravel, the explorers and their nervous Blackfeet hosts made their way to
                  three solitary cottonwood trees near the Two Medicine River.</p>
               <p> At those trees which still stand near the river, the Blackfeet put up a makeshift
                  shelter of buffalo skins. Then the Indians invited Lewis's party to join them.
                  Lewis was anxious to learn as much as possible from the Piegans. Using
                  Drouillard's signs, he conducted "much conversation" inside the hide wickiup that
                  night. The Blackfeet said that they were part of a large band camped along the
                  Marias. Lewis must have perked up when he heard that this band had a white trader
                  in camp. He may well have urged Drouillard to press the Piegans for more details
                  about Blackfeet-Canadian trade. What Lewis learned simply reenforced Jefferson's
                  worst fears. Agents of the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company were
                  firmly entrenched on the northern plains and were rapidly extending their
                  influence throughout the region. The Blackfeet made regular visits to posts like
                  Buckingham House and Rocky Mountain House along the North Saskatchewan River.
                  Those Indians brought to the "Northern White Men" wolf and beaver pelts for guns,
                  ammunition, and alcohol. Their loyalty to the Canadians made it clear that
                  American fur traders would find this part of the northern plains a hard market to
                     crack.<ref target="n0955" n="55"/>
               </p>
               <p> Although what Lewis heard form the Piegans worried him, what he said frightened
                  them. Explaining that he came from the east and had been beyond the mountains to
                  the great ocean, Lewis unwittingly dropped a geo-political bombshell by declaring
                  that the Blackfeet's traditional enemies—the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref>, and Kutenais—were now united by an American-inspired
                  peace. Even more shocking to Piegan ears was word that these united tribes would
                  be getting guns and supplies from Yankee traders. If Lewis thought the Blackfeet
                  would receive such news with glad hearts and then join an American alliance, he
                  gravely misjudged western realities. That night along the Two Medicine the
                  explorer, in effect, announced the clash of empires had come to the Blackfeet.
                  After more than twenty years of unchallenged power on the plains made possible by
                  Canadian guns, the Blackfeet now faced a profound threat to their power and
                  survival. Unaware that this was a frontal assault on Blackfeet influence, Lewis
                  invited the warriors to help form a delegation of chiefs and elders for additional
                  talks in Washington. To make that offer more attractive, he promised ten horses
                  and much tobacco to those who ventured east to see the great chief of the
                  seventeen fires. But all this naive talk did not hide the fact that Lewis and his
                  men were among well-armed Piegans whose intentions were unclear. Had the captain
                  known what young Wolf Calf knew that night—that a decision had been made to
                  steal the expedition's guns—the explorer might have doubled the watch.<ref target="n0956" n="56"/>
               </p>
               <p> In the chill dawn hours of July 27, Joseph Field struggled to fight back sleep
                  and keep his watch. As soon as it was light, the Piegans were up and crowding
                  around the fire. Intent on watching them, Field carelessly laid his gun behind him
                  and close to his sleeping brother Reuben. One of the Indians, seeing the gun
                  unguarded, slipped behind Joseph and quietly took the weapon. That act was a
                  signal for other Indians to take guns belonging to Lewis and Drouillard. Still
                  unnoticed, the Piegans then attempted to make good their escape with valuable
                  booty. It was only then that Joseph Field saw what was happening and shouted to
                  rouse his sleeping brother. Reuben, armed only with a broad-blade knife, gave
                  angry chase. He proved a faster runner than a Piegan named Side Hill Calf. Field
                  caught the Indian, pulled the guns away, and in a moment of fury thrust his knife
                  into the man's chest. When an excited Reuben Field told John Ordway late the next
                  day about the deed, he said that Side Hill Calf "drew but one breath [and] the
                  wind of his breath followed the knife and he fell dead."</p>
               <p> But Side Hill Calf's violent end was only the beginning of confusion and
                  bloodletting around the lonely cottonwoods. Awakened by all the shouting,
                  Drouillard saw an Indian making off with his rifle and shot pouch. Springing up,
                  the Frenchman yelled, "Damn you let go my gun," and wrested it from the Piegan's
                  hands. That shout awakened Lewis, who by his own admission had been in "a profound
                  sleep." Still groggy, Lewis demanded to know what was going on. What he saw was
                  explanation enough as Drouillard scuffled with the Indian. Going to aid the
                  interpreter, Lewis reached for his rifle only to find it missing. He then drew his
                  horse pistol and began to run after one of the fleeing Piegans. Quickly overtaking
                  him, Lewis leveled his pistol at the Indian and demanded return of the rifle. The
                  hapless thief was about to do as ordered when the Field brothers, still boiling
                  with anger, came up and asked permission to shoot the Indian. Lewis wisely refused
                  a similar request from Drouillard, who had now captured the would-be robber of his
                  weapon.</p>
               <p> It now appeared that the Piegan plan had been thwarted and the Blackfeet might
                  quietly retire. If Lewis believed that, he was soon jolted back to a harsher
                  reality. Once the Indians saw that the Americans had all their guns back, the
                  Blackfeet turned their attention to the expedition's horses. Losing guns was
                  serious enough, but without horses Lewis and his men would be stranded in a
                  difficult country. For the Piegans, it seemed a last chance to rescue some honor
                  and bring home valuable prizes. Now they threatened the survival of the American
                  detachment and the ultimate success of the whole western venture. Understanding
                  the stakes, Lewis ordered his men to open fire on any Indians trying to make off
                  with horses. Whie the Field brothers and Drouillard pursued some Blackfeet, Lewis
                  ran after two Piegans doing just that. Nearly out of breath from the long dash,
                  Lewis called on the Indians to release the stolen horses or he would fire. One
                  Indian hid behind some mushroom-shaped rocks and called to his friend, standing
                  about thirty paces from Lewis. That armed Indian suddenly turned around and
                  squarely faced Lewis. Certain he was about to be attacked, the captain shot his
                  adversary through the stomach. Stunned by what was plainly a mortal wound, the
                  warrior fell to his knees. Then suddenly he raised himself up on one elbow and
                  fired a desperate shot at Lewis. But from his awkward position the dying man could
                  not take clean aim and the ball went whistling just over the captain's head.
                  "Being bearheaded," recalled Lewis, "I felt the wind of his bullet very
                  distinctly."</p>
               <p> As quickly as the Two Medicine fight had exploded in two deaths, it was over.
                  Whatever the combatants on both sides felt about each other, all were united by a
                  common desire—to escape as quickly as possible. Fleeing north, the six
                  surviving Piegans must have feared that more armed whites were on the way. Lewis
                  was equally fearful of Blackfeet revenge. He ordered the horses rounded up and
                  decided to use the stronger Indian ones to make good a speedy escape. While
                  Drouillard and the Field brothers prepared the horses, Lewis gathered up shields,
                  bows, and arrows abandoned by the Piegans. He burned the weapons and in a final
                  act of defiance put a peace medal around Side Hill Calf's neck so that "they might
                  be informed who we were." As if to count coup on the Blackfeet, Lewis cut off the
                  amulets from the shields and took them along as spoils of war.<ref target="n0957" n="57"/>
               </p>
               <p> What remained now was to escape the Two Medicine killing ground. Ahead lay two
                  full days of hard riding over broken ground to reach Ordway's party on the
                  Missouri. When Lewis and his men finally reached the great river on the afternoon
                  of July 28, they had "the unspeakable satisfaction to see our canoes coming down."
                  Lewis and his tired companions left behind at the Two Medicine the seed of a myth
                  that has long shaped popular understanding of the Blackfeet fight. That myth links
                  the Two Medicine encounter with later Blackfeet-American hostilities. As the story
                  goes, the violence directed against American fur traders in the years after Lewis
                  and Clark was the result of Piegan revenge wreaked on the killers of Side Hill
                  Calf and his unnamed fellow warrior. The death of George Drouillard at Three Forks
                  in 1810 at the hands of a Blackfeet war party has been used to strengthen the
                  claim for an undying Indian vengeance.</p>
               <p> The Two Medicine myth was not the product of anything either the explorers or
                  their contemporaries wrote about the fight or about later trapper troubles.
                  Rather, the tale appears to have its genesis in the fertile imagination of
                  Washington Irving. In his <hi rend="italic">Astoria,</hi> Irving claimed that the
                  Blackfeet had "conceived an implacable hostility to the white men, in consequence
                  of one of their warriors having been killed by Captain Lewis, while attempting to
                  steal horses." When David H. Coyner published his <hi rend="italic">The Lost
                     Trappers</hi> in 1847, he repeated Irving's claim and added, "The act created
                  an implacable hatred for the whites from that day till this." By the time Elliott
                  Coues produced his edition of Nicholas Biddle's <hi rend="italic">History</hi> in
                  1893, the legend was in full bloom. Coues gave his stamp of approval to the tale
                  in a footnote citing the Irving account and stories he heard on the northern
                  Montana frontier in 1874. Although historians from Hiram Chittenden to more recent
                  scholars have discredited this interpretation of native behavior and have
                  suggested more persuasive explanations, the myth continues to be repeated in
                  popular accounts of the expedition as well as in an occasional serious study.<ref target="n0958" n="58"/>

               <p> As Alvin Josephy, Jr., pointed out in 1965, the key to understanding Blackfeet
                  actions toward American traders comes from something Lewis himself said that July
                  night around the fire along the Two Medicine. After telling the Piegans that their
                  traditional enemies had been united in a peace promoted by American diplomats,
                  Lewis dropped the other shoe. Traders from St. Louis were going to sell guns to
                  those united tribes, thus challenging the place of the Piegan, Blood, and Siksika
                  peoples. All of that seemed to come terribly true in subsequent years. By
                  1807–1808, men working for St. Louis entrepreneurs were busy trading with
                  Blackfeet rivals. When a former member of the expedition, John Colter, joined in
                  an 1808 battle with <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref> and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> warriors against the Blackfeet, the message was not lost on
                  anyone. It may well have been that those merchants in places like Rocky Mountain
                  House saw to it that the import of that message was fully understood. In the face
                  of a massive assault on their plains empire, Blackfeet warriors hardly had time to
                  think of avenging Side Hill Calf and his unfortunate companion. Lewis was
                  unwittingly the prophet of events like the 1821 Immell-Jones massacre; he was not
                  their cause. The bloody fray on the morning of July 27 provides a window into the
                  ever-unstable balance of plains power. Although Blackfeet revenge against
                  Americans for the deeds of Reuben Field and Meriwether Lewis may satisfy the
                  modern writer's sense of historical symmetry, it was the more potent forces of
                  guns and international trade that made the Blackfeet feared by a generation of
                  American mountain men.<ref target="n0959" n="59"/>

               <p> It was not until noon on August 12, 1806, that the Corps of Discovery
                  reassembled. Much had happened since those days at Travelers' Rest. Clark's party
                  had explored the Yellowstone, the plan for Pryor to carry a letter to Hugh Heney
                  had misfired when <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Crow.xml"
                       rend="box">Crow</ref> Indians stole expedition horses, and Lewis had been wounded in a
                  freak hunting accident. But now on the Missouri below the Yellowstone, the company
                  was whole again. What remained of its Indian business was the same thorny problem
                  that had occupied so much time during the winter with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>. Establishing peace among Mandan, HIdatsa, and Arikara
                  villagers and the consequences of that peace were at the heart of that problem.
                  Lewis and Clark had not abandoned their commitment to a villager alliance aimed at
                  eliminating or reducing <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> influence. The explorers thought they had successfully planted
                  the seeds of that policy during their first winter. In truth, the alliance and the
                  tactics to execute it were no more realistic in 1806 than they had been in 1804.
                  But realism had never been part of the expedition's Indian policy. As the
                  explorer-diplomats began their final talks with the Indians, there was no reason
                  to think that they might suddenly understand the Missouri facts of life.<ref target="n0960" n="60"/>
               </p>
               <p> For three days beginning on August 14, William Clark carried on constant and
                  sometimes difficult negotiations with Mandan and Hidatsa leaders. Neither cast nor
                  lines had changed much since the explorers and the Indians had met during the
                  winter of 1804–1805. The issues—trade, sovereignty, and the villager
                  alliance—were the same. Black Cat, Sheheke, Black Moccasin, Little Raven,
                  and Le Borgne were familiar faces from the earlier scene. Believing that the
                  Mandan chief Black Cat was the key to American success, Clark quickly sought him
                  out after paying brief calls at the villages of Metaharta and Mahawha. Black Cat
                  greeted Clark with customary warmth, and together the two men shared a summer
                  squash and smoked a friendly pipe.</p>
               <p> Anxious to begin talks on the delegation issue as soon as possible, Clark
                  detailed Charbonneau to call on Hidatsa chiefs while Drouillard was sent to
                  Sheheke's village to hire René Jusseaume as council interpreter. When
                  Jusseaume arrived at the expedition's camp just above Matootonha village, the
                  talks began. Following a familiar agenda, Clark first renewed the invitation to
                  visit Washington and speak with the president. Black Cat agreed with such a
                  journey would be important but insisted that the price in danger exacted by Teton
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors was too high. It was just those kinds of fears that
                  Clark sought to allay. Claiming more power than either the expedition or the
                  United States actually had, he told Black Cat that the Americans "would not suffer
                  those Indians [the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>] to hurt any of our red children who should think proper to
                  accompany us." Bent on making promises even more difficult to keep, Clark offered
                  continued federal military protection against hostile raiders after the chiefs
                  returned home. To make American proposals more palatable, Clark reminded Black Cat
                  that there would be lavish gifts for all who ventured so far from home.</p>
               <p> This exchange was interrupted by the arrival of Le Borgne. If there was one man
                  the explorers had failed to impress during the Mandan winter, it was this powerful
                  and astute Hidatsa chief. That Le Borgne now came without much coaxing illustrated
                  his recognition that some accommodation might be necessary with the persistent
                  strangers from downriver. Knowing how important this moment was, Clark rounded up
                  whatever other chiefs he could find and assembled them along the riverbank. With
                  Jusseaume as interpreter, Clark once again repeated the familiar litany of
                  American proposals. Delegations could see for themselves the wealth and power of
                  the American nation. Clark encouraged quick action on the invitation, hinting that
                  a prompt decision would hasten the arrival of quality trade goods at reasonable
                  prices.</p>
               <p> Le Borgne's reply was characterized by the kind of political acumen that marked
                  so much of his diplomacy with both Indians and whites. He showed some passing
                  interest in making the long trip to Washington but insisted that dangers posed by
                  the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> made the journey far too harzardous. "The <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were in the road," he said, "and would most certainly kill him or
                  any others who should go down." Suddenly turning the negotiating tables, the chief
                  observed that the American claim to have brought peace to the Missouri was not
                  true. <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> warriors had recently killed eight Hidatsas and taken
                  some horses. And there had been renewed tension with the Arikaras. If Lewis and
                  Clark were peacemakers of dubious repute, Le Borgne boasted that he had done much
                  better. The chief had recently negotiated a complex trade agreement with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>. When the Americans pacified the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, then Le Borgne might consider a visit to the federal father.<ref target="n0961" n="61"/>
               </p>
               <p> Clark must have finally realized that Le Borgne was not a likely prospect for
                  conversion to client-chief status. But there was always Black Cat. When he asked
                  Clark to make a second visit to Rooptahee, the captain may have taken new hope
                  that the delegation problem was nearing some solution. As the two men again shared
                  a pipe, Black Cat broke the news Clark most feared. Because "the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> were still very troublesom," not a single prominent man was
                  willing to risk a Missouri voyage. Black Cat tried to soften the blow by offering
                  twelve bushels of corn from what had been a slim harvest. But that well-meaning
                  gesture could not hide a serious failure of the expedition. Plainly disappointed,
                  Clark urged the chief and his elders to "pitch on some man which they could rely
                  and send him to see their great father." After more objections were aired, one
                  young man stepped forward and agreed to go. But when George Gibson reported that
                  the man had taken his knife, all fury broke loose. For all the comic overtones in
                  a process that seemed to move two steps back for every one forward, Clark was
                  justifiable angry. Tongue-lashed by Clark, the chief and elders hung their heads.
                  Black Cat broke the painful silence and admitted that fear of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> ambushes and reprisal made it impossible for anyone to accompany
                  the expedition. At last Clark seemed to grasp the depth of Mandan concern. To his
                  credit, he gracefully accepted the inevitable and quietly spent more time smoking
                  with Black Cat.</p>
               <p> Later the same day, August 15, Jusseaume brought some startling news. The
                  Frenchman claimed that Little Raven, second chief at Matootonha, had expressed a
                  desire to go with the expedition. After so many false starts and setbacks, Clark
                  was determined not to let this opportunity slip away. Taking Charbonneau with him,
                  Clark hurried to the Mandan village for a talk with Little Raven. The chief
                  acknowledged his interest in the journey but wanted to talk with friends and
                  family before setting out on so dangerous a course. A pipe of tobacco moved that
                  intention along and Clark returned to his camp thinking the delegation issue
                  settled at last.</p>
               <p> What Clark heard late that night made the need for any diplomatic success even
                  more urgent. Since returning to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages, Charbonneau had
                  spent some time at Metaharta, where he and Sacagawea had lived before joining the
                  expedition. From those contacts he had learned that several Hidatsa war parties
                  had gone out against Camehwait's Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and the Grand River Arikaras. Such news plainly demonstrated
                  the fragile character of any villager alliance. Even more worrisome, continued
                  Hidatsa forays against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> and other potential American allies could only subvert and
                  discredit diplomatic efforts made over the past two years. A symbolic gesture in
                  the form of a Mandan-Hidatsa delegation could not change old patterns of warfare,
                  but it might rescue the expedition's diplomatic reputation.<ref target="n0962" n="62"/>
               </p>
               <p> On August 16, compelled by a sense of desperation, Clark made one last effort to
                  fashion a respectable delegation. When Le Borgne and several other Hidatsa chiefs
                  appeared uninvited at the American camp, he was given a rare opportunity. Here was
                  a final chance to impress Le Borgne and perhaps bring him into the federal fold.
                  Clark may have even dared to hope that at least one Hidatsa might join Little
                  Raven to form a genuinely representative delegation. Pulling out all the
                  ceremonial stops, the captains decided to give Le Borgne one of the swivel guns
                  that had originally been on the keelboat. As Clark had the cannon loaded, he
                  offered a double-barreled message. Raids against the "pore defenceless Snake
                  Indians" had to stop, and such a potent weapon could always be used to defend
                  American friends.</p>
               <p> Although Le Borgne was plainly pleased with the gift, it was the elderly chief
                  Caltarcota who now replied to Clark. The Hidatsa orator, who had so effectively
                  challenged the expedition's diplomacy two years before, now repeated what must
                  have been painfully familiar to all the explorers. The Hidatsas wanted to see the
                  great father, but so long as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> stood in the way such a trip was impossible. But Caltarcota had
                  more to say and more than Clark wanted to hear. The Hidatsa chief had been opposed
                  to an Arikara peace and lessening of tensions with the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> in 1804, and nothing he had heard since had changed his mind.
                  Raids against enemies were both strategically wise and culturally necessary. The
                  Hidatsas were not about to alter old ways and endanger village security simply to
                  please the seemingly odd whims of unpredictable strangers. There would be no
                  Hidatsa representatives, nor would there be any promises of peace and cooperation.
                  Le Borgne proudly took the cannon back to his village, but as was so often the
                  case, the American diplomats were left with empty hands and empty promises.</p>
               <p> For all the disappointment with the Hidatsas, Clark felt certain that he still
                  had Little Raven as a token delegate. Later on the evening of August 16, Clark
                  walked to Matootonha to keep up the chief's resolve. To his astonishment, Clark
                  was bluntly told that Little Raven had changed his mind and would not accompany
                  the expedition downriver. Not even a gift of a flag could change the Indian's
                  mind. When Clark pressed Jusseaume to find reasons for this unwelcome change of
                  heart, the interpreter reported that there had been a serious argument between
                  Sheheke and Little Raven. Sheheke was evidently jealous of the prestige offered to
                  Little Raven. At this point a frustrated Clark simply did not care who the
                  delegate was so long as he was of sufficient rank and influence. Turning again to
                  Jusseaume, Clark asked him to use his influence to enlist Sheheke in the
                  expedition's ranks. The trader, a man always in search of the main chance, drove a
                  hard bargain. He promised to deliver Sheheke if the Americans agreed to provide
                  transportation and rations for the Sheheke and Jusseaume families. Worn down by
                  days of fruitless talk and seeing no alternatives, Clark grudgingly agreed.<ref target="n0963" n="63"/>
               </p>
               <p> Saturday, August 17, was a day to tie up loose ends. There were brief but
                  inconclusive talks with some Hidatsa chiefs, financial settlements with
                  Charbonneau and a fur trade-bound John Colter, and some poignant words from Clark
                  about the future of Sacagawea's young Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, "a butifull
                  promising child." By midmorning the expedition was at Matootonha to pick up the
                  Sheheke and Jusseaume entourages. The explorers were already anticipating the joys
                  of a festive homecoming, but when Clark came to Sheheke's lodge he saw what it
                  meant for the Mandan chief to leave for an uncertain future. Grim-faced elders sat
                  smoking farewell pipes while women wept. Despite Clark's efforts to reassure the
                  villagers with gifts of powder and bullets, "maney of them cried out aloud" as
                  Sheheke and his family went to the canoes. Tears and gunpowder were not the sort
                  of legacy Lewis and Clark wanted to leave behind.<ref target="n0964" n="64"/>
               </p>
               <p> Only one piece of Indian diplomacy was left before reaching St. Louis. The role
                  of the Arikaras in Middle Missouri trade and politics had always eluded Lewis and
                  Clark. The explorers simply could not comprehend the intricate relationship
                  between Arikara farmers and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> hunters. In the eyes of the explorers, the Arikaras should have
                  been willing recruits in the struggle against Teton power. That <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and Arikara warriors continued to carry out joint raids against
                  Mandan and Hidatsa towns was bewildering. How could the Arikaras pursue a policy
                  that further bound them to their <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> oppressors? Lewis and Clark hoped that the earlier delegation
                  sent under Joseph Gravelines, and now the presence of Sheheke, might at last end
                  the raids that fueled endless hostilities.</p>
               <p> By the morning of August 21, the expedition was at the Grand River and the
                  Arikara villages. After exchanging volleys of shots in greeting, the Americans
                  landed opposite the upper village of Waho-erha. While securing their canoes, the
                  explorers could not miss the white skin lodges that dotted the hillsides above the
                  Arikara towns. Those tepees belonged to <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> who regularly traded for Arikara corn. Lewis and Clark had
                  met individual <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> during the Fort Mandan winter, but now there was a chance for
                  serious talks with these important plains people. Once on shore, Clark was greeted
                  by a crowd of friendly and inquisitive Arikaras and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>.</p>
               <p> Without further ceremony, Clark decided to hold a council. Putting Sheheke to his
                  left, he faced a semicircle of eager Indians. To symbolize the hoped-for peace
                  between villages, Sheheke offered Mandan tobacco for all to smoke. Encouraged by
                  the acceptance of that gift, Clark launched into a capsule history of the
                  expedition, relating "where we had been, what we had done and said to the
                  different nations." He was aided in that narrative by the presence of the trader
                  and translator Joseph Garreau. As Clark surveyed the assembled dignitaries, he may
                  have noticed a man of substantial importance who had not been seen in October
                  1804. That man was Grey Eyes, who had taken the place of Kakawissassa as principal
                  chief and would lead defiance against American forces in 1823. After being
                  introduced to Grey Eyes, Clark again emphasized the need for peace with neighbors
                  and unity against the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>. The Arikara chief than delivered a "very animated" speech,
                  filled with rhetorical sound and fury denouncing the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> as "bad people." But the sharp words were intended to please
                  Clark and did not signify any change in Arikara policy. Grey Eyes certainly wished
                  that the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> might be less troublesome at market times, but he was
                  not about to alienate so strong and important a customer in order to please
                  untested whites.</p>
               <p> As the day grew hotter and the diplomacy less successful, Clark was grateful when
                  a <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> chief invited him to enjoy the shade of a tepee.
                  Making little progress with the Arikaras, the captain hoped for better with the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>. After smoking with the chief, Clark offered him a
                  small peace medal. It was an awkward moment when the frightened chief firmly
                  rejected the gift. "He knew that the white people were all medecine," explained
                  Clark, "and was afraid of the medal or anything that white people gave them." It
                  was only with the greatest difficulty that Clark convinced the chief that flags
                  and medals were signs of status and prestige, not carriers of disease and death.
                  As things fell out, American diplomacy proved more successful with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref> than the Arikaras. Just before leaving the villages on August
                  22, Clark was approached by several <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> chiefs who asked that American traders be sent among them to
                  teach proper trapping techniques. That was the kind of request to gladden the
                  heart of any St. Louis merchant.<ref target="n0965" n="65"/>
               </p>
               <p> But <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> requests were still in the future as Sheheke, who
                  had accompanied Clark to the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> camp, offered a long discourse on villager tensions—a
                  diatribe that contained more self-justification than serius analysis. The Mandan's
                  torrent of invective was finally checked when the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyenne</ref> chief caustically observed that all the village folk shared a
                  measure of blame. Never one to miss a chance to press the fundamentals of American
                  Indian policy, Clark again insisted that "if they wished to be happy they must
                  shake off all intimecy with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> and unite themselves in a strong alliance and attend to what he
                  had told them." But, as before, American proposals got no more than token
                  assent.</p>
               <p> Unnoticed throughout the day was the growing tension caused by the presence of
                  Sheheke and his family. They were constant reminders of all the blows and strikes
                  the Arikaras and the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> had exchanged over the years. Resentment finally exploded late
                  in the evening. Sheheke found himself embroiled in an acrimonious shouting match
                  with an Arikara chief named One Arm. Fearful that One Arm's "loud and thretening
                  tone" might lead to violence, Clark stepped in and reminded the Arikaras that
                  Sheheke was under American protection. Any harm done to him would bring a strong
                  response from the expedition. That threat evidently worked since Clark finished
                  the evening hearing One Arm and the other chiefs swear peace toward the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref> and loyalty to the United States.<ref target="n0966" n="66"/>
               </p>
               <p> But their solemn oaths meant little. The next morning, as the expedition prepared
                  to make the final pull for St. Louis, Garreau reported that the Arikara chiefs had
                  decided not to form another delegation until the first party had safely returned.
                  And the Arikara leaders themselves again told Clark how dependent they were on the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> for guns and ammunition. Those were facts that not even the most
                  adept diplomat could shape to fit an American mold. Except for the interest in the
                  fur trade shown by the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Cheyenne.xml"
                       rend="box">Cheyennes</ref>, the expedition left the Arikaras with little to call
                     success.<ref target="n0967" n="67"/>
               </p>
               <p> The next month saw Lewis and Clark sprint for home. Moving quickly with the
                  Missouri current, the expedition often covered fifty or sixty miles in a day.
                  Despite unending mosquito attacks, sudden rain squalls, and sore eyes from river
                  glare, the men "ply'd their orers very well." But Black Buffalo and the Brulé
                  Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref>, those most redoubtable of expedition adversaries, were
                  not about to allow Lewis and Clark to leave the river without one last set-to. At
                  the end of August, as the Americans neared present-day Yankton, South Dakota, they
                  spotted Black Buffalo and a large band of well-armed men along the river bank.
                  What ensued was a nasty verbal exchange that pitted Clark and Jusseaume against
                  Black Buffalo. The jeering and hooting so unnerved the explorers that when they
                  came upon some friendly Yankton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> two days later there was nearly fatal gunfire.</p>
               <p> But raw nerves were soothed in the days that followed. Edginess was replaced by
                  excitement. Every day brought fresh signs that the great venture—what Lewis
                  had once called "a darling project of mine"—was nearly done. New clothes,
                  tobacco, and alcohol obtained from trader James Aird brought the men of the
                  expedition one step closer to home and further from the life they had shared for
                  so long. And then in the third week of September there were the familiar sights
                  and faces of St. Louis and what had been the Corps of Discovery was about to
                  escape into national history and myth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p> The final scene in a drama that had so long bound together the lives of Indians
                  and explorers was played out on September 23 at Fort Bellefontaine along the
                  Missouri above St. Louis. Sentries on duty that cold, wet morning were perhaps the
                  only audience as Clark escorted Sheheke to the "publick store" so that the Mandan
                  chief could outfit himself and his family in the latest fashion.<ref target="n0968" n="68"/> As the Indian searched through stacks of calico shirts,
                  fancy handkerchiefs, and colored beads, he symbolized the first fruits of the
                  Lewis and Clark expedition. The explorers brought Indian America face to face with
                  the Industrial Revolution and a rising American empire. Still ahead for people
                  from the Missouri to the Columbia were more delegations, more talks, and more
                  troubles. The calloused hands of the explorers had delivered the Indians into the
                  finer fingers of agents, merchants, and bureaucrats. But, for now, none of that
                  was clear to grizzled veterans or to an anxious Indians. For Lewis and Clark,
                  there was only the homecoming reserved to those once feared lost and now found.
                  Men of the expedition were about to reenter a familiar world; Sheheke and his kin
                  could not say the same. The Mandan chief, dressed in the best the young Republic
                  could afford, did not know how much those explorers had forever changed his world.

               <p> On a cold rainy day in mid-May 1806, Meriwether Lewis sat in camp along the
                  Clearwater River and wondered where the Indians were. For the first time in many
                  weeks no <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref> came to talk, trade, or stare at the bearded
                     strangers.<ref target="n1001" n="1"/> It was almost two years to the day since
                  the Lewis and Clark expedition had begun its western venture. Those years had been
                  filled with a native presence that bound Indians and explorers together in a
                  common struggle to survive. Formal conferences, personal friendships, and chance
                  meetings all bridged the cultural divide. Indians were so much a part of the life
                  of the expedition that their absence was worthy of note. When no Indians were
                  present as actors and audience, Lewis and Clark felt strangely alone.</p>
               <p> Whether written as simple fact or out of belief to be free from inquisitive
                  neighbors, Lewis's observation reveals something fundamental about western
                  exploration in general and Thomas Jefferson's Corps of Discovery in particular.
                  Exploration was a cooperative endeavor requiring substantial information and
                  support from the Indians. The Indians shaped the exploratory effort by their very
                  presence on the land. They were people to be reckoned with, whether as potential
                  sources of aid or as possible enemies. No latter-day Coronado or Champlain could
                  ignore them. The anticipated behavior of the Indians was a decisive factor in the
                  choice of equipment, personnel, routes, camp rules, and even ultimate destination.
                  Whatever the official objectives, explorers carefully considered their
                  presence.</p>
               <p> But we need to measure more than explorer's reactions to a passive population.
                  Indians were active participants in exploration, as the first comers to the land
                  and, later, as guides for Euro-Americans. To a vast enterprise they lent their
                  intelligence, skill, and nerve. Certainly the Lewis and Clark expedition benefited
                  greatly from the Indians' knowledge and support. Maps, route information, food,
                  horses, openhanded friendship—all gave the Corps of Discovery the edge that
                  spelled the difference between success and failure. The presence of Sacagawea on
                  the expedition's roster is only the barest hint of what Indian support meant to
                  Lewis's "darling project." That roster should also include names like Sheheke,
                  Cameahwait, Old Toby, Tetoharsky, Twisted Hair, and Flint Necklace. There needs to
                  be a place for those unnamed <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> women who carried expedition baggage over Lemhi Pass as well
                  as for countless Indians who traded food and affection. As guides, packers,
                  interpreters, and cartographers, native Americans were essential to Lewis and
                  Clark's achievement.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark left St. Louis filled with apprehension about encounters with
                  hostile Indians. But what emerged over nearly two and a half years of western
                  travel was an atmosphere of friendship and mutual trust between men and women who
                  shared a common frontier life. Indians and explorers stood together in the rituals
                  of hunting, holidays, and horse racing. Sex, sports, and music were simple
                  pleasures that united strangers. Lewis admitted as much when he wrote, "So long
                  have our men been accustomed to a friendly intercourse with the natives, that we
                  find it difficult to impress on their minds the necessity of always being on guard
                  with rispect to them."<ref target="n1002" n="2"/> The assertion that the Corps of
                  Discovery acted like "a conquering army" of hungry imperialists does not square
                  with either the Lewis and Clark record or the larger history of North American
                     exploration.<ref target="n1003" n="3"/> Lewis and Clark neither enslaved
                  Indians as did DeSoto nor pillaged pueblos as did Coronado. Stealing a canoe from
                  Cobowawy and tricking Cameahwait stand out in the journal notes because they were
                  exceptional acts, not typical of the captains and their crew.</p>
               <p> The typical patterns of friendship and sharing that generally characterized
                  Indian-expedition relations were not the result of any special nobility of
                  character on either side of the cultural divide. Native hospitality was both
                  genuine and useful as tribal people sought trade or attempted to manipulate the
                  expedition for personal ends. For their part, Lewis and Clark recognized the
                  necessity of Indian cooperation. There were undeniable moments of swagger,
                  bluster, and arrogance, but more often than not good sense and patience won the
                  day. Clark once bragged that he could have tomahawked terrified Umatillas, but he
                  did not do the deed. Despite angry threats, no member of the expedition put the
                  torch to mat lodges at The Dalles. And Lewis would not allow George Drouillard and
                  the Field brothers to shoot unarmed Piegans in the heat of the Two Medicine fray.
                  For most of the journey there was mutual respect born of expediency. That respect
                  and friendship was genuine nonetheless. Lewis and Clark left behind among many
                  Indians a legacy of nonviolent contact. Those who came later enjoyed that legacy
                  and too often betrayed it.</p>
               <p> If expedition-Indian personal relations were amiable, success did not come so
                  easily when Lewis and Clark ventured into diplomatic waters. Clark claimed that
                  the swivel gun he gave to the Hidatsa chief Le Borgne had spoken in thunder to
                  "all the nations we had seen."<ref target="n1004" n="4"/> But what the gun said
                  and how its report was answered depended on circumstances far beyond the
                  expedition's control. Lewis and Clark believed that official diplomacy was a
                  simple matter of rearranging Indian patterns to suit the needs of the new nation.
                  Proclaiming American sovereignty, establishing trade connections, and constituting
                  delegations to visit Jefferson all seemed goals within each reach. Who could deny
                  the rationality of intertribal peace or a united front against common enemies? But
                  when the captains sought to implement those policies, they met the often
                  unyielding realities of village and band politics. Lewis and Clark's
                  ill-considered attempt to forge a villager alliance against the Teton <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Sioux.xml"
                       rend="box">Sioux</ref> illustrates the depth of their ignorance. The explorers
                  comprehended neither river economics nor plains politics. In a world where "peace"
                  meant "truce" and where warriors fought one day and traded the next, Lewis and
                  Clark were simply unable and sometimes unwilling to face the facts of native
                  life.</p>
               <p> Lewis and Clark's Indian diplomacy failed in part because the explorers were
                  blind to those western facts of life. But the failure of the villager alliance and
                  the promises of intertribal peace extracted at so many councils came from
                  something more fundamental than naive optimism. What seemed failure for the
                  captains was often success for the chiefs. It was more than inept policy and
                  cultural arrogance that kept federal goals just out of reach. When Lewis and Clark
                  came into the West and Pacific Northwest, native political sovereignty and
                  autonomy were still potent realities. Men like Le Borgne, Cameahwait, and Broken
                  Arm enjoyed genuine power. They and their counselors could make decisions without
                  bowing to the dictates of faraway white fathers. Despite Lewis and Clark's
                  rhetoric, western Indians were not "our red children." Rather, they were mature
                  adults with a substantial measure of freedom to choose those parts of the American
                  program that best suited their own needs. Diplomacy during the journey was
                  ceremony and talk among equals, even if Lewis and Clark did not always recognize
                  that fact. If the captains failed to persuade the Indians to become children of a
                  distant father, it was because the Indians still had the power to accept American
                  guns whie rejecting less useful gifts.</p>
               <p> Bernard DeVoto once wrote that the records of the Lewis and Clark expedition
                  amounted to "the first detailed account of whatever length, of the western
                     tribes."<ref target="n1005" n="5"/> The ethnographic legacy has proven to be
                  one of Lewis and Clark's most durable contributions, although its value was not
                  plain at the time of the expedition. Guided by Jefferson's precise instructions
                  and their own curiosity, expedition ethnographers amassed a virtual library of
                  information about the Indians. Journal entries, vocabularies, drawings, maps,
                  artifacts, population estimates—all hold priceless knowledge about Indian
                  ways from the great river to the western sea. When Nicholas Biddle first examined
                  that ethnographic data, he felt some reason to apologize for its inadequacies.
                  "Those who first visit the ground," wrote the Philadelphian," can only be expected
                  to furnish sketches, rude and imperfect."<ref target="n1006" n="6"/> But Biddle's
                  evaluation missed the mark. The expedition gathered far more than "rude and
                  imperfect" records. In their writing, drawing, and collecting they managed to
                  capture an essential part of American life on the edge of profound change.</p>
               <p> In 1821 an obscure North West Company mariner named Peter Corney wrote, "By the
                  journey of Captains Lewis and Clark across the Rocky mountains to the Pacific
                  Ocean, the whole of that western region is now laid open."<ref target="n1007" n="7"/> It was more than rivers and mountains that were laid open to view.
                  Lewis and Clark were part of an expansionist movement that steadily brought
                  traders, bureaucrats, ranchers, and farmers into Mandan, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>, <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perce</ref>, and Chinookan homelands. "We were happy when he [the white
                  man] first came," explained the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flathead</ref> chief Charlot. "We first thought he came from the light; but
                  he comes like the dusk of evening now, not like the dawn of morning. He comes like
                  a day that has passed, and night enters our future with him."<ref target="n1008" n="8"/> But that night had not yet come in 1806. In tales repeated in lodge and
                  tepee, in the faces of children paler than their brothers and sisters, in
                  cherished flags and medals, and in individual memories now lost, Lewis and Clark
                  seemed part of the dawn. They appeared as the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> described them—"children of the Great Spirit" who
                  offered dazzling gifts. That the coming day would bring other, duller lights was a
                  scene not yet revealed to William Clark and Meriwether Lewis, much less to men
                  like Cameahwait and Yelleppit. Having shared a moment in history, each slipped
                  away to wonder about the fate of the other. </p>

            <div type="section">
               <p> Readers of this book will undoubtedly wonder why the most famous Indian
                  associated with the Lewis and Clark expedition is mentioned so infrequently. Over
                  the past century a powerful mythology has grown up, making extravagant claims for
                  Sacagawea as expedition guide and American heroine. Writers from Eva Emery Dye and
                  Grace R. Hebard to Donald Culross Peattie and Anna Lee Waldo have fashioned
                  narratives that go far beyond what can be known from reputable historical sources.
                  When evidence runs thin, many writers have been all too willing to pass off
                  fabrication for fact. Thus the claims still persist that Sacagawea single-handedly
                  guided the expedition through unknown lands to the Pacific and that she died an
                  old woman at Wind River, Wyoming in 1884. Such myths diminish Sacagawea and make a
                  balanced evaluation of her genuine contributions more difficult. More important,
                  they draw our attention away from those native men and women who made more
                  fundamental contributions to the expedition's success.</p>
               <p> What is reliably known about Sacagawea makes for only a brief biographical
                  sketch. Sometime in the fall of 1800, the young Lemhi <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> girl, then perhaps twelve or thirteen years old, was camped at
                  the Three Forks of the Missouri with others from her band. As so often happened to
                  northern <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> who ventured out on the plains to hunt buffalo, the
                  party at Three Forks was attacked by Hidatsa raiders. In the fighting that
                  followed, several <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> were killed. Among the prisoners taken were four boys and
                  several women, including Sacagawea. Sometime between 1800 and 1804, she and one
                  other <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> captive were purchased by Toussaint Charbonneau, a
                  trader with ties to the North West Company. When Lewis and Clark met Charbonneau
                  at Fort Mandan on November 4, 1804, the trader and his family were living at the
                  Awatixa Hidatsa village of Metaharta. Sacagawea was already pregnant and on
                  February 11, 1805, she gave birth to a son named Jean Baptiste. When Toussaint
                  Charbonneau was finally hired by Lewis and Clark as an interpreter, Sacagawea and
                  her chid became part of the Corps of Discovery.</p>
               <p> Three questions about Sacagawea have long fascinated Lewis and Clark scholars.
                  The name of the Indian woman—its meaning and proper spelling—continues
                  to spark considerable debate. Sacajawea, Sacagawea, and Sakakawea have all had
                  their partisans. The concern about spelling is not just a quibble over
                  orthography. If the woman's name was Sacajawea, the word might be <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>, meaning "boat launcher." However, if the spelling is more
                  properly Sacagawea, the name would be Hidatsa and translate as "Bird Woman." The
                  journal evidence from Lewis and Clark appears as to support a Hidatsa derivation.
                  On May 20, 1805, Lewis wrote: "Sah cagah we ah or bird woman's River" to name what
                  is now Crooked Creek in north-central Montana. The most effective arguments for a
                  Sacagawea spelling and a Hidatsa meaning are offered by Irving Anderson in his
                  "Sacajawea, Sacagawea, Sakakawea?" (<hi rend="italic">South Dakota History</hi> 8
                  [1978]:303–11). Anderson summarizes the previous literature and finds that
                  the Sacagawea spelling best fits both the historical and linguistic evidence.
                  However, it should be noted that an unpublished paper by Bob Saindon,
                  "'Sacajawea': The Origin and Meaning of a Name," does raise important questions
                  about the whole matter. Both Anderson and Saindon rely heavily on the findings of
                  professional linguists, who in turn differ considerably in their conclusions.
                  Along with the historian Donald Jackson, I have found the Sacagawea spelling most
                  acceptable.</p>
               <p> Far more important than the spelling and meaning of Sacagawea's name is the
                  nature and scope of her contributions to the expedition. Perhaps the most
                  persistent Lewis and Clark myth is that Sacagawea "guided" the party to the
                  Pacific. In countless statues, poems, paintings, and books she is depicted as a
                  westward-pointing pathfinder providing invaluable direction for bewildered
                  explorers. In the interest of correction, there has been a tendency to
                  underestimate Sacagawea's genuine achievements as a member of the Corps of
                  Discovery. Not as important as George Drouillard or John Ordway, the young woman
                  did make significant contributions to the expedition's success.</p>
               <p> Those contributions can be discussed under four heads. When the expedition left
                  Fort Mandan in April 1805, its most immediate need was to find the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> Indians and obtain horses for what was assumed would be an
                  easy mountain portage to Pacific waters. Lewis and Clark certainly believed that
                  Sacagawea would be of considerable value in the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> mission. They expected that she might recognize landmarks
                  along the route and would provide general information about the location of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> camps. When Sacagawea became ill at the Great Falls of the
                  Missouri, Lewis admitted, "This gave me some concern as well as for the poor
                  object herself, than with the young child in her arms, as from the consideration
                  of her being our only dependence for friendly negocition with the Snake
                     Indians."<ref target="n1101" n="1"/> But just what the captains expected from
                  her in those talks is not plain. For reasons that are now unclear, Sacagawea was
                  not included in Lewis's advance party that finally made contact with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshonis</ref> in August 1805. Good relations between the explorers and
                  Cameahwait depended far more on promises of guns and trades than on any
                  intercessions made by Sacagawea.</p>
               <p> Sacagawea was not an expedition guide in the usual sense of the word. When Lewis
                  and Clark needed to make a critical decision in early June 1805 about the true
                  channel of the Missouri, she took no part in the process. Much later, when the
                  expedition needed guides, men like Old Toby, Tetoharsky, and Twisted Hair were
                  hired for that duty. Only twice did Sacagawea provide what might be termed guide
                  services. In late July and early August 1805, she recognized important
                  geographical features on the way to find <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> camps. On the return journey in 1806, Sacagawea accompanied
                  Clark's party and provided the explorer with valuable information on what has
                  since been named Bozeman Pass. For most of the transcontinental journey, Sacagawea
                  was seeing country as new to her as it was to the captains. That she was not in
                  the lead making trail decisions does not diminish the fact that when she did
                  recognize a landmark, "this piece of information cheered the spirits of the
                     party."<ref target="n1102" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p> Success in many of the expedition's Indian missions depended on reliable
                  communication and translation. Both diplomacy and the collection of ethnographic
                  information demanded the sort of communication that George Drouillard's signs
                  could not always provide. One of Sacagawea's most important roles in the
                  expedition was that of translator, or as Clark quaintly put it, "interpretress
                  with the Snake Indians." She often worked as part of a long and cumbersome
                  translation chain that took each native word through many speakers before reaching
                  the captains. Sacagawea was able to continue those duties west of the Continental
                  Divide because of the presence of <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref> prisoners among groups that did not speak <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Shoshoni.xml"
                       rend="box">Shoshoni</ref>. Talks with the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Flathead.xml"
                       rend="box">Flatheads</ref> at Ross's Hole were conducted through such a prisoner, as
                  were those on the return journey with the Walulas and <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_NezPerce.xml"
                       rend="box">Nez Perces</ref>.</p>
               <p> The expedition also benefited from the physical presence of Sacagawea and her
                  child. Indians who might have thought the explorers part of a war party were
                  evidently reassured when they saw a woman and an infant in the group. Clark said
                  as much when he wrote, "The Wife of Shabono our interpreter We find reconsiles all
                  the Indians, as to our friendly intentions. A woman with a party of men is a token
                  of peace."<ref target="n1103" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p> If Sacagawea's life and accomplishments have been hotly debated, controversy has
                  also swirled around the date and place of her death. When Grace R. Hebard
                  published her <hi rend="italic">Sacajawea</hi> in 1933, she claimed that the
                  Indian woman had lived at Wind River, Wyoming, under the name Porivo until her
                  death in 1884. As Irving Anderson points out in his closely argued "Probing the
                  Riddle of the Bird Woman" (<hi rend="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western
                     History</hi> 23 [1973]: 2–17), Hebard's book misinterpreted some evidence
                  and neglected much more. Statements by William Clark and trader John C. Luttig
                  make it plain that Sacagawea died on December 20, 1812, at Fort Manuel in
                  present-day South Dakota. Most scholars now accept Clark's note in his Cash Book
                  that Sacagawea was dead by the 1825–28 period and Luttig's note—"this
                  Evening the wife of Charbonneau, a Snake Squaw, died of a putrid fever she was a
                  good and the best woman in the fort, aged abt 25 years"—as substantial
                  evidence for Sacagawea's early death.</p>
               <p> From the time of the expedition itself, Sacagawea has prompted strong opinions.
                  Lewis and Clark themselves wrote quite different evaluations of the woman and her
                  place in expedition history. Lewis, evidently unimpressed with her, declared, "If
                  she has enough to eat and a few trinkets I beleive she would be perfectly content
                     anywhere."<ref target="n1104" n="4"/> Clark did not share what seems the
                  ill-concealed contempt in those lines. He wrote to Toussaint Charbonneau after the
                  journey was over, "Your woman who accompanied you that long dangerous and
                  fatigueing rout to the Pacific Ocian and back diserved a greater reward for her
                  attention and services on that rout than we had in our power to give her at the
                     <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/lc.images_Mandan.xml"
                       rend="box">Mandans</ref>."<ref target="n1105" n="5"/> Clark's care for the
                  Charbonneau children after the expedition is yet another measure of his esteem for
                  their mother.</p>
               <p> Readers in search of a balanced treatment of Sacagawea might begin with Irving
                  Anderson, "Probing the Riddle of the Bird Woman," <hi rend="italic">Montana: The
                     Magazine of Western History</hi> 23 (1973): 2–17, and E. G. Chuinard,
                  "The Bird Woman: Purposeful Member of the Corps or Casual 'Tag-Along,'" <hi rend="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</hi> 26 (1976):
                  18–29. Also of considerable value are Irving Anderson, "A Charbonneau Family
                  Portrait," <hi rend="italic">American West</hi> 17 (1980): 4–13,
                  63–64; C. S. Kingston, "Sacajawea as a Guide—The Evaluation of a
                  Legend," <hi rend="italic">Pacific Northwest Quarterly</hi> 35 (1944): 2–18;

                  book-length treatment is Harold P. Howard, <hi rend="italic">Sacajawea</hi>
                  (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1971). Ella P. Clark and Margot Edmonds,
                     <hi rend="italic">Sacagawea</hi> (Berkeley: University of California Press,
                  1979) must be read with caution since it uncritically accepts the notion of a
                  Sacagawea who lived into the 1880s. Recent novels about Sacagawea, including Anna
                  Lee Waldo, <hi rend="italic">Sacajawea</hi> (New York: Avon Books, 1979) must be
                  read as fiction, not history. Their claims to historical accuracy are dubious at
                  best and misleading at worst. </p>

                  focused on questions of diplomacy and progress upriver, William Clark did record
                  valuable data about Yankton life. Clark noted Sioux dress, weapons, and musical
                  instruments. He filled in a vocabulary form and wrote a long description of the
                  important warrior societies that gave shape to the lives of Sioux males. From
                  Pierre Dorion, Clark obtained a useful list of the Sioux bands. See Thw.

                  should take precedence over a chief from any of the other villages. Since Tabeau
                  and Gravelines had close ties to Kakawita and Kakawissassa, it is possible that
                  the Frenchmen influenced the decision.</note>

                  by Thomas J. Farnham in 1839 at Brown's Hole. The information was given to Farnham
                  by a Shoshoni who claimed to have been the man seen by Lewis on August 11. Much of
                  this account does not square with events recorded by Lewis. Thomas J. Farnham,

                  Cayuses.</note>

                  Indians, especially "the crafty Chinook Concomly," knowingly kept from the
                  expedition knowledge of the presence of the brig <hi rend="italic">Lydia.</hi> See

                  from captivity at Nootka Sound, indicates that the ship entered the Columbia at an
                  unspecified date and its crew learned that Lewis and Clark had left Fort Clatsop
                  some two weeks before. Thwaites believed that the <hi rend="italic">Lydia</hi> was
                  on the Columbia before mid-March 1806, an assumption not based on any evidence in
                  Jewitt's account, which is very unclear on dates. However, there seems no reason
                  to doubt Jewitt's two-week information. Equally significant, there is no reason
                  for the Chinookans to keep this sort of information from Lewis and Clark. See
