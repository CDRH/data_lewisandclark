               </hi>2004 98 [4]: 270–82.)</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1789 when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>, then a nineteen-year-old
        militiaman, first laid eyes on the settlement of 
        <name type="place" key="Vincennes in the Norhtwest Territory">Vincennes in the Northwest
        Territory</name>, he encountered a frontier society far different from the one he knew and
        understood. A Virginian by birth, the young Kentuckian was unimpressed with what he saw. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Billy</name>, as the Clark family called him,
        wrote in his journal: "Post Vincennes is a old and starved place the howses bas[e] but
        clean . . . low and bilt after the French fasion. I was astonished at seeing so larg[e]
        and old a Town without any Settlement round."
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0101" n="1"/>Clearly unaware that the communal French Creoles
        favored village life and common fields over the scattered settlements and individual
        farmsteads so familiar to him, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had much to learn. In time he would
        become well acquainted with French ways and customs, but for the moment they seemed
        strange and different to the youthful Anglo-American.</p>
            <p>After he joined the regular army, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s duties periodically took him to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Knox">Fort Knox</name>, a U.S. military post at Vincennes.
        During his deployment there in the winter of 1793–1794, the congenial townspeople saw to
        it that the young American lieutenant was included on their guest lists for social
        occasions–no doubt in part because he was the younger brother of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, George Rogers">George Rogers Clark</name>, whom many of
        them had come to know during the course of his western campaigns during the American
        Revolutionary War. The Creoles surely reminded their young American friend of the support
        they had rendered in that conflict, and he in turn may have shared stories about his
        brother 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, John">John</name>'s brief service with the 
        <name type="person" key="Marquis de Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</name>'s forces during
        the war's final Virginia campaign. For 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>the succession of balls and
        card games in Vincennes provided a welcome respite from the boredom and fatigue of army
        life. Never one to pass on a party, he was warming up to the French and their ways even as
        his fondness for the military life momentarily waned.

            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>resigned his commission in the U.S.
        Army in July 1796 in search of what he once referred to as "some more honourable
        imployment for my youthful days."
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0103" n="3"/>He had confided to his brother 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, Edmund">Edmund</name>that the possibilities for opening an
        extensive and successful trade on the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</name>seemed especially
        promising.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0104" n="4"/>Not long after returning to civilian life, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>found himself back in the
        French settlement on the 
        <name type="place" key="Wabash River">Wabash River</name>representing his older brother 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, George">George</name>in a lawsuit that threatened the
        family's 
        <name type="place" key="Indiana">Indiana</name>landholdings. After conferring with local
        authorities, the younger 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>traveled on to 
        <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia">Kaskaskia</name>in pursuit of documents that he
        believed might buttress his brother's defense. While there he took time to reconnoiter the

        <name type="place" key="Ste. Genevieve">Ste. Genevieve</name>,

        acquaintance for any young man of business with ambitions in that part of the world.

        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>, where on September 10,
        1797, he first glimpsed the city that he would call home during the final thirty years of
        his life. The Creole settlement with its well-built homes and commanding view of the 
        <name type="person" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>was already a major entrepôt
        of the western fur trade.</p>

        bilingual brother-in-law, trader

        Americans and to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, George Rogers">George Rogers Clark</name>, welcomed the
        young Kentuckian to Upper Louisiana's thriving capital with the same gracious hospitality
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had come to consider a mark of French
        character.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0106" n="6"/>

            <p>After supping with the Spanish lieutenant governor, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>attended a ball at the residence of 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre Chouteau</name>, where he saw "all the
        fine girls and buckish Gentleman" and once again experienced the French 
        <hi rend="italic">joie de vivre</hi>with the amiable 
        <name type="person" key="Gratiot, Charles">Gratiot</name>serving as his interpreter and
        host. One may surmise that the conversation that evening was animated, the company
        enjoyable, and the libations plentiful, for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not retire to the 
        <name type="person" key="Gratiot, Charles">Gratiot</name>home until the wee hours of the
        following morning. Such was 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>'s formal entrée into the
        world of Upper 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>'s French Creoles.

            </p>
            <p>Six years later 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had an opportunity to renew old
        acquaintances in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis">St. Louis</name>when he and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>arrived in the western
        country to complete preparations for their Pacific expedition. Lieutenant Governor

        American exploring party to enter Spanish territory without the approval of his superiors
        in 
        <name type="place" key="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</name>forced 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to abandon their plan for
        establishing a winter camp on the 
        <name type="placee" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>. They chose instead a
        location on the eastern side of the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>across from the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>at 
        <name type="place" key="Wood River">Wood River</name>, or as the French called it, the 
        <name type="person" key="Wood River">Riviere du Bois</name>.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0108" n="8"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Delassus, Charles">Delassus</name>may not have been
        accommodating, but the same could not be said for most of Upper 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>'s other francophone residents. When 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s little fleet sailed up the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>on its way to 
        <name type="place" key="Wood River">Wood River</name>, proudly flying the American colors,
        
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>reported that as it approached 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>"the admiration of the people
        were So great, that hundreds Came to the bank to view us." The captains ordered the boats
        to drop anchor along the riverfront so they could briefly pay their respects in the
        capital city. During a courtesy call at the lieutenant governor's residence, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>encountered several former
        acquaintances. Whatever reservations they may have harbored about the pending American
        takeover of 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>, the Creoles seemed eager to make a
        positive impression on the young officers.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0109" n="9"/>
            </p>
            <p>In private conversations out of the governor's hearing, 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste">Auguste Chouteau</name>and Upper 
        <name type="person" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>'s surveyor general, 
        <name type="person" key="Soulard, Antoine">Antoine Soulard</name>, exhibited a surprising
        willingness to be helpful. 
        <name type="person" key="Soulard, Antoine">Soulard</name>allowed 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>to peruse his copy of Upper 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>'s 1800 census, and 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste">Chouteau</name>loaned him a manuscript map
        depicting the 
        <name type="person" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>as far as the mouth of the
        Osage.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0110" n="10"/>Their tacit cooperation fostered the creation of a
        cordial relationship between 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and Upper 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>'s francophones. The pragmatic Creoles,
        apprehensive about their prospects under a new American regime, exhibited remarkable
        adaptability as they braced themselves for the necessary adjustments to the requirements
        of an alien culture, government, and language. As gentlemen renowned for their
        conviviality and as businessmen with an eye on the future, 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>'s French-speaking merchants
        and traders wasted no time in extending the hand of friendship to the incoming
        Americans.</p>
            <p>During their stay at 
        <name type="place" key="Camp River Dubois">Camp River Dubois</name>, which extended from
        December 1803 to May 1804, both 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>often traveled to 
        <name type="person" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>, where they passed many
        pleasant hours in the comfortable homes of the 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste and Pierre">Chouteau</name>brothers. The
        foursome got along famously, notwithstanding their need to rely on translators to
        facilitate their conversations. Neither 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>nor 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>spoke French, and the 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste and Pierre">Chouteaus</name>were not fluent in
        English. 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste">Auguste</name>, the quieter, more calculating,
        and less outgoing of the 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau">Chouteaus</name>, somewhat resembled 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>in his demeanor and deportment,
        whereas the more extroverted 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre</name>and the easygoing and affable 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>seem to have been kindred
        spirits.</p>
            <p>Though the linguistic and cultural divide that separated the French Creoles and the
        Americans was deep, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and the 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste and Pierre">Chouteau</name>brothers soon
        discovered that they also had much in common. As seasoned veterans of frontier life, they
        shared mutual interests in Native American peoples and natural history. None had attended
        an institution of higher learning, but they were well educated and knowledgeable about
        many things. Ambitious and eager to achieve economic success, they also enjoyed the
        benefits and advantages of social standing within their respective communities.</p>
            <p>The 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste and Pierre">Chouteau</name>gentility and
        gracious hospitality favorably impressed both 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Besides providing a welcome
        diversion from camp life, the visits also gave them an opportunity to learn more about the
        immense trans-
        <name type="person" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>territory they were
        preparing to traverse. The Frenchmen used these get-togethers to acquaint 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>with their personal views on matters
        ranging from appropriate forms of government—they preferred a military one—to Indian
        policy. They also took advantage of their ripening friendships to strike bargains for the
        sale of merchandise to outfit the upcoming expedition. The 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste and Pierre">Chouteaus</name>' renown as
        businessmen and their vast experience in dealing with the 
        <name type="person" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>tribes made them excellent
        advisers.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0111" n="11"/>
            </p>
            <p>The frequency of these contacts increased in mid-February when 
        <name type="person" key="Delassus, Charles">Delassus</name>received orders to proceed with
        the region's transfer to U.S. authorities. At the lieutenant governor's invitation,
        Captains 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>joined Spanish officials for an
        inspection tour of the local military fortifications, which 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>judged to be in a wretched state.
        According to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the outgoing Spanish official
        received Captain 
        <name type="person" key="Stoddard, Amos">Amos Stoddard</name>, the incoming American
        commandant, with a great deal of formality and parade.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0112" n="12"/>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was likely present in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis">St. Louis</name>to observe the ceremonies of transfer
        on March 9 and 10, 1804, during which 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>signed the official transfer
        document as a witness.</p>
            <p>When

        off. As the French Creoles mingled freely with the Anglo-Americans on the 
        <name type="person" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>riverbank, the expedition's
        departure symbolized the beginning of a long and successful partnership uniting the old
        French inhabitants and the American newcomers in a common effort to develop the trans-

            <p>It was hardly surprising that upon their return twenty-eight months later, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>picked up where they had left off.
        When they put ashore in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>on September 23, 1806, an
        impromptu crowd lining the riverbank shouted its approval. On their first day back, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>recorded in his journal: "We accepted
        of the invitation of Mr. 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Peter Chouteau</name>and took a room in his

        friends this evening," where no doubt they regaled the St. Louisans with tales of their
        experiences during their lengthy absence.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0117" n="17"/>Two days later St. Louisans feted the expedition's
        leaders with a sumptuous dinner and ball at 
        <name type="person" key="William Christy's Tavern">William Christy's Tavern</name>, during
        which the happy revelers drank no fewer than eighteen toasts.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0118" n="18"/>For 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre Chouteau</name>the occasion was doubly
        enjoyable because, at the invitation of the U.S. government, he was preparing to join the
        American explorers on their trek eastward for his second trip to the national capital.
        Neither 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>nor 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>knew that 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>was about to become his new

            <p>Once the applause died away, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>appointed

        <name type="person" key="Wilkinson, James">James Wilkinson</name>as governor of the 
        <name type="person" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>Territory, and he named

        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the association with

        but for

            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, who had been reluctant to accept

        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>to take up his duties and to
        assist the incoming territorial secretary, 
        <name type="person" key="Bates, Frederick">Frederick Bates</name>, a Virginian with a

        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, who genuinely liked and respected
        Upper

        <name type="person" key="Bates, Frederick">Bates</name>confided in a letter to his brother
        
        <name type="person" key="Bates, Richard">Richard</name>: "The very name of liberty
        deranges their [the Creoles'] intellects, and it appears absolutely impossible for them to

            <p>When 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>returned to 
        <name type="person" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>in early May 1807, the
        French Creoles must have considered him a welcome antidote to the acerbic 
        <name type="person" key="Bates, Frederick">Bates</name>. In his attempts to counter the
        growing British influence among Upper 
        <name type="placee" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>'s Indian tribes and to shore up the
        territory's inadequate defenses, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not hesitate to solicit advice
        from his francophone friends. But an affair of the heart soon called 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>back to 
        <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>, where early the next year he married 
        <name type="person" key="Hancock, Julia">Judith (Julia) Hancock</name>, in whose honor he
        named a scenic 
        <name type="person" key="Montana">Montana</name>stream the 
        <name type="place" key="Judith River, Montana">Judith River</name>. When the newlyweds
        arrived in 
        <name type="person" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>to set up housekeeping the
        following June, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had seen to it that all was in
        readiness for the couple.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0120" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter the governor dispatched his friend 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>to negotiate with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name>Indians and to supervise the
        construction of a combined trading factory and military outpost, first called 
        <name type="person" key="Fort Clark">Fort Clark</name>, but later known as 
        <name type="person" key="Fort Osage">Fort Osage</name>. Those negotiations led to one of
        the few serious disagreements between 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and the 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste and Pierre">Chouteaus</name>, and it
        momentarily threatened to dissolve their developing alliance. When the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osages</name>came to 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>to protest the terms of the
        treaty they had signed in his presence, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>blamed 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre Chouteau</name>for having instigated
        their defiance in order to solidify his personal trading interests with the tribe. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>remained undecided
        about 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Chouteau</name>'s role in the proceedings, but
        he noted that the affair had produced "a want of cordiality and confidence" between 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Chouteau</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0121" n="21"/>
            </p>
            <p>Their misunderstanding was soon set aside, perhaps over a few drinks and a friendly
        game of whist. Relations between 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre Chouteau</name>were sufficiently
        improved later in the year to enable them to join together with

        <name type="person" key="Menard, Pierre">Pierre Menard</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Reuben">Reuben Lewis</name>(
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether</name>'s brother), 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre</name>'s son 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste Pierre">Auguste Pierre</name>, and several
        others to establish a new business venture—the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company. In all
        likelihood 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was also a silent partner. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>brought to the enterprise sound
        judgment, a reputation for integrity, and the possible benefits he might be able to bestow
        in his official capacity—assets his partners deemed equally valuable to a large capital
        stake. As a sign of their trust and confidence in the methodical 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, they made him the company's agent
        in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>and assigned him to take care
        of its books. Throughout his public career, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>worked to promote the fur trade, and
        that support further cemented his relationship with the St. Louis Creoles who continued to
        dominate the business. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s control over the issuance of U.S.
        trading licenses did not lessen the value of his friendship.</p>
            <p>Governor 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s decision to pay the new company
        $7,000 to escort the stranded

        <name type="place" key="Washington, D. C.">Washington</name>and was one of several factors
        that plunged the already despondent official into a still deeper despair, leading him to
        take his own life in the fall of 1809. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s tragic death was a blow to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>who continued to live in

            <p>The management of Indian affairs was one of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s primary concerns during his 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>years. As historian 
        <name type="person" key="Buckley, Jay">Jay Buckley</name>has demonstrated, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was arguably the federal government's
        most important representative in deliberations with Indians in western America. He
        personally negotiated thirty-seven Indian treaties, more by far than any other U.S.
        official, and he never hesitated to look to Creole leaders for advice when it came to
        matters of Indian diplomacy. It was no mere coincidence that 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste">Auguste Chouteau</name>assisted with
        twenty-six of the Indian treaties that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>helped arrange.

            <p>Following 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s death, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s political fortunes in the frontier
        territory were momentarily in the ascendancy. In 1813, President 
        <name type="person" key="Madison, James">James Madison</name>appointed him governor of the
        
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>Territory—an office he retained until 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>became a state. During his tenure as
        governor, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>presided over a frontier territory
        where personal feuds and animosities frequently exacerbated disagreements over public
        policy. In the rough-and-tumble arena of 
        <name type="person" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>territorial politics, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>generally sided with members of the
        <name type="person" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>junto, an elite group of
        leaders dominated by influential French fur merchants and land claimants with substantial
        holdings in unconfirmed Spanish land titles.

            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was not averse to using his
        gubernatorial office to assist old friends and allies as well as family members. In one
        celebrated incident, over the strenuous objections of backers of the struggling Bank of
        St. Louis, he exercised his political muscle to secure legislative approval for chartering
        the rival Bank of Missouri headed by 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Auguste">Auguste Chouteau</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>later became a shareholder and
        officer in the new institution. His open identification with the city's Creole
        establishment eventually proved costly in 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>'s rapidly changing political climate.
        Rightly or wrongly, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s loyalty to longtime friends and
        members of the territorial establishment, coupled with his belief that their support
        served the national interest, guided his political choices. Ultimately his close
        association with individuals representing the old order proved to be a serious political
        liability that contributed to his defeat in the contest to elect 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>'s first governor following
        statehood.</p>
            <p>During the gubernatorial campaign, the opposition portrayed 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>as a stiff, reserved 
        <name type="person" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>aristocrat who had been far too cozy
        with the Indians.

        <name type="person" key="McNair, Alexander">Alexander McNair</name>, by the droves, but 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s Creole friends remained steadfast
        in their support. In a letter published in the 
        <hi rend="italic">St. Louis Enquirer</hi>only in French, the author, who signed himself a
        Louisianan, reminded 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>'s francophones that during the War of
        1812 when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s predecessor, Governor 
        <name type="person" key="Howard, Benjamin">Benjamin Howard</name>, had accused them of
        favoring the savages over the government, their longtime friend had rushed to their
        defense and unequivocally vouched for their loyalty.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0126" n="26"/>Unfortunately for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the overwhelming support he enjoyed
        among the old French inhabitants was insufficient to counter the influence of the state's
        burgeoning Anglo-American majority, and 
        <name type="person" key="McNair, Alexander">McNair</name>handily trounced him by a margin
        of nearly three-to-one.</p>
            <p>Though disappointed, the steadfast 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>took his loss in stride and turned
        his attention to the practical need for securing employment, preferably in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>. His friends in the national
        government obliged by continuing him in his position as U.S. Indian agent, and in 1822
        they gave him the title of superintendent of Indian affairs at 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s power and political influence may
        have been waning, and many of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s rank-and-file 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>constituents may have long since
        consigned his exploits as an explorer to the dustbin of history, but he still retained a
        modicum of fame. Distinguished guests visiting the West routinely called on 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, who delighted in showing them his
        museum filled with Indian artifacts and other curiosities. A notable example was the 
        <name type="person" key="Marquis de Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</name>, who made it a
        point during his brief 1825 stopover in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</name>to see 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and visit his museum.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0127" n="27"/>Their cordial meeting helped offset any
        embarrassment resulting from 
        <name type="person" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>Governor 
        <name type="person" key="Bates, Frederick">Frederick Bates</name>'s refusal to receive the
        visiting French dignitary, and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>subsequently sent him a live grizzly
        bear that became something of a sensation following its delivery in Paris.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0128" n="28"/>Prophetically, five years earlier in the heat of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s unsuccessful 1820 gubernatorial
        campaign, a staunch Creole partisan had reminded his fellow francophones that Monsieur 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had never forgotten 
        <name type="person" key="Marquis de Lafayette">Lafayette</name>'s assistance during the
        Revolutionary War or the role that French forces had played at Yorktown.
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0129" n="29"/>
            </p>
            <p>It was fitting that in his final years 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>shared honors as St. Louis's elder
        statesman with 
        <name type="person" key="Chouteau, Pierre">Pierre Chouteau</name>. A friendship and
        alliance born many years before persisted to the end. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s 1820 campaign statement addressed
        to the people of 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>perhaps best summarized his Creole
        connection: "I came to this country, then Upper 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>, in the fall of 1803, before the
        change of government, in company with the expedition which was planned by 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Mr. Jefferson</name>and led by the late
        governor, then Captain 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific ocean</name>. On the return of that
        expedition I made 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>the home of my choice and the country of
        my permanent residence. This long residence has given me a personal acquaintance, which
        time has ripened into friendship, with most of the old inhabitants and early settlers: and
        to them I refer [you] for answers to any enquiries which may concern my individual and
        private character."
        <ref target="nlc.foley.0130" n="30"/>To 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s way of thinking, they knew him as
