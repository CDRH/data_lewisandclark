               <p>This morning the fishing and hunting parties
          <ref target="n28030601" n="1"/>set out agreeably to their instructions given them last
          evening.    at 11 A. M. we were visited by 
          <name type="person" key="Coboway">Comowoll</name>and two of his children.   
          he presented us with some Anchovies which had been well cured in their manner.
             we foud them excellent.    they were very acceptable particularly
          at this moment.    we gave the old man some small articles in return.
             this we have found much the most friendly and decent savage that we have
          met with in this neighbourhood. Hall had his foot and ankle much injured yesterday by
          the fall of a large stick of timber; the bones were fortunately not broken and I expect
          he will be able to walk again shortly. 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>is now weaker than any of
          the convalessants, all of whom recover slowly in consequence of the want of proper diet,
          which we have it not in our power to procure.—

               <p>This morning, the fishing and hunting party's Set out agreeably to their instructions
          given them last evening. At 11 a. m. we were visited by

          he presented us with Some Anchovies which had been well Cured in their manner, we found
          them excellent.    they were very acceptable perticularly at this moment.
             we gave the old mans Sones a twisted wire to ware about his neck, and I
          gave him a par of old glovs which he was much pleased with.    this we have
          found much the most friendly and decent Indian that we have met with in this
          neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Hall had his foot and ankle much injured yesterday by the fall of a log which he had
          on his Sholder; the bones are fortunately not broken, I expect he will be able to walk

          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratten</name>is now weaker than any of

          passed and are the Same with those of the U, States.    the fishing hawk is
          not abundant, particularly in the mountains. There are 4 Species of the larus or gull on
          this coast and river.    1st a Small Species the Size of a Pegion;
          <ref target="n28030603" n="3"/>white except some black spots about the head and the
          little bone on the but of the wing.    2d a Species Somewhat larger of a light
          brown colour, with a mealy coloured back.
          <ref target="n28030604" n="4"/>   3rd the large Grey Gull,
          <ref target="n28030605" n="5"/>or white larus with a greyish brown back, and light grey
          belly and breast, about the Size of a well grown pullet, the wings are remarkably long
          in perpotion to the Size of the body and it's under chap towards the extremity is
          gibbous and protuberant than in either of the other Species.    a

          adjoining the head and on the base of the upper Chap there is an elivated orning of the
          Same Substance with the beak which forms the nostriels at A; it is Somewhat in this
          form.
          <ref target="n28030607" n="7"/>   the feet are webed and the legs and feet of

          were sent out in different directions to hunt, and three more were sent to endeavour to
          procure some fish, as the natives take a great number of the small fish about 20 miles
          distant from the fort by water. Some men were also employed in repairing the canoes,
          that we may be able to set out on our return immediately, should our hunters be
          unsuccessful. The elk, almost the only game in this part of the country, are chiefly
          gone to the mountains. This day continued fair throughout.</p>
