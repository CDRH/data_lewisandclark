               <p>The wind blew so hard this morning that we delayed untill 8 A. M. we gave a medal of
          small size to a man by the name of 
          <name type="person" key="Waláli">Wal-lal'-le</name>,
          <ref target="n31032601" n="1"/>a principal man among the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Cathlamet Indians">Cathlahmahs</name>, he appeared very
          thankfull for the honour conferred on him and presented us a large sturgeon.
             we continued our rout up the river to an old village on the Stard. side
          where we halted for dinner.
          <ref target="n31032602" n="2"/>   we met on the way the principal Cheif of
          the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Cathlamet Indians">Cathlahmahs</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Sax̣awaq̓ap">Sâh-hâh-wôh-cap</name>,
          <ref target="n31032603" n="3"/>who had been up the river on a trading voyage.
             he gave us some Wappetoe and fish; we also purchased some of the latter.
             soon after we halted for dinner the two 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Wahkiakum Indians">Wackiacums</name>who have been
          pursuing us since yesterday morning with two dogs for sale, arrived.    they
          wish tobacco in exchange for their dogs which we are not disposed to give as our stock
          is now reduced to a very few carrots.
          <ref target="n31032604" n="4"/>   our men who have been accustomed to the use
          of this article Tobaco and to whom we are now obliged to deny the uce of this article
          appear to suffer much for the want of it.    they substitute the bark of the
          wild crab which they chew; it is very bitter, and they assure me they find it a good
          substitute for tobacco. the smokers substitute the inner bark of the red willow and the
          sacacommis.
          <ref target="n31032605" n="5"/>   here our hunters joined us having killed
          three Eagles and a large goose. I had now an oportunity of comparing the bald with the
          grey Eagle;
          <ref target="n31032606" n="6"/>I found that the greay Eagle was about ¼ larger, it's
          legs and feet were dark while those of the bald Eagle wer of a fine orrange yellow; the
          iris of the eye is also of a dark yellowish brown while that of the other is of a bright
          silvery colour with a slight admixture of yellow.    after dinner we proceeded
          on and passed an Elegant and extensive bottom on the South side and an island near it's
          upper point which we call 
          <name type="place" key="Crims (Fanny's) Island">Fanny's Island</name>and bottom.
          <ref target="n31032607" n="7"/>   the greater part of the bottom is a high
          dry prarie.    near the river towards the upper point we saw a fine grove of
          whiteoak trees;
          <ref target="n31032608" n="8"/>we saw some deer and Elk at a distance in the prarie,
          but did not delay for the purpose of hunting them.    we continued our rout
          after dinner untill late in the evening and encamped on the next island above 
          <name type="place" key="Crims (Fanny's) Island">fanny's Island</name>.
          <ref target="n31032609" n="9"/>   we found it difficult to obtain as much
          wood as answered our purposes.    the hunters
          <ref target="n31032610" n="10"/>who had proceeded on before us after dinner did not
          join us this evening.    some indians visited us after dark, but did not
          remain long.    agreeably to our estimate as we decended the river, we came 16
          m. 23rd, 16 m. the 24th, 15 the 25th, and 18 m. the 26th, tho' I now think that our
          estimate in decending the river was too short.</p>
