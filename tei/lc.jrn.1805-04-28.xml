Set out this morning at an early hour; the wind was favourable and we employed our sails to advantage. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> walked on shore this morning,<ref target="n12042801" n="1"/> and I proceeded with the party.    the country through which we passed today is open as usual and very broken on both sides near the river hills, the bottoms are level fertile and partially covered with timber.    the hills and bluffs exhibit their usual mineral appearances, some birnt hills but no appearance of Pumicestone; coal is in great abundance and the salts still increase in quantity; the banks of the river and sandbars are incrusted with it in many places and appear perfectly white as if covered with snow or frost.—<ref target="n12042802" n="2"/>    the woods are now green, tho' the plains and meadows appear to abate of the verdure those below exhibited some days past.    we past three small runs today.    two falling in on the Stard. and one on the Lard. side,<ref target="n12042803" n="3"/> they are but small afford but little water and head a few miles back in the hills.  we saw great quantities of game today; consisting of the common and mule deer, Elk, Buffaloe, and Antelopes; also four brown bear, one of which was fired on and wounded by one of the party but we did not get it; the beaver have cut great quantities of timber; saw a tree nearly 3 feet in diameter that had been felled by them. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> in the course of his walk killed a deer and a goose; &amp; saw three black bear; he thinks the bottoms are not so wide as they have been for some days past.—</p>

The Antilopes are nearly red, on that part which is Subject to change i' e' the Sides &amp; ⅔ of the back from the head, the other part as white as Snow, 2 Small runs fall in on the S. Side and one this evening on the Lard Side those runs head at a fiew miles in the hills and discharge but little water, the Bluffs in this part as also below Shew different Straturs of Coal or carbonated wood, and Coloured earth, such as dark brown, yellow a lightish brown, &amp; a dark red &amp;c.</p>

Sunday April 28th    This day we had fine clear weather &amp; pleasant, we set out Early in the morning; and proceeded on till 9 o'Clock A.

and that the Sand barrs, lay generally in the middle of this River; The land as we passed along, appears to lay more level than what we had passed for several days past, but very Rich &amp; fertile    We encamped in the Evening, in a handsome bottom, on which there was Cotton wood Trees growing.—    The bottoms are not so large in general here, as below, and the Timber not so plenty.—    We came 24 Miles this day &amp; the place we encamp'd on 〈lies〉 lay on the South side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">River Mesouri</name>.—</p>
