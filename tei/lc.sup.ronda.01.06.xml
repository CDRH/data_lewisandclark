On a windy day in early April 1805, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name> surveyed the Corps of Discovery and its "little fleet" of canoes and pirogues, and declared that the expedition was ready "to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width, on which the foot of civilized man had never trodden." The long months at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

The journey up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and on to <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name> necessitated travel through territories frequented by Indians that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> believed were hostile to an American presence.

But <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> always understood that they were more than mere travelers making a grand western tour at government expense. They went west as diplomats and agents of an American empire. Proclaiming United States sovereignty, establishing intertribal peace, and promoting trade with American merchants were unchanging objectives of the expedition. Symbolizing those goals was an unnamed <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> man who went along with the expedition when it left on April 7. He was on board, explained <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, "with a view to restore peace between the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake Indians</name> and those in this neighbourhood."<ref target="n0604" n="4"/> Although the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> peace emissary decided two days later not to hazard the journey, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> were still committed to the policies toward the Indians they had promoted from the outset.</p>

In the weeks that followed the departure from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N.

Busy navigating the twists and turns of the river channel, they had little time to notice how few Indians were to be seen.

               <p>
For the rest of May and well into June, the expedition's energies were taken up in navigating the river through the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Breaks of the">Missouri Breaks</name>. Although the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Breaks of the">Breaks</name> and the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, White Cliffs of the">White Rocks</name> region offered what <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> poetically described as "seens of visionary inchantment," there was little time to appreciate such natural wonders. Sandbars, rapids, and falling banks made the task of pulling boats against the current ever more demanding. Struggling toward the <name type="place" key="Judith River">Judith River</name>, the explorers continued to note "strong evidences of Indians being on the river above us, and probably at no great distance."<ref target="n0610" n="10"/> More deserted stick lodges, a tepee pole that bore signs of use as part of a travois, and other native goods were steady reminders of the crowded wilderness. On May 29, at the <name type="place" key="Judith River">Judith River</name>, there were two vivid marks of Indian life. Walking along the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> at a point just above the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Judith River">Judith</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> counted the fires of 126 recently occupied tepees.

If the moccasins were visual signs of Indian life along the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, the powerful stench of rotting buffalo carcasses was an equally potent reminder of the native presence. Although recent archaeological studies by W. Raymond Wood have indicated that the route of travel for May 29 did not pass a buffalo jump, the mass of buffalo remains did prompt <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> to write a detailed description of a <hi rend="italic">pishkun</hi> or jump and the dangerous techniques used by Indians to lure animals over the edge.<ref target="n0611" n="11"/>

By the time <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his advance party reached the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the Missouri</name> on June 13, 1805, the expedition had been traveling for over two months, and once past the <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name> there had been no encounters with Indians.

But as the explorers labored over the grueling <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> portage, the captains thought increasingly about finding <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Shoshoni.html"

                  </ref> horses. Their growing concern can be measured by an important decision made during the portage. Earlier in the journey, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had given some thought to sending one canoe and a few men back to <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> from the falls carrying news of the party.

The first week of August 1805 must have seemed an eternity to the frustrated and exhausted men of the expedition. Everything that could go awry did. Laboring up the <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name> in a channel that was barely navigable, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> boat crews slipped in the mud, tripped over hidden rocks, and spent hours waist-deep in cold water.

When the two captains again joined forces on August 6 and proceeded up the <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>, they had to face some harsh realities. Several men, including <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>, were injured and in pain, while many others were near exhaustion. Valuable trade goods, medicine, and powder were wet and damaged. Food supplies were uncertain. And above all, there was the inescapable fact that unless the expedition found horses very soon it would have to pack only a fraction of its supplies across the divide and look for a place to winter in mountains known for their scarcity of game. The men's spirits and prospects would not be as low again until the bitter days in the snows of the <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>.</p>
               <p>

Known to Indians as the <name type="place" key="Beaverhead Rock">Beaver's Head</name> because it reminded them of a swimming beaver, the rock brought both hope and a sense of urgency to the expedition. "As it is now all important with us to meet those people as soon as possible," the captains decided to once again send <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> on ahead with <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>, <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">Hugh McNeal</name>, and <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> vowed to find horses if it took a month of hard travel.<ref target="n0622" n="22"/> On the next morning, August 9, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his men swung on their packs and began to follow the <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson River</name> toward the mountains.

All day on August 9, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his men tracked along the <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>.

Because the path also forked and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> did not want to waste time on the wrong trail, he dispatched <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> up one way while <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name> took the other. Sensing that this fork also marked the end of navigable waters, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> left a note for <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> telling him to go no further until the advance party returned. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and his men now set out along <name type="place" key="Horse Prairie Creek (West Fork Jefferson River)">Horse Prairie Creek</name>, a small stream that flowed from the West. <name type="place" key="Horse Prairie Creek (West Fork Jefferson River)">Horse Prairie Creek</name> led the explorers into <name type="place" key="Shoshone Cove">Shoshoni Cove</name>, described by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> as one of the "handsomest" coves he had ever seen.

What should have been a pleasant reunion between <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> on August 16 proved instead to be a day filled with tension, fear, and deception.

Thinking that they were now the hunted quarry, two groups of Indians rode off down the cove to shadow <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>. It was not a good way to begin the day, and things soon became even more tense. As <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> made their way down through the cove, one of the Indian scouts came riding up the plain at full whip. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> first thought was that by "some unfortunate accident" a hostile war party was in the neighborhood and had been confused with the main expedition group. All fears were quickly allayed when the <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Shoshoni.html"

As hungry Indians ate the uncooked meat, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> took note that the fear of possible ambush had reduced the caravan to no more than twenty-eight men and three women. Since the women were expected to play the porter role, his count was not reassuring.</p>
               <p>
With the bloody meal over, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> carefully explained to <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> just where the main body of the expedition would be encountered. The chief replied by placing skin tippets or mantles around the necks of the Americans.

And he had no intention of allowing the expedition's desires to thwart the needs of his people. All of this became plain as <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> entered <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait's</name>
                  <name type="place" key="Lemhi (East Fork Lewis's) River">Lemhi River</name> village on August 20.

First, the explorer needed geographical information. The future of the expedition now depended on finding a practical route to western waters, whether that path required horses or canoes. <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> listened intently to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> request for directions and then constructed a detailed relief map depicting the <name type="place" key="Lemhi (East Fork Lewis's) River">Lemhi</name>, <name type="place"

               <p>
That was just the sort of news <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was looking for, but he was not yet prepared to decide that this northwestern route was the most acceptable.

On August 24, after some delays, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> finally moved out of <name type="place" key="Camp Fortunate (Mont.)">Camp Fortunate</name>.

He forcefully reminded the chiefs of all their promises to aid the expedition across the divide and on to western waters. Not content to challenge their honor, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> resorted to a direct threat. "If they wished the whitemen to be their friends," he declared, "and to assist them against their enemies by furnishing them with arms and keeping their enemies from attacking them . . . they must never promise us anything which they did not mean to perform." After an awkward silence, the two lesser chiefs claimed that the decision was made by <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name>.

A clearly marked, well-traveled trail at the outset, it soon became a faint trace often lost in a tangle of fallen timber and dense thickets. Serious trouble struck on September 14 when <name type="person" key="Old Toby">Old Toby's</name> memory failed and he led the party off the main track, down a fishing path, and to the <name type="place" key="Lochsa (Upper Kooskooske) River">Lochsa River</name>. On short rations already, the expedition killed one of their horses and remembered how lost and hungry they were by naming a nearby stream <name type="place" key="Colt Killed Creek">Killed Colt Creek</name>. In order to rejoin the trail, the explorers had to make a painful climb up the side of <name type="place" key="Wendover Ridge (Snowy Mountain)">Wendover Ridge</name>. Horses slipped and fell, rolling down in tangles of brush and broken equipment. For hungry and bone-tired explorers, the <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo</name> was already coming to symbolize the kind of physical challenge they had not experienced since the days at the <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name> portage and on the <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead River</name>.</p>
               <p>
Monday, September 16, was perhaps the grimmest day in the expedition's memory. Sleeping on any level places they could find, the explorers awoke to find themselves covered with a heavy blanket of snow. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> caught the general mood that morning as he watched men without stockings fumble in the cold to wrap rags around already numb feet. Gasping for breath in the thin air, the expedition marched thirteen painful miles "with grat dificulty." <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, never one to complain in the face of adversity, admitted, "I have [never] been [as] wet and as cold in every part . . . in my life." With no end in sight, there would be another night sleeping in the snow and struggling to survive on meager rations.</p>

By the night of September 17, it was plain that drastic measures had to be taken. The expedition was nearing the limits of its physical endurance. Believing that <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_NezPerce.html"

In the evening after the conference, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and two men began to suffer from severe gastrointestinal distress.

Despite widespread illness, the expedition made their canoe-building camp on September 26 and began to work.
