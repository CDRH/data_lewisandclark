The following lists represent <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> botanical efforts during the first year of the expedition. The first document is <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> list of specimens from Codex R, pp. 4–49; it was probably prepared at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, perhaps from other notes now lost. The second document was prepared by <name type="person" key="Vaughan, John">John Vaughan</name> of the American Philosophical Society as a receiving list of the specimens and was probably copied from identification labels accompanying the items or from a separate list. It is from the Donation Book at the American Philosophical Society (see <ref n="lc.jrn.v02.appendix.b" type="related">Appendixes B</ref> and <ref n="lc.jrn.v02.appendix.c" type="related">C</ref>). The "H" following some items in the Donation Book may represent an accession check and may stand for "have." The specimens are apparently the items in box 4 of the goods sent back from <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> in April 1805, and designated "Specimens of plants numbered from 1 to 60." See Jackson (LLC), 1:235, 239–40 n. 21; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> entry, <ref n="lc.jrn.1805-04-03" type="related">April 3, 1805</ref>, and accompanying notes. The discrepancy in the number of items cannot be explained. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> has additional specimens numbered 100–108. <name type="person" key="Vaughan, John">Vaughan's</name> numbers 61 and 62 may be his own convention for loose, unnumbered items, while his note on the "corolla of tobacco" may apply to items 106 or 108. These herberia (with some losses) are at the <name type="place" key="Academy of Natural Sciences">Academy of Natural Sciences</name>, <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>.</p>
            <p>
The discussion of this collection, here called the <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name> collection, is necessarily brief in order not to duplicate a specialized volume which will appear as the final book in this edition. The natural history volume will be much like the <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi> with its introduction, calendar, and illustrations. The final volume will include a discussion of the party's botanical activities, an introduction to the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> herbarium at the Academy, and illustrations of those specimens. An excellent examination of this topic is available in Cutright (LCPN), 357–75.</p>
            <p>
We provide at this time a table of botanical identifications. A similar table, probably in the form of a calendar, will accompany the natural history volume and will include the whole of the <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> herbarium. The present table gives the voucher number, approximate date and place of collection, and the current scientific and common name. Since <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> voucher numbers are not chronologically or systematically arranged from <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> to <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, we have recorded the items in chronological fashion to provide easy comparison with the daily journals and their corresponding botanical annotation. The lack of chronology in the voucher numbers may be evidence that label numbers were not assigned at the time of collection, but later, possibly at <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. The "1804 Dates" are those on labels at the Academy or from the lists of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Vaughan, John">Vaughan</name>. The location was determined by comparing the specimen dates with journal entries, <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi> maps, and our annotation. In most instances <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> precise location for collecting the specimens is unclear, so we have given the closest geographic landmark for that day.</p>
            <p>
The most difficult task was to apply current scientific and common names to the herbaria. Since the first thirty items are missing from the <name type="place" key="Academy of Natural Sciences">Academy</name>, we had to rely on <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> descriptions for identifications. The lack of existing specimens cannot be explained and accounts for several unidentified items. The remaining specimens at the &gt;Academy were examined by Dr. A. T. Harrison, formerly of the University of Nebraska, with the assistance of the Academy's curatorial staff. He also examined previous botanical work on the plants, current botanical literature, and employed his own familiarity with regional flora. Items number 37,62, and 102 remain unidentified as they were not to be found in the collection. Numbers 62 and 102 may never have been accessioned, while number 37 remains a curious loss similar to the first thirty specimens.

A List of specimines of plants collected by me on the <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> and <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> rivers—    contain such observations on the vegitable kingdom spread to our view in this rich country as they have occurred to my mind.—or as the several subjects have presented themselves to my view.—</p>
               <p>
No. <hi rend="italic">1</hi>.    a species of Cress, taken at <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name> May 10th 1804.    it is common in the open growns on the <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> bottoms, appears in the uncultivated parts of the lots gardens and orchards, the seed come to maturity by the 10th of May in most instances.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 2</hi>.    was taken on the 22ed of May 1804 on the bank of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> about 8 miles above <name type="place" key="Saint Charles, Mo.">St. Charles</name>    it is common in the botom lands—    rises to the hight of two feet, and rarely puts forth more than two stalks from the same root and most commonly only one—    it's root is spiral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 3</hi>.    Was taken on the 23rd of May 1804, near the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Femme Osage (Osage Woman's) River">Osage Woman's creek</name>, it is a srub and resembles much in growth the <hi rend="italic">bladder scenna</hi>, it rises to hight of eight or ten feet and is an inhabitant of a moist rich soil.—    usually the verge of the river bank.—    it is a handsome Shrub</p>
               <p>
No. 4.    Was taken at a small Village North side of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> called <name type="place" key="La Charette, Mo.">Sharett</name>, on the 25th of May 1804.    this is the last settlement on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; and consists of ten or twelve families mostly hunters.    this specimine is the seed of the Cottonwood which is so abundant in this country, it has now arrived at maturity and the wind when blowing strong drives it through the air to a great distance being supported by a parrishoot of this cottonlike substance which gives the name to the tree    in some seasons it is so abundant as to be troublesome to the traveler—    this tree arrives at great sise, grows extreemly quick    the wood is of a white colour, soft spungey and light, perogues are most usually made of these trees, the wood is not durable nor do I know any othe valuable purpose which it can answer except that just mentioned—</p>
               <p>
this tree forms a great majority of the timber bordering the rivers <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> and <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>; it extends itself throughout the extensive bottom lands of these streams and seases to appear when the land rises into hills—    when these rivers form new lands on their borders or Islands in their steams, which they are pertually doing, the sweet willow is the first tree or shrub which usually makes it's appearance, this continues one two or three years and is then supplanted by the Cotton wood which invariably succeedes it.—    this tree resembles much in it's air and appearance that beatifull and celibrated tree the Lombardy poplar; and more particularly so when in its young state; the young plants grow very close untill they have attained the age of four or five years, a proportion of them then begin to dye and the forrest opens and gives place to sundry other shrubs and plants which will be noticed in their proper places.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 5</hi>.    was taken on the 27th of May 1804 near the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Gasconade River">Gasconade</name>; it is a species of cress which grows very abundantly alonge the river beach in many places; my men make use of it and find it a very pleasant wholsome sallad.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No.6</hi>.    Was taken on the 27th of may 1804 near the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Gasconade River">Gasconade</name>; it is a species of rape or kail, it grows on the beach of the river, when young my men used it a boiled green and found healthy and pleasent.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 7</hi>.    was found on the 27th of May 1804 near the water side about 10 miles below the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Gasconade River">Gasconade</name>, it rises to the hight of three feet and puts forth many large suculent branched stalks from the same root, this plant is a stranger to me.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 8</hi>.    Was taken the 29th of May 1804 below the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Osage (Osarge) River">Osage Rivr.</name>    this plant is known in <name type="place" key="Kentucky">Kentuckey</name> and many other parts of this western country by the name of the yellow root—    it is a sovereighn remidy for a disorder common in this quarter called the Soar eyes—    this complaint is common    it is a violent inflamation of the eyes attended with high fevers and headach, and is extreemly distressing, and frequently attended with the loss of sight—    this root affords a speady and efficasious remidy for this disorder prepared &amp; used in the following manner—    let the roots be geathered washed and carefully dryed in the shade; brake them in pieces of half an inch in length and put them in a bottle or viol, taking care to fill the vessel about two thirds full of the dryed root, then fill the vessell with could water, rain water is preferable; let it remain about six hours shaking it occasionally and it will be fit for use; the water must remain with the root and be applyed to the eyes frequently by wetting a piece of fine linin touching them gently with it.—    this root is a fine aromatic bitter, and a strong asstringent; it is probable that it might be applyed in many cases as a medicene with good effect, but I have not learnt that any experiment has been made by an inward application—    it makes an excellent mouth water, and a good outward applycation for wounds or inflamations of every kind.—    native of rich bottom lands on the rivers—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 9</hi>.    Was taken on the 30th of May 1804 below the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Osage (Osarge) River">Osage river</name>; it rises from 18 Inches to 2 feet in hight; is a beautifull green plant found most generally on the sides of rich hills in the forrest    it's radix is fiberous—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 10</hi>.    This plant was taken the 1st of June at the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Osage (Osarge) River">Osage river</name>; it is known in this country by the name of the <hi rend="italic">wild ginger</hi>, it resembles that plant somewhat in both taste and effect; it is a strong stomatic stimelent, and frequently used in sperits with bitter herbs—    it is common throughout the rich lands in the Western country.</p>
               <p>
No. 11.    Was taken the 3rd of June above the mouth of the <name type="place" key="Osage (Osarge) River">Osage river</name>; it is the groath of high dry open praries; rises to the hight of 18 inches or two feet puts forth many stems from the same root; the radix is fiborous; the Indians frequently use the fruit of this plant to alay their thirst as they pass through these extensive dry praries common to many parts of the country bordering on the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; it resembles much the Indigo in the appearance of it's growth.    it bears it's fruit much like the indigo, a stem projects about three inches from the main stem at an angle of about 20 degrees, and bears from [two?] to four podds, which in their succulent and unripe state as at this season of the year are about the sise of a pullet's egg, somewhat flattened on two sides; the matrix is formed in two lobes and the seed are like pees and attached to the matrix in the same manner, single and adhering to the center    the pulp is crisp &amp; clear and tasts very much like the hull of a gardin pee.—    when ripe the fruit is of a fine red coulour and sweet flavor.—    it dose not ripen untill the middle of June.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 12</hi>.    1st of August 1804.    one of our hunters brought us a bough of the purple courant, which is frequently cultivated in the <name type="place" key="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</name> states; the fruit was ripe; I presume it is a native of North America—    here it grows generally in the praries but is not very abundant.—    No. 12 is a specimine of it's leaves.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 13</hi>.    The <hi rend="italic">narrow leaf willow</hi> taken on the 14th of June—    this tree is male and female, the female bearing it seed in a small pod small ova form of three lobes, or devisions—    these pods are attached to a stem which projects from the small boughs, and are from thirty to fifty in number, about this season they begin to ripen, when the pods burst and a great number of small seeds each furnished with a parrishoot of a cotton-like substance are discharged from those cels.    they readily float in the air and are driven by the wind to a great distance, they are so abundant at some times as to be disagreeable to the traveller—    the <hi rend="italic">male</hi> plant has sucession of it's flowers, commencing to bloom about the 1st of June and continuing untill the 1st of August, they are a small tausel of a half, or ¾ of an inch in length, round, and tapering to the extremity, putting frort from it's sides an infinite number of small stamens of a brown colour.    it's leaves are numerous narrow, slightly indented, of a yellowish 〈deep〉 green, on the uper side, and whiteish green underneath, pointed, being widest in the middle which rarely exceeds ⅛th of an inch, it is smoth, tho' not glossey</p>
               <p>
This tree is invariably the first which makes it's appearance on the newly made Lands on the borders of the <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name> and <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, and seems to contribute much towards facilitating the operation of raisin this ground still higher; they grow remarkably close and in some instances so much so that they form a thicket almost impenetrable    the points of land which are forming allways become eddies when overflown in high water    these willows obstruct the force of the water and makes it more still which causes the mud and sand to be deposited in greater quantities; the willow is not attal imbarrassed or injured by this inundation, but 〈the moment the water subsides〉 puts forth an innumerable quantity of small fibrous roots from every part of its trunk near the surface of the water which further serve to collect the mud, if there happens not to be a sufficient quantity of mud depossited in the one season to cover the trunk of the willow as high as these capillery roots when the water subsides they fall down and rest on the trunk of the tree and conceal it for 18 or 20 Inches; these capillery roots now perish and the willow puts forth other roots at the surface of the ground which enter it and furnish the tree with it's wanted nutriment—    this willow never rises to any considerable sise, it is seldom seen larger than a mans arm, and scarcely every rises higher than 25 feet.    the wood is white light and tough, and is generally used by the watermen for <hi rend="italic">setting poles</hi> in preference to anything else.—    as the willow incrases in size and the land gets higher 〈and more dry〉 by the annul inundations of the river, the weeker plants decline dye and give place to the cotton-wood which is it's ordinary successor, and these last in their turn also thin themselves as they become larger in a similar manner and leave the ground open for the admission of other forest trees and under brush—    these willow bars form a pleasant beacon to the navigator at that season when the banks of the river are tumbling in, as they seldom high and rearly falling in but on the contrary most usually increasing.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 14</hi>.    The <hi rend="italic">wide leaf willow</hi> or that species which I believe to be common to most parts of the <name type="place" key="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</name> States.    it grows in similar situations to that discribed with rispect to the narrow leaf willow, but is never found in such abundance, it arrives to greater size some times to forty feet in hight and eighteen inches in diameter, the leave is smoth ovate, pointed, finely indented, a pale green on the upper side and of a whiteis green or silver colour underneath—    like the narrow leaf willow the leaf is widest in the middle where it is from one inch to ¾ wide.—    it bears it's seed in the manner discribed of the other and the plants ar likewise male and female.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 15</hi>.    Was taken on the 20th of July, a pieniel plant, an inhabitant of the open praries or plains, high situations, where the grass is low.    the flower is a pale purple colour small form a kind of button of a long conic like form which terminate it's branches which are numerous—    it grows abot 2½ or three feet high—    it is a stranger to me.—    the leaves are small and narrow, and divided into three on a stem</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">No. 16</hi>.    this is much the same as No. 15 with this difference that the blume of the conic tausel are white in stead of purple and it's leaves single fewer and longer—</p>

No. 18.    was taken 30th July grows in the praries in high situations, it's radix 〈matrix〉 is peennial, it grows about three ½ or 4 feet high    it has a long tap root it is but little branced, it's colateral brances are short and furnished with many leaf stems which are garnished by a great number of small leaves which are attatch by pairs on either side and resemble some of the sensative bryers, tho I could not discover that this plant par took of that quality.—    it's flower is of a gloubelar form composed of a number of fibers of a yellowish white, and produces as a fruit a bunch of little pees which are all bent edgeways into the form of a semicircle and so closely connected and compressed as to form a globular figure of a curious appearance—</p>

The <hi rend="italic">Larger species</hi> (see specimine plants No. 108) rises to the hight of three feet.    it's round green and succulent much branched when suffered to grow singly.    in that sittuation it branches near the ground and continues to branch and rebranch as it rises at the distance of an inch or 2 inches, thus forming an infinite number of boughs at the top which are terminated by the flowers which are tubelar; trunnicated scalluped on the edges and five pointed, white colour, order, <hi rend="italic">pentandria moniginia</hi>,— the leaf is of a toung-like form. 〈The indians〉 the larger of which are attached
to the lower part of the stalk.    one inch wide in the broadest part, &amp; 2½ inches long.—    the demins as they are higher on the stalk, tho' they increas in number—    The indians cultivate it in the following manner—they prepare hills at the distance of about 2½ feet from each other, and leavel the top nearly leaving it somewhat convex.    in these hills they sew the seed as early in the spring as the climate will permit them to prepare the earth say latter end of April; they keep the hill clear of weeds and grass by plucking it from among the stalks of tobacco with their fingers—and sometimes allso thin the stalks of tobacco by plucking up the weaker stalks tho they leave many stalks to grow on each hill.    when the tobacco begins to form it's seed poods it is then ready for the knife when a great portion from each hill is cut and hung on sticks untill it is nearly dry—when they form them into carrots of the thickness of a mans arm role them closely with willow bark and hang them in the smoke of their lodges to dry.    in forming the carrot, they put the butts or lower parts of the stalks together.    where the tobacco is cultivated with a view to make carrots the stalks are so thick that they do not attain a thickness at the largest part of the stem greater than that of a small quill—    They esteem much more the carraller [corolla] dryed for the purpose of smoking—and for this purpose leave some plant more widely seperated from each other—in which situation they produce a greater abundance of flowers &amp; seed.    they begin to blume in the month of [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] and continue untill the first frost;—during the full blume of the flower they pluck the carrallar together with the flower and discarding the latter suffer the former to dry in the shade when perfectly dryed it resembles at first view the green <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> and in that state it is smoked by the indians and I found it very pleasent—    it dose not affect the nerves in the same manner that the tobacco cultivated in the U' S. dose—    The smaller species of this plant differs but little from this just discribed—    it is cultivated in the same manner and bears a flower like the other only smaller—    the only difference is the form of the leaf, which is larger (say) 4 times the size and <hi rend="italic">ovate</hi>—    they dry this on sticks and use it in that manner    it is reather stronger than the large kind and is seldom made into carrots by the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Recares</name>.—</p>

The preparation &amp; application of the root is as follows—    having procured a quantity of the roots, wash them clean &amp; Suffer them to dry in the Shade, break them with the fingers as fine as you conveniently can, put them in a glass vessel, taking care to fill it about ⅔ with the Broken root, then add rain or river water until the Vessel is filled, shake it frequently &amp; it will be fit for use in the course of 6 hours. The Water must not be decanted but remaining with the root is to be frequently applied by wetting a piece of the fine linnen and touching thee Eyes gently with it—    This root has a fine aromatic bitter taste, it is probable that it might be appplied internally in many cases with good effect, but I have not learnt that any experiments have yet been made with it in that way.

Voucher 105 is the seed of the larger tobacco variety and 107 is the seed of the smaller variety. The large variety, based on <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name> excellent description, is clearly <hi rend="italic">Nicotiana quadrivalvis</hi> Pursh. The voucher specimen 45 is the plant with flowers. The small variety, described by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> as being similar but with smaller flowers, and with larger, ovate leaves, is very different and fits the description of <hi rend="italic">Nicotiana rustica</hi> L. var. <hi rend="italic">pumila</hi> Schrank. Goodspeed, 356; Cronquist et al., 72. This is important primary evidence that two different species of tobacco were cultivated by the Arikaras. Cf. Gilmore (UPI), 61–62; Gilmore (SCAT), 480–81. Unfortunately, Lewis did not collect a specimen of this smaller species. The tobacco seeds were returned to <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> and apparently cultivated in the gardens of William Hamilton and Bernard McMahon.
