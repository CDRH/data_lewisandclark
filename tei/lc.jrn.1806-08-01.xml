The rain still continuing I set out early as usual and proceeded on at a good rate.    at 9 A. M. we saw a large brown bear swiming from an island to the main shore we pursued him and as he landed <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> and myself shot and killed him; we took him on board the perogue and continued our rout.    at 11 A. M. we passed the entrance of <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Mussel shell river</name>.<ref target="n37080101" n="1"/>    at 1 in the evening we arrived at a bottom on S. W. side where there were several spacious Indian lodges built of sticks and an excellent landing. as the rain still continued with but little intermission and appearances seemed unfavorable to it's becomeing fair shortly, I determined to halt at this place at least for this evening and indeavour to dry my skins of the bighorn which had every appearance of spoiling, an event which I would not should happen on any consideration as we have now passed the country in which they are found and I therefore could not supply the deficiency were I to loose these I have. I halted at this place being about 15 ms. below <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Missel shell river</name>,<ref target="n37080102" n="2"/> had fires built in the lodges and my skins exposed to dry.    shortly after we landed the rain ceased tho' it still continued cloudy all this evening.    a white bear came withint 50 paces of our camp before we perceived it; it stood erect on it's hinder feet and looked at us with much apparent unconsern, we seized our guns which are always by us and several of us fired at it and killed it.    it was a female in fine order, we fleesed it and extracted several gallons of oil.    this speceis of bar are rearly as poor at this season of the year as the common black bear nor are they ever as fat as the black bear is found in winter; as they feed principally on flesh, like the wolf, they are most fatt when they can procure a sufficiency of food without rispect to the season of the year. the oil of this bear is much harder than that of the black bear being nearly as much so as the lard of a hog.    the flesh is by no means as agreeable as that of the black bear, or Yahkah or partycoloured bear<ref target="n37080103" n="3"/> of the West side of the <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>.    on our way today we killed a buck Elk in fine order the skins and a part of the flesh of which we preserved.    after encamping this evening the hunters killed 4 deer and a beaver. The Elk are now in fine order particularly the males.    their horns have obtained their full growth but have not yet shed the velvet or skin which covers them.    the does are found in large herds with their young and a few young bucks with them.    the old bucks yet herd together in parties of two to 7 or 8.—

We Set out early as usial the wind was high and ahead which caused the water to be a little rough and delayed us very much    aded to this we had Showers of rain repeetedly all day at the intermition of only a fiew minits between them. My Situation a very disagreeable one.    in an open Canoe wet and without a possibility of keeping my Self dry.    the Country through which we passed is in every respect like that through which I passed yesterday. The brooks have all Some water in them from the rains which has fallen.    this water is excessively muddy. Several of those brooks have Some trees on their borders as far as I can See up them. I observe Some low pine an cedar<ref target="n37080104" n="4"/> on the Sides of the rugid hills on the Stard. Side, and Some ash timber<ref target="n37080105" n="5"/> in the high bottoms.    the river has more Sand bars today than usial, and more Soft mud.    the current less rapid.    at 2 P. M. I was obliged to land to let the Buffalow Cross over.    not withstanding an island of half a mile in width over which this gangue of Buffalow had to pass and the Chanel of the river on each Side nearly ¼ of a mile in width, this gangue of Buffalow was entirely across and as thick as they could Swim.    the Chanel on the Side of the island the went into the river was crouded with those animals for ½ an hour.    [<hi rend="italic">NB: I was obliged to lay to for an hour</hi>] the other Side of the island for more than 3/4 of an hour. I took 4 of the men and killed 4 fat Cows for their fat and what portion of their flesh the Small Canoes Could Carry    that which we had killed a few days ago being nearly Spoiled from the wet weather.    encamped on an Island Close to the Lard Shore.<ref target="n37080106" n="6"/>    two gangues of Buffalow Crossed a little below us, as noumerous as the first.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 1st of Aug.</hi> 1806.    We embarked early in a wet disagreeable morning, and in a short time saw a large brown or grizly bear swimming in the river, which we killed, and took on board; passed the mouth of <name type="place" key="Musselshell (Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, Shell) River">Muscle shoal river</name>;<ref target="n37080117" n="17"/> and at noon halted to dine at some old Indian lodges. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> being afraid, from the dampness of the weather, that the skins he had procured of these big-horned animals would spoil, thought it adviseable to stay here this afternoon, and dry them by a fire in these old lodges; and some of the men went out to hunt. About an hour after we landed here, a large bear came so close to our camp, that one of the men<ref target="n37080118" n="18"/> shot and killed it from our fire. In the evening our hunters came in and had killed several deer. The afternoon was cloudy with some rain; and having made a fire and put the skins to dry with two men to attend them, made our arrangements 
for the night.
