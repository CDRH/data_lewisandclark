          land through a country almost inaccessible from the fallen timber, brush and sink-holes,
          which were now disgused by the snow; we therefore concluded to relinquish those two Elk
          for the present, and ordered every man who could be speared from the fort to go early in

          did 
          <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>last winter by the uce of murcury.
          <ref target="n28012701" n="1"/>I cannot learn that the Indians have any simples which
          are sovereign specifics in the cure of this disease; and indeed I doubt very much wheter
          any of them have any means of effecting a perfect cure.    when once this
          disorder is contracted by them it continues with them during life; but always ends in
          decipitude, death, or premature old age; tho' from the uce of certain simples together
          with their diet, they support this disorder with but little inconvenience for many
          years, and even enjoy a tolerable share of health; particularly so among the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Chippewa Indians">Chippeways</name>who I believe to be

          the smallest species of the sumac, readily distinguished by it's winged rib, or common
          footstalk, which supports it's oppositely pinnate leaves.    these decoctions
          are drank freely and without limitation.    the same decoctions are used in
          cases of the gonnaerea and are effecatious and sovereign.    notwithstanding

          individuals, at least the males who are always sufficiently exposed to the observations
          or inspection of the phisician.    in my whole rout down this river I did not
          see more than two or three with the gonnaerea and about double that number with the

          shape of that common to the atlantic states which produces the berry commonly called 
          <hi rend="italic">Solloman's seal berry.</hi>   this berry also is attatched
          to the top of the stem in the same manner; and is of a globelar form, consisting of a
          thin soft pellecle which encloses a soft pulp inveloping from three to four seeds,
          white, firm, smothe, and in the form of a third or quarter of a globe, and large in
          proportion to the fruit or about the size of the seed of the common small grape.
             this berry when grown and unripe is not speckles as that of the Solomon's
          seal berry is; this last has only one globular smoth white firm seed in each berry.— the
          Solme grows in the woodlands among the moss and is an annual plant to all

               <p>Monday Janry 27th    It froze hard during last night, &amp; this morning
          was clear &amp; cold.    One of our hunters
          <ref target="n28012711" n="11"/>was sent out, to hunt in order to supply the Men with
          Meat at the Camp where they are making Salt &amp; 2 of our party 〈was sent〉 who went out
          in Order to go to that place on the 23d instant, had not as yet returned.—   
          About noon one of our hunters
          <ref target="n28012712" n="12"/>that had been out hunting returned to the fort.
             he informed us that he had killed 5 Elk &amp; that another of the hunters
          had killed 3 Elk, &amp; that another of the party had also killed two Elk but that these
          last were killed at a long distance from the Fort.</p>
