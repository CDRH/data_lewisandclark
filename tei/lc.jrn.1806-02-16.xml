               <p>By several trials made today in order to adjust my Octant and ascertain her error in
          the direct observation, I found that it was 2° 1' 45" + or additive beyond the fracture;
          this error was ascertained by a comparison with my sextant the error of which had been
          previously ascertained.    the error of Octant in the direct observation on
          the broken limb next to 0 or below 55° 20' inclusive is 2° additive only.— Sent

               <p>The Indian dog is usually small or much more so than the common cur.   
          they are party coloured; black white brown and brindle are the most usual colours.
             the head is long and nose pointed eyes small, ears erect and pointed like
          those of the wolf, hair short and smooth except on the tail where it is as long as that
          of the curdog and streight.    the natives do not eat them nor appear to make
          any other use of them but in hunting the Elk as has been before observed.— The brown
          white or grizly bear are found in the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>in the timbered parts of
          it or Westerly side but rarely; they are more common below the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky Mountain</name>on the borders of the
          plains where there are copses of brush and underwood near the watercouses.   
          they are by no means as plenty on this side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>as on the other, nor do I
          beleive that they are found atall in the woody country, which borders this coast as far
          in the interior as the range of mountains which, pass the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia 〈river〉</name>between the

          <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>of the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>which they had wounded and taken
          alive. I believe this to be the largest Bird of North America.    it was not
          in good order and yet it wayed 25 lbs    had it have been so it might very
          well have weighed 10 lbs. more or 35 lbs. between the extremities of the wings it
          measured 9 feet 2 Inches; from the extremity of the beak to that of the toe 3 feet 9
          inches and a half.    from hip to toe 2 feet, girth of the head 9 inches ¾.
          Girth of the neck 7½ inches; Girth of the body exclusive of the wings 2 feet 3 inches;
          girth of the leg 3 inches.    the diameter of the eye 4½/10ths of an inch, the
          iris of a pale scarlet red, the puple of a deep Sea green or black and occupies about
          one third of the diameter of the eye the head and part of the neck as low as the figures
          1 2 is uncovered with feathers except that portion of it represented by dots foward and
          under the eye. (See likeness on the other Side of this leaf)
          <ref target="n28021605" n="5"/>the tail is Composed of twelve feathers of equal length,
          each 14 inches. the legs are 4¾ inches in length and of a whiteish colour uncovered with
          feathers, they are not entirely Smooth but not imbricated; the toes are four in number
          three of which are foward and that in the center much the longest; the fourth is Short
          and is inserted near the inner of the three other toes and reather projecting foward.
             the thye is covered with feathers as low as the Knee.    the top
          or upper part of the toes are imbricated with broad scales lying transversly; the nails
          are black and in proportion to the Size of the bird comparitively with those of the Hawk
          or Eagle, Short and bluntly pointed—.    the under Side of the wing is Covered
          with white down and feathers.    a white Stripe of about 2 inches in width,
          also marks the outer part of the wing, imbraceing the lower points of the feathers,
          which [c]over the joints of the wing through their whole length or width of that part of
          the wing.    all the other feathers of whatever part are of a Glossy Shineing
          black except the down, which is not glossy, but equally black.    the Skin of
          the beak and head to the joining of the neck is of a pale orrange Yellow, the other part
          uncovered with feathers is of a light flesh Colour.    the Skin is thin and
          wrinkled except on the beak where it is Smooth. This bird fly's very clumsily.
             nor do I know whether it ever Seizes it's prey alive, but am induced to
          believe it does not.    we have Seen it feeding on the remains of the whale
          and other fish which have been thrown up by the waves on the Sea Coast.   
          these I believe constitute their principal food, but I have no doubt but that they also
          feed on flesh.    we did not meet with this bird un[t]ille we had decended the
          
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>below the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">great falls</name>; and have
          found them more abundant below tide water than above.    this is the Same
          Species of Bird which 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Field</name>killed on the 18th of Novr. last
          and which is noticed on that day tho' not fully discribed then I thought this of the
          Buzzard Specis. I now believe that this bird is reather of the Vulture genus than any
          other, tho' it wants Some of their characteristics particularly the hair on the neck,
          and the feathers on the legs.    this is a handsom bird at a little distance.
             it's neck is proportionably longer than those of the Hawks or Eagle. 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>also brought a Grey Eagle which
          appeared to be of the Same kind common to the U, States.    it weighed 15 pds.
          and measured 7 feet 7 inches between the extremities of the wings—.</p>
