               <p>This morning set out at an early hour, and come too at ½ after 7 A. M. on the Lard.
          Shore 1¼ miles above the mouth of a small creek which we named 
          <name type="place" key="American (Corvus) Creek">
                     <hi rend="italic">Corvus</hi>
                  </name>, in consequence of having kiled a beatiful bird of that genus near it
          <ref target="n06091602" n="2"/>   we concluded to ly by at this place the
          ballance of this day and the next, in order to dry our baggage which was wet by the
          heavy showers of rain which had fallen within the last three days, and also to lighten
          the boat by transfering a part of her lading to the red perogue, which we now determined
          to take on with us to our winter residence wherever that might be;
          <ref target="n06091603" n="3"/>while some of the men were imployed in this necessary
          labour others were dressing of skins washing and mending their cloaths &amp;c.
             
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>and myself kiled each a buck
          immediately on landing near our encampment; the deer were very gentle and in great
          numbers on this bottom which had more timber on it than any part of the river we had
          seen for many days past, consisting of Cottonwood Elm, some indifferent ash and a
          considerable quanty of a small species of white oak
          <ref target="n06091604" n="4"/>which is loaded with acorns of an excellent flavor
             very little of the bitter roughness of the nuts of most species of oak, the
          leaf of this oak is small pale green and deeply indented, [

          higher than thirty feet is much branched, the bark is rough and thick and of a light
          colour; the cup which contains the acorn is fringed on it's edges and imbraces the nut
          about one half; the acorns were now falling, and we concluded that the number of deer
          which we saw here had been induced thither by the acorns of which they are remarkably
          fond.    almost every species of wild game is fond of the acorn, the Buffaloe
          Elk, deer, bear, turkies, ducks, pigegians and even the wolves feed on them; we sent
          three hunters
          <ref target="n06091605" n="5"/>out who soon added eight deer and two Buffaloe to our
          strock of provisions; the Buffaloe were so pour that we took only the tongues skins and
          marrow bones; the skins were particularly acceptable as we were in want of a covering
          for the large perogue to secure the baggage; the clouds during this day and night
          prevented my making any observations.

          steep declivities of hills, or their moist situations, were sheltered from the effects
          of the fire.    these extensive planes had been lately birnt and the grass had
          sprung up and was about three inches high.    vast herds of Buffaloe deer Elk
          and Antilopes were seen feeding in every direction as far as the eye of the observer
