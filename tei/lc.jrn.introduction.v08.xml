            <p>On June 10, 1806, the Corps of Discovery left 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>on the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater
        River</name>and moved up to higher ground on 
        <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">Weippe
        Prairie</name>. They had waited over a month for the snow to melt in the 
        <name type="place" key="Bitterroot (Snow) Mountains">Bitterroot Mountains</name>so that
        they could proceed eastward on the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>. They set out on the trail on June
        15, but soon realized that they could not find their way in the deep snow. On June 17,
        after caching many of their goods in trees, they turned back. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>lamented, "this is the first time
        since we have been on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or make a
        retrograde march." To add discomfort to discouragement he also reported, "it rained on us
        most of this evening."</p>
            <p>They returned to 
        <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">Weippe
        Prairie</name>and sent to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>camps to hire guides.
        Three young men offered to serve for the price of two guns. On June 24 the party set out
        again. The Indians found the trail easily and the party made their way to their old camp
        at 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name>, near
        present 
        <name type="place" key="Missoula, Mont.">Missoula</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>, taking only six days in contrast to the
        eleven days of the westbound trip. They spent a few days resting for the next stage of the
        journey. At 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>the captains had decided
        to divide the party for an extended time to investigate previously unexplored territory. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>would head east across the
        mountains to the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the
        Missouri</name>, then explore the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name>before returning to the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. His purpose was to discover if
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>drained northern reaches thus giving
        further territorial claims to the United States under the Louisiana Purchase. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>would go southeast to the site of 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Fortunate (Mont.)">Camp Fortunate</name>, then down the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson</name>rivers to
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks of the
        Missouri</name>. Part of his party would then take canoes down the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>to the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>to meet 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>party there, while 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>went east to the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>and down that river. His
        object was to inspect the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>and perhaps make contact with
        additional Indian tribes. The two captains and their men would meet at the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>.</p>
            <p>On July 3 the two groups went their separate ways, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>admitting "I could not avoid
        feeling much concern on this occasion although I hoped this separation was only
        momentary." It was the first time during the expedition that they had separated for so
        great a distance and time. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>headed down the 
        <name type="place" key="Bitterroot (Clark's, Flathead) River">Bitterroot River</name>,
        then up the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River">Clark
        Fork</name>and across the 
        <name type="place" key="Continental Divide">Continental Divide</name>along a route
        suggested by the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>and other Indians. By
        July 13 he and his nine men were at the 
        <name type="place" key="Upper portage camp (Mont.)">Upper Portage Camp</name>above the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>, delighted
        after months of poor rations to be back in buffalo country. When 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>men dug up the cache at the camp
        they encountered problems with the host of grizzly bears in the vicinity. 
        <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">Hugh McNeal</name>had a very close call with one
        beast in which he broke his musket over its head.</p>
            <p>Several of their horses disappeared, probably stolen by Indians, so 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>decided to take only his three
        best men—
        <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Reubin and Joseph Field</name>—on his
        exploration of the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergeant Patrick Gass</name>and the others
        remained at the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>to await the
        canoe party from the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and his companions set out on
        horseback on July 14, heading north to the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>and then upriver to the stream's upper
        forks. On 
        <name type="place" key="Cut Bank Creek (North Branch of Marias River)">Cut Bank
        Creek</name>, near the mountains, they camped from July 20 to 26, waiting for the clouds
        to clear so 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>could take astronomical
        observations; 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was disappointed to discover the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>did not extend so far north as he had
        hoped. On July 26 he gave up and set off for the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>, leaving what he named 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Disappointment (Mont.)">Camp Disappointment</name>.</p>
            <p>That afternoon they met eight Indians who proved to be 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians, Piegan">Piegan Blackfeet</name>, a
        tribe 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and his small party had wanted to
        avoid. They talked and all agreed to camp together that night on 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Two Medicine River (Main or South Branch Marias River)">Two
        Medicine River</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was awakened the next morning by
        sounds of a struggle as the Indians tried to make off with the expedition's guns and
        horses. 
        <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Field</name>stabbed one of the Indians to
        the heart, then the party pursued the others who were fleeing with the horses. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was forced to shoot one of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>in self-defense. It was
        the first and only instance of actual armed violence between the explorers and Indians in
        the whole expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, and the 
        <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fields</name>fled southeasterly as fast
        as they could. On July 28, near the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name>, they met the six men from the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>, along with
        
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant John Ordway</name>and nine others whom 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had sent down from the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name>. They moved
        quickly on to the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias</name>and retrieved cached goods and the
        white pirogue there. Then 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and his united group were able to
        travel down the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>with relative ease and speed.</p>
            <p>At the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>, which they reached on
        August 7, the remains of a note indicated that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had gone on down the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>followed, taking time to hunt for
        food. On August 11 he was hunting on the banks of the river with 
        <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</name>when the Frenchman,
        thinking the captain was an elk, accidentally shot him in the thigh. The journey continued
        with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>in considerable pain, and on
        August 12, below the 
        <name type="place" key="Little Knife River (Goat Pen Creek)">Little Knife River</name>in 
        <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>, the two captains and their
        parties were reunited.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party had had their difficulties,
        but their trip had been idyllic compared with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>. Like 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had left 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name>on
        July 3, moving southeast over some new terrain across the mountains to their old 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Fortunate (Mont.)">Camp Fortunate</name>at the forks of the 
        <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Beaverhead River</name>. There the
        party recovered cached goods and canoes and traveled down to the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks</name>by both
        canoe and horseback, arriving on July 13. From the forks 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>dispatched 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>with the canoes down the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>to the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>himself with twelve persons,
        including 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, and their child, headed for the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>, which they reached on July
        15.</p>
            <p>They continued down the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>on horseback, but on July 18 
        <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">George Gibson</name>was injured and could not
        ride after his horse threw him, so 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>decided to make canoes and continue
        by water. On the twenty-fourth he set out again, sending 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</name>with three
        men and the horses to travel overland to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages. 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>was to make contact with
        trader 
        <name type="person" key="Heney, Hugh">Hugh Heney</name>, going north into 
        <name type="place" key="Canada">Canada</name>if necessary, to secure 
        <name type="person" key="Heney, Hugh">Heney's</name>services as an intermediary with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor's</name>mission ended prematurely on
        the second night out when Indians, probably 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Crow Indians">Crows</name>, stole his party's horses. He
        and his men made 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>-style "bull boats" of
        buffalo hides and floated down the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>and the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>pursuing 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, whom they overtook on August 8.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>trip down the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>was uneventful. He passed the
        landmark he named "
        <name type="place" key="Pompeys Pillar (Pompy's Tower)">Pompy's Tower</name>"—after little
        
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</name>—on
        July 25, near present 
        <name type="place" key="Billings, Mont.">Billings</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>, and proceeded on, arriving at the mouth
        of the river on August 3. The original plan was for him to wait there for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, but the mosquitoes were terrible
        and game was scarce so he left a note for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and continued down the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. On August 11 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party met two trappers, 
        <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Joseph Dickson</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Hancock, Forrest">Forrest Hancock</name>, the first whites they
        had seen since April 1805. These men could provide little information from the East, since
        they had been absent since the summer of 1804. They did, however, inform 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>that the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>tribes were fighting one
        another again. The captain realized that his and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>successes at peacemaking had
        been limited and of short duration. The next day the wounded 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and his contingent caught up with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.</p>
            <p>The discomfort of his wound now caused 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>to give up his journalizing,
        leaving 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to continue the record to the end of
        the trip. Characteristically, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>last entry included the
        description of one last plant, the pin cherry. The Corps returned to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages on August 14. They
        remained there only three days, trying to persuade 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>chiefs to go with them to
        see the president, but only 
        <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>, the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>, and his family consented. 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, and 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Jean Baptiste</name>remained behind,
        and 
        <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name>received a discharge so he could
        return to the mountains on a trapping venture with 
        <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Dickson</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Hancock, George">Hancock</name>.</p>
            <p>As they headed downriver on August 17 their thoughts were all directed toward home.
        They stopped overnight on the twenty-first at the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>villages, where they found
        the Indians unhappy because a chief sent to 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>the previous year had not
        returned. No other chiefs would agree to go. On August 30 they gave some 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton Sioux</name>the cold shoulder
        because of the troubles they had had with this tribe in 1804. They met with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yankton</name>
               <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>near the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Niobrara (Quicurre, Rapid) River">Niobrara</name>on September 1,
        and held a friendly council. On September 4 they revisited 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd's</name>grave near the
        mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Big Sioux River (Rivière des Sioux)">Big Sioux River</name>.</p>
            <p>They were now meeting trading parties bound upriver, who gave them the news of over two
        years, including the fact that most people in the United States had given them up for
        lost, although "the President of the U. States had yet hopes of us." 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was recovering from his wound as
        they daily passed camp-sites and other familiar scenes of the toilsome upriver trip. In
        the last days of the journey the men were troubled by sore eyes, but they pushed on, eager
        to reach 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>. On September 20, near 
        <name type="place" key="La Charette, Mo.">La Charette</name>, they saw cows for the first
        time since leaving the settlements. Soon the inhabitants of the little settlement greeted
        them enthusiastically. The next day they reached 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Charles, Mo.">St. Charles</name>, meeting old friends, and
        on the twenty-second they saw a significant omen of change, the first American fort west
        of the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>at 
        <name type="place" key="Belle Fontaine, Mo.">Belle Fontaine</name>a few miles above the
        mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.</p>
            <p>Emerging from the river's mouth on September 23, they briefly visited the camp at 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">Wood River</name>that they had left some
        twenty-eight months before, then sailed on and reached 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>at noon. The citizens, having
        received advance word, lined the riverfront and cheered. Two days later, at 
        <name type="place" key="Christy's Tavern">Christy's Tavern</name>, they were treated to a
        lavish dinner, with eighteen toasts, ending with "Captains 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>—Their perilous services endear them
        to every American heart." The next day 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>brought his journals to an end with a
        brief, anticlimactic entry: "a fine morning    we commenced wrighting
