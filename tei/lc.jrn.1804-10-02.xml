He mentioned it as his opinion, that we should see no more Indians, until we should arrive at the nation of <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Rees</name>. We passed a range of black bluffs on the north side and a large bottom on the south, where there was some timber on the bank of the river. About 2 o'clock we discovered some Indians on the hills on the north side, and one of them came down to the bank and fired a gun; the object or intention we did not well understand, but were ready to meet an attack. We passed black bluffs on the south side, an island covered with timber, and a handsome bottom on the north side. We halted and spoke to the Indian, who said he belonged to the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Jonkta</name> or <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Brulé or Bois Brule">Babarole</name> band,<ref target="n07100208" n="8"/> and that there were 20 lodges of them. We told him we had seen two of their chiefs, and given them a flag and medal.<ref target="n07100209" n="9"/> 
We passed a creek on the south side, and encamped on a sand bar in the middle of the river.
