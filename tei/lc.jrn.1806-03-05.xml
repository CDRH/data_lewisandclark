               <p>This morning we were visited by two parties of 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clatsops</name>.    they
          brought some fish a hat and some skins for sale most of which we purchased. they
          returned to their village in the evening.    late in the evening the hunters
          returned from the 
          <name type="place" key="Youngs (Kilhow-a-nah-kle) River">
                     <hi rend="italic">kil-haw-â-nack-kle</hi>River</name>which discharges itself into the
          head of the bay. They had neither killed nor seen any Elk.    they informed us
          that the Elk had all gone off to the mountains a considerable distance from us.
             this is unwelcome information and reather allarming we have only 2 days
          provision on hand, and that nearly spoiled.    we made up a small assortment
          of articles to trade with the Indians and directed 
          <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergt. Pryor</name>to set out early in
          the morning in a canoe with 2 men, to ascend the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>to the resort of the Indian
          fishermen and purchase some fish; we also directed two parties of hunters to renew the
          Chase tomorrow early.    the one up the 
          <name type="place" key="Lewis and Clark (Fort, Netul) River">Netul</name>and the other
          towards 
          <name type="place" key="Point Adams">Point Adams</name>.    if we find that
          the Elk have left us, we have determined to ascend the river slowly and indeavour to
          procure subsistence on the way, consuming the Month of March in the woody country.
             earlyer than April we conceive it a folly to attempt the open plains where
          we know there is no fuel except a few small dry shrubs.    we shall not leave
          our quarters at 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">fort Clatsop</name>untill the first of
          April, as we intended unless the want of subsistance compels us to that measure. The
          common snipe of the marshes and the small sand snipe are the same of those common to the
          
          <name type="place" key="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</name>Coast tho' the former are by no
          means as abundant here.

          <ref target="n28030502" n="2"/>of the woody country is also similar to ours but not
          abundant.    those of the

          with those of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, tho' they are by no means so
          abundant. I have not seen the little singing lark
          <ref target="n28030503" n="3"/>or the large brown Curloo
          <ref target="n28030504" n="4"/>so common to the plains of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, but I beleive that the latter
          is an inhabitant of this country during summer from Indian information. I have no doubt
          but what many species of birds found here in Autumn and Summer had departed before our
          arrival.</p>
