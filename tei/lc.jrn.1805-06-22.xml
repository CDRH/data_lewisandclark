               <p>This morning early 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>and myself with all the party
          except 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>
                  <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name>,

          <name type="person" key="York">york</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">the Indian woman</name>, set out to pass the portage
          with the canoe and baggage to the 
          <name type="place" key="White Bear Islands">Whitebear Islands</name>, where we intend
          that this portage shall end. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clarke</name>piloted us through the
          plains.    about noon we reached a little stream about 8 miles on the portage
          where we halted and dined;
          <ref target="n16062201" n="1"/>we were obliged here to renew both axeltrees and the
          tongues and howns
          <ref target="n16062202" n="2"/>of one set of wheels which took us no more than 2 hours.
             these parts of our carriage had been made of cottonwood and one axetree of
          an old mast, all of which proved deficient and had broken down several times before we
          reached this place    we have now renewed them with the sweet willow and hope
          that they will answer better.    after dark we had reached within half a mile
          of our intended camp when the tongues gave way and we were obliged to leave the canoe,
          each man took as much of the baggage as he could carry on his back and proceeded to the
          river where we formed our encampment much fortiegued.    the prickly pears
          were extreemly troublesome to us sticking our feet through our mockersons. Saw a great
          number of buffaloe in the plains, also immence quantities of little birds and the large
          brown curloo;
          <ref target="n16062203" n="3"/>the latter is now seting; it lays it's eggs, which are
          of a p[a]le blue with black specks, on the ground without any preperation of a nest.
               there is a kind of larke here that much resembles the bird
          called the oldfield lark with a yellow brest and a black spot on the croop;
          <ref target="n16062204" n="4"/>tho' this differs from ours in the form of the tail
          which is pointed being formed of feathers of unequal length; the beak is somewhat longer
          and more curved and the note differs considerably; however in size, action, and colours
          there is no perceptable difference; or at least none that strikes my eye.   
          after reaching our camp
          <ref target="n16062205" n="5"/>we kindled our fires and examined the meat which 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>had left, but found only a
          small proportion of it, the wolves had taken the greater part.    we eat our
          suppers and soon retired to rest.</p>

          heavy with baggage. We went on slowly as our axletrees were weak; and about 12 o'clock
          one of them broke; when we had to halt and put in a new one. This accident happened at a
          draught
          <ref target="n16062207" n="7"/>where there was some willow, and we put in an axletree
          of that; which I believe is the best this country affords for the purpose. It was late
