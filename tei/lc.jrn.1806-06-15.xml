               <p>We had some little difficulty in collecting our horses this morning they had
          straggled off to a greater distance than usual.    it rained very hard in the
          morning and after collecting our horses we waited 〈an hour〉 for it to abait, but as it
          had every appearance of a settled rain we set out at 10 A. M.    we passed a
          little prarie at the distance of 8½ me.
          <ref target="n36061501" n="1"/>to which we had previously sent 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Feilds</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>.    we found two
          deer which they had killed and hung up.    at the distance of 2½ miles further
          we arrived at 
          <name type="place" key="Lolo (Collins's) Creek (Idaho)">Collins's Creek</name>where we
          found our hunters; they had killed another deer, and had seen two large bear together
          the one black and the other white.
          <ref target="n36061502" n="2"/>   we halted at the creek, dined and graized
          our horses.    the rains have rendered the road very slippery insomuch that it
          is with much difficulty our horses can get on    several of them fell but
          sustained no injury.    after dinner we proceeded up the creek about ½ a mile,
          passing it three times, thence through a high broken country to an Easterly fork of the
          same creek about 10½ miles and incamped near a small prarie in the bottom land.
          <ref target="n36061503" n="3"/>   the fallen timber in addition to the
          slippry roads made our march slow and extreemly laborious on our horses.   
          the country is exceedingly thickly timbered with long leafed pine, some pitch pine,
          larch, white pine, white cedar or arborvita of large size,
          <ref target="n36061504" n="4"/>and a variety of firs.    the undergrowth
          principally reed root
          <ref target="n36061505" n="5"/>from 6 to 10 feet high with all the other speceis
          enumerated the other day.    the soil is good; in some plaices it is of a red
          cast like our lands in
