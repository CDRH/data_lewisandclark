                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>returned this morning from
          the chase without having killed anything.    his hose left him last night, he
          pursued him but did not overtake him untill he had nearly reached our canip. The sick
          Cheif is fast on the recovery, he can bear his weight on his legs, and has acquired a
          considerable portion of strength.    the child is nearly well; 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>has so far recovered that we
          cannot well consider him an invalid any longer, he has had a tedious illness which he
          boar with much fortitude and firmness.—    The

          warriors; two of the latter were

          an indifferent one of ours and received a tomahawk to boot; this tomahawk was one for
          which 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>had given another in exchange
          with the

          <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)">rapids of
          the Columbia</name>.
          <ref target="n35060802" n="2"/>   we also exchanged two other of our
          indifferent horses with unsound backs for much better horses in fine order without any
          consideration but the horse itself.    several foot rarces were run this
          evening between the indians and our men. the indians are very active; one of them proved
          as fleet as 〈our best runner〉 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewer</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>, our swiftest runners.
             when the racing was over the men divided themselves into two parties and
          played prison base,
          <ref target="n35060803" n="3"/>by way of exercise which we wish the men to take
          previously to entering the mountain; in short those who are not hunters have had so
          little to do that they are geting reather lazy and slouthfull.—    after dark
          we had the violin played and danced for the amusement of ourselves and the indians.—
             one of the indians informed us that we could not pass the mountains untill
          the full of the next moon or about the first of July, that if we attempted it sooner our
          horses would be at least three days travel without food on the top of the mountain; this
          information is disagreable inasmuch as it causes some doubt as to the time at which it
          will be most proper for us to set out.    however as we have no time to loose
          we will wrisk the chances and set out as early as the indians generally think it
          practicable or the middle of this month.—</p>
