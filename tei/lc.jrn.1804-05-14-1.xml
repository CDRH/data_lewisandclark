               <p>On Monday the 14th of May 1804, we left our establishment at the mouth of the 
          <name type="place" key="Dubois River">river du Bois</name>or Wood river, a small river
          which falls into the 
          <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>, on the east-side, a mile
          below the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, and having crossed the 
          <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>proceeded up the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>on our intended voyage of
          discovery, under the command of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>was to join us in two or
          three days on our passage.
          <ref target="n030514-112" n="12"/>
               </p>
               <p>The corps consisted of forty-three men (including 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>, who were to command the
          expedition) part of the regular troops of the United States, and part engaged for this
          particular enterprize. The expedition was embarked on board a batteau and two periogues.
          The day was showery and in the evening we encamped on the north bank six miles up the
          river. Here we had leisure to reflect on our situation, and the nature of our
          engagements: and, as we had all entered this service as volunteers, to consider how far
          we stood pledged for the success of an expedition, which the government had projected;
          and which had been undertaken for the benefit and at the expence of the Union: of course
          of much interest and high expectation.</p>
               <p>The best authenticated accounts informed us, that we were to pass through a country
          possessed by numerous, powerful and warlike nations of savages, of gigantic stature,
          fierce, treacherous and cruel; and particularly hostile to white men. And fame had
          united with tradition in opposing mountains to our course, which human enterprize and
          exertion would attempt in vain to pass.
          <ref target="n030514-113" n="13"/>The determined and resolute character, however, of
          the corps, and the confidence which pervaded all ranks dispelled every emotion of fear,
          and anxiety for the present; while a sense of duty, and of the honour, which would
          attend the completion of the object of the expedition; a wish to gratify the
          expectations of the government, and of our fellow citizens, with the feelings which
          novelty and discovery invariably inspire, seemed to insure to us ample support in our
          future toils, suffering and dangers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Of the various publications which unite amusement and information, few can be justly
        held in higher estimation than the Journals and Narratives of Travellers and Voyagers: and
        in our own highly favoured country, the diffusion of general knowledge, the enterprizing
        spirit of the people, their commercial pursuits and habits of emigration, render such
        works particularly valuable and interesting; while the vigorous and unrestrained mind of
        the free American, by amplifying and embellishing the scenes presented to its view, enjoys
        the choicest luxuries of the entertainment they are calculated to afford. If it is
        conceded that discoveries made in North America are more important to the people of the
        United States than those made elsewhere, it will not be difficult to shew that none could
        have been made of so much importance to them in any part of the world as in the large
        tracts of country through which the late expedition, under the command of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>, passed. For if we take a
        view of the different discoveries and settlements previously made, we will find that those
        tracts through which the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>s, and their branches flow,
        commonly called 
        <hi rend="italic">unknown regions,</hi>were the only parts remaining unexplored, which
        could be considered valuable.</p>
               <p>The first discovery of the Western World by Europeans of which we have any authentick
        accounts, being near the southern extremity of North America, drew, as might be expected,
        their attention to that quarter: and the rage which this grand discovery excited for other
        enterprizes of the same nature; the avidity, with which avarice was stimulated to seize
        the precious metals, known to exist in those parts; the means held out for gratifying
        ambition; and the prospects of a lucrative commerce, with many other objects and
        considerations tended largely to extend them; while the diminution of the Northern
        Continent to a narrow isthmus, and its large gulfphs, bays and rivers, furnished and
        facilitated the means of exploring it. The spirit of enterprize, however, was not confined
        to the southern extremity; but extending itself to the climates congenial with those which
        it had left, and connecting with its researches the planting of colonies, important
        discoveries were made along the 
        <name type="place" key="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</name>coast. In the mean time the project
        of discovering a northwest passage to the 
        <name type="place" key="East Indies">East Indies</name>led the boldest naval commanders of
        Europe through the inland seas, bays and straights of the north; and at length produced
        surveys of the shores of 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">the Pacific</name>. To these discoveries, and those
        occasionally made during the settlement of the country within the limits of the United
        States, and in Canada, the 
        <name type="place" key="Hudson's Bay">Hudson's Bay</name>company, though not famed for
        enterprize added something to the stock of general information, and by their
        establishments aided others in their enterprizes. 
        <name type="person" key="Hearne, Samuel">Mr. Hearne</name>under the direction of this
        company, in an expedition which lasted from the 7th of December 1770 to the 30th of June
        1772, proceeded from Prince of Wales' Fort, on the Churchhill river in latitude 58d. 47½m.
        north, and longitude 94d 7½m. west of Greenwich, or 19d. west of 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>, to the mouth of the
        Coppermine river, which according to some accounts is in latitude 72d. north and longitude
        119d. west from Greenwich, or 44d. west of 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>; but is laid down by others
        to be in latitude about 69d. north, and longitude 112d. west from Greenwich or 37d. west
        from 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>. Whatever the confined
        views and contracted policy of the Hudson's Bay Company may, however, have omitted in the
        way of discovery, the enterprize and perseverance of the Canadian traders, sometime since
        united under the name of the North West Company, have amply supplied. Prior to the year
        1789 they had extended their discoveries and establishments along the numerous lakes and
        rivers situated north of that high tract of country which divides the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>waters from those which run towards
        the north and east, to within a short distance of the

        river, where it falls into the 
        <name type="place" key="North Sea">North sea</name>, in latitude 69d. 14m. north and

               <p>By the discoveries alluded to, and those occasionally made during the rapid settlement
        of the country and the progress of enterprize, the principal divisions of this Northern
        Continent has been explored and become known. The line separating these from the parts

        <name type="person" key="Hearne, Samuel">Hearne</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="McKenzie, Charles">McKenzie</name>: leaving unknown and
        unexplored (except so far as the surveys made by navigators of the coast of 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">the Pacific</name>, and the imperfect accounts of
        traders who have ascended the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>have furnished information) all that
        large intermediate tract, containing in breadth about 1000 miles; and in length in a
        direct line, about 1800 miles, and by the way of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>s nearly twice that distance.
        This tract from its situation may be supposed to contain the chief part of those lands in
        the great western division of the continent of North America fit for tillage: and this
        circumstance will therefore in a special manner claim the attention of an agricultural
        people, render more interesting a description of them, and attach additional value to the
        history of the country. It will not be forgotten that an immense sum of treasure has been
        expended in the purchase of this country, and that it is now considered as belonging to
        the United States. Here at no distant period settlements may be formed; and in a much
        shorter term than has elapsed since the first were made in America, from which hath arisen
        a great, powerful and independent nation, the posterity of the present inhabitants of the
        Union may unfurl the standard of independence on the plains of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>.</p>
               <p>With respect to the accuracy of the relations given in the following pages, it may be
        necessary to inform those readers not acquainted with the fact, that the principal object
        in sending out the expedition was to gain some correct account of the country: and that
        this might be done more effectually, and the information collected, preserved with more
        certainty, it was enjoined upon the several persons belonging to the corps, who were
        considered capable, to keep journals, and every necessary information and assistance given
        them for that purpose: these journals were also from time to time compared, corrected and
        any blanks, which had been left, filled up, and unavoidable omissions supplied. By thus
        multiplying the journals, revising and correcting them, the chances of securing to the
        country a true account of the progress of the expedition and of the discoveries which
        should be made, especially should the party be attacked and defeated by the savages or
        meet with any other disasters in their hazardous enterprize, were also multiplied.</p>
               <p>The following is an extract of a certificate delivered by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>to 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Mr. Gass</name>, dated 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>10th Oct. 1806.</p>
               <p>"As a tribute justly due to the merits of the said 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>, I with chearfulness declare,
        that the ample support, which he gave me, under every difficulty; the manly firmness,
        which he evinced on every necessary occasion; and the fortitude with which he bore the
        fatigues and painful sufferings incident to that long voyage, intitles him to my highest
        confidence and sincere thanks, while it eminently recommends him to the consideration and
        respect of his fellow citizens."</p>
               <p>In determining the form in which the work should appear, the publisher had some
        difficulty. Two plans presented themselves. The one was to preserve the form of a daily
        journal (in which the original had been kept) and give a plain description of the country
        and a simple relation of occurrences equally intelligible to all readers; leaving to every
        person an opportunity of embellishing the scenes presented to him in his own way. The
        other plan was to more fully digest the subject, make the narrative more general, and
        assuming less of the journal form and style, describe and clothe the principal parts of it
        as his fancy might suggest. However far the latter might have been proper had a foreign
        country been the subject, and the principal object of the publication, mere amusement,
        many objections occurred to it in the present case; and rendered the former the most
        eligible, especially as by it the climate and face of the country will be more
        satisfactorily described. And 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Mr. Gass</name>having declared that the beauties
        and deformities of its grandest scenes were equally beyond the power of description, no
        attempts have been either by him or the publisher to give adequate representations of
        them.</p>
               <p>The publisher hopes that the curiosity of the reader will be in some degree gratified;
        that the information furnished will not be uninteresting; and that some aid will be
        furnished those who wish to acquire a Geographical knowledge of their country.

               </p>
               <p>On presenting this Volume to my fellow Citizens, it is not necessary to enter into
        particular account of this Voyage; but I trust that the generous public, will make such
        allowances as they shall think fit, to one who has never before presented himself to them
        in the character of an Author; for which the course and occupations of my life; has by no
        means qualified me, being much better calculated to perform the Voyage (arduous as it
        might be) than to write an account of it; however it is now offered to the Public, with
        the submission that becomes me.    I was led at an early period of my life to
        enter into the Army of the United States, by views I had to acquire Military knowledge,
        &amp; to be acquainted with the Country in which I was born; and accordingly was somewhat
        gratified by being ordered (shortly after I joined the Service) to 
        <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskias</name>Village, in the 
        <name type="place" key="Illinois">Illinois</name>Country.—    I there, from
        frequent conversations, I had with Traders; whose traffic was with the Indians, residing
        on the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>River, contemplated that there might
        be a practibility of penetrating across the Continent of North America, to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>by way of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>River, but found from the most
        perfect account that I could collect from any of them; did not extend beyond the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>Nation, who inhabited on the
        same River 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>, which lays in 47° 24' 12 North
        Latitude; the Countries beyond that place, being utterly unknown to them, and even to the
        Indians inhabiting that Country.</p>
               <p>I had been at 
        <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskia</name>Village some time, when I was
        informed That His Excellency 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</name>Esquire, President of
        the United States, had appointed 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Meriweather Lewis</name>, and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain William Clark</name>, to take the command
        of a party of Continental Troops, and Volunteers; in order to explore the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>River; and find out its source; and
        to find (if possible) by that rout a passage to 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">the Pacific</name>ocean.—    I was
        fortunate in being chosen one of the party of Continental Troops by them, which
        contributed much to quicken the execution of my favorite project, and of satisfying my own
        ambition.    The dangers I have encounter'd, and the toils I have suffered, have
        found their recompence, nor will the many and tedious days, or the gloomy and inclement
        nights that I have passed, have been passed in vain.—    This Voyage I hope has
        settled the dubious point respecting the Source of the great Rivers 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>, and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>; and I trust that it has set that
        long agitated question at rest, in regard to a passage being across the Continent of North
        America, to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>, and the Northern boundary of
        Louisiana.—</p>
               <p>In this Voyage I furnished myself with books, and also got from Captains 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, every information that lay in their
        power, in order to compleat and make my Journal correct; and part of my Journals were kept
        by one of them when I was on a fataigue party.—    This was done by them, in
        case of any great accident happening to the party, so that if any of them should return to
        the United States, or their Journals fall into the hands of any civiliz'd Nation, that the
        grand object of our discovery's might not be defeated.    The object being
        accomplished, it lays with you to determine the practibility of a commercial communication
        across the continent of North America, between the 
        <name type="place" key="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>s which is proved by my
        Journal.—    Nor do I hesitate to declare, my decided opinion, that very great,
        and essential advantages, may be derived; by extending our Trade, from one Sea, to the
        other.</p>
               <p>The very great advantages of the fur trade, from that hitherto unknown Country, both by
        ascending the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>River, and by way of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>to 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">the Pacific</name>ocean, will I trust prove
        Interesting to a Nation, whose general policy, is blended with, and whose prosperity is
        supported by the persuits of commerce.—    It will also qualify the reader, to
        pursue the succeeding Voyages, with superior intelligence and satisfaction.—   
        This Voyage will not I fear afford the variety, that may be expected from it; and that
        which it offers to the Eye, is not of a nature to be effectually transferred to the Page;
        Mountains and Valleys, the vast Priaries; the wide spreading forests, the lakes and
        Rivers, on both sides of the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>, succeed each other in
        general description;</p>
               <p>The permanent Villages, both on the Rivers Missouri River, and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>; and the Inhabitants in general,
        with bands of wandering Indians, are the only people, whom I shall introduce to the
        acquaintance of my readers.—    The Buffalo, the white Bear; the Elk, the
        Antelope, the mountain Goat, &amp; the Beaver; are mostly so familiar to the Naturalists,
        and are so frequently described, that a bare mention of them, as they enliven'd the
        landscapes, or were hunted for food; with a cursory account of the soil, the course of the
        Rivers, and their various produce, is all that can reasonably be expected from me.—
           The toil of our Navigation to the source of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri</name>, was incessant; and often times
        extreme, and in our progress over the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>, with the Burthens on our
        shoulders; which aggravated the Toils of our march, and added to the wearisomeness of our
        way, adding to which the extreme dangers we encounter'd in descending the River 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>at a season of the Year, that not
        even the Natives of the soil would attempt; I hope will convince my readers, that Manly
        fortitude and perseverance was our only guide.—</p>
               <p>Though the events, which compose my Journal, may have little in itself to strike the
        imagination of those who love to be astonished; nevertheless, when it is consider'd, that
        we explored those Waters, which had never before borne any other Vessell, than the Canoe
        of the Savage; and traversed those Forests and plains, where no American Citizen, or
        European had ever before presented themselves, to the Eye of its swarthy natives; when to
        these considerations, are added, the Important objects which were pursued; with the
        dangers that were encounter'd, and the difficulties that were surmounted to attain them;
        this work will, I flatter myself, be found to excite an interest, and conciliate regard,
        in the minds of those who peruse it.—    I hope the generous public, will
        indulge me, by believing; that I have laid before them, only whatever I saw, (or were seen
        by Captains 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>or 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>) with the impression of the moment;
        that it was told by them, or presented itself to me, and have never allowed myself to
        wander into conjecture, but have given as full, and exact account of the Country, and
        other transactions, that occur'd in the Country, that we passed through, as my abilities
        would allow.    I cannot in justice to myself omit saying, that the manly, and
        soldier-like behaviour; and enterprizing abilities; of both 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>, claim my utmost gratitude:
           and the humanity shown at all times by them, to those under their command, on
        this perilous and important Voyage of discovery; I hope will ever fill the breasts of Men
        who were under their command with the 〈will〉 same, and make their characters be esteem'd
        by the American people, and mankind in general; and convince the generous Public, that the
        President of the United States, did not misplace his judgment, when he appointed them to
        the command of this party on discovery; which is of so great a magnitude and utility, to
        the United States and mankind in general.—</p>
               <p>I am not a candidate for literary fame, at the same time, I cannot but indulge the
        hope, that this volume, with all its imperfections, will not be thought unworthy the
        attention of the scientific Geographer; and that by unfolding Countries; hitherto
        unexplored, and which I presume, may be considered as a part belonging to the United
        States, it will be received as a faithful tribute to the prosperity of my Country.</p>
