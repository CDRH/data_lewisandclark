          and walked down the South West side of the river and sent 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>down the opposite side to bring
          the canoe over to me and put me across the

          and arrived with Fields this evening.    the party also arrived this evening
          with two canoes from 
          <name type="place" key="Lower portage camp">the lower camp</name>.    they
          were wet and fatiegued, gave them a dram. 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>came with them and gave me an
          account of his &amp;

          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>was still at their camp with
          the meat they had dryed.    the iron frame of my boat is 36 feet long 4½ F. in
          the beam and 26 Inches in the hole.</p>
               <p>This morning early 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>had the remaining canoe drawn
          out of the water; and divided the remainder of our baggage into three parcels, one of
          which he sent today by the party with two canoes. 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">The Indian woman</name>is now perfectly recovered. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>came a few miles this morning to
          see the party under way and returned.    on my arrival at the 
          <name type="place" key="Upper portage camp (Mont.)">upper camp</name>this morning, I
          found that 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>had made but slow progress in
          collecting timber for the boat; they complained of great difficulty in geting streight
          or even tolerably streight sticks of 4½ feet long.    we were obliged to make
          use of the willow and box alder, the cottonwood being too soft and brittle. I kept one
          of them collecting timber while the other shaved and fitted them. I have found some pine
          logs among the drift wood near this place, from which, I hope to obtain as much pitch as
          will answer to pay the seams of the boat. I directed 
          <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Fraizer</name>to remain in order to sew the
          hides together, and form the covering for the boat.</p>

          and divided the baggage into 3 parcels, one of which the party took on their backs &amp;
          one waggon with truk wheels to the Canoes 3 miles in advance    (Those Canoes

          oClock a black Cloud arose to the N West, the wind shifted from the S to that point and
          in a short time the earth was entirely Covered with hail, Some rain Succeeded, which
          Continud for about an hour very moderately on this Side of the river, without the earths

          Buffalo in Gangs &amp; flocks.—    towards Evening when we were within about 3
          Miles of the 
          <name type="place" key="Upper portage camp (Mont.)">upper Camp</name>, there came up of
          a sudden a Violent thunder shower, &amp; it rained amazingly hard; for about 15 or 20
          Minutes, in which time the water stood on the ground over our Moccasins—   
          Our Water being all gone, &amp; the Men very thirsty, they drank heartily, out of the
          puddles of water that lay in the plains—    At dusk of the Evening we arrived
          at the 
          <name type="place" key="Upper portage camp (Mont.)">upper Camp</name>and unloaded our
          Carriage, &amp; found that some of our baggage had got wet, by the rain, (that were in
          the Crafts.)—    We found 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, the Man that had left the two
          hunters, at the 
          <name type="place" key="Upper portage camp (Mont.)">upper Camp</name>.    He
          had been encamped up the 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medecine
          River</name>, &amp; had killed 3 Buffalo, 8 Deer &amp; several Antelopes, but had seen
          no Elk—</p>
