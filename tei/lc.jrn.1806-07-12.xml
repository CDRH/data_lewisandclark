               <p>we arrose early and resumed our operations in compleating our canoes which we
          completed by 10 A. M.    about this time two of the men whom I had dispatched
          this morning in quest of the horses returned with seven of them only.    the
          〈othe〉 remaining ten of our best horses were absent and not to be found. I fear that
          they 〈have〉 are stolen. I dispatch two men on horseback in surch of them.   
          the wind blew so violently that I did not think it prudent to attempt passing the
          river.—    at 〈3 PM〉 Noon 
          <name type="person" key="Werner, William">Werner</name>returned having found three

          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name>did not return untill 3 P. M.
          not having found the horses.    he had been about 8 ms. up

          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>in quest of them.
             the former returned at dark unsuccessfull and the latter continued absent
          all night.    at 5 P. M. the wind abated and we transported our baggage and
          meat to the opposite shore in our canoes which we found answered even beyond our
          expectations.    we swam our horses over also and encamped at sunset.

          river is somewhat higher than when we were here last 〈spring〉 summer.    the
          present season has been much more moist than the preceeding one.    the grass
          and weeds are much more luxouriant than they were when I left this place on the 13th of
          July 1805.— saw the brown thrush,
