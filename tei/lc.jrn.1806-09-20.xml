          Scotch gentlemen furnished us with Beef flower and Some pork for our men, and gave us a
          very agreeable supper.    as it was like to rain we accepted of a bed in one
          of their tents.    we purchased of a Citizen two gallons of Whiskey for our
          party for which we were obliged to give Eight dollars in Cash, an imposition on the part
          of the Citizen.    every person, both French and americans Seem to express
          great pleasure at our return, and acknowledged them selves much astonished in Seeing us
