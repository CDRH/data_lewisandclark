               <p>We set out at sunrise and proceeded a short distance up the North side of the river;
          we found the ravines which made in on this side were so steep and numerous that we
          passed [
          <hi rend="italic">EC?: crossed</hi>] the river in doing which the pack horse which
          carried my instruments missed the ford and wet the instruments.    this
          accident detained us about half an hor. I took the Instruments out wiped them and dryed
          their cases, they sustained no naterial injury.    we continued on the S. side
          of the river about 3 [
          <hi rend="italic">EC?: 3</hi>] miles when we again passed over to the N. side and took
          our course through the plains at some distance from the river.    we saw a
          large herd of Elk this morning.    the buffaloe still become more scarce.
             at 2 P. M. we struck a 
          <name type="place" key="Cut Bank Creek (North Branch of Marias River)">northern branch
          of Marias river</name>
                  <ref target="n37072101" n="1"/>about 30 yds. wide at the distance of about 8 miles from
          it's entrance.    this stream is closely confined between clifts of freestone
          rocks
          <ref target="n37072102" n="2"/>the bottom narrow below us and above the rocks confine
          it on each side; some little timber below but not any above; the water of this stream is
          nearly clear.    from the appearance of this rock and the apparent hight of
          the bed of the streem I am induced to beleive that there are falls in these rivers
          somewhere about their junction.    being convinced that this stream came from
          the mountains I determined to pursue it as it will lead me to the most nothern point to
          which the waters of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>extend which I now fear will
          not be as far north as I wished and expected.    after dinner we set out up
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Cut Bank Creek (North Branch of Marias River)">North
          branch</name>keeping on it's S. side; we pursued it untill dark and not finding any
          timber halted and made a fire of the dung of the buffaloe.    we lay on the
          south side in a narrow bottom under a Clift.
          <ref target="n37072103" n="3"/>   our provision is nearly out, we wounded a
          buffaloe this evening but could not get him.</p>

               <p>This morning I was informed that Half of our horses were absent. Sent out

                  <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratten</name>, and 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Shabono</name>to hunt them. 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Shabono</name>went up the river 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shanon</name>down and

          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Shabono</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratten</name>returned at 10 A M and
          informed me that they Saw no Signs of the horses. 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>proceeded on down the river
          about 14 miles and did not return untill late in the evening, he was equally
          unsuckcessfull. 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>informed me that he Saw a
          remarkable large Lodge
          <ref target="n37072105" n="5"/>about 12 miles below, covered with bushes and the top
          Deckorated with Skins &amp;c and had the appearance of haveing been built about 2 years.
          I Sent out two men on hors back to kill a fat Cow which they did and returned in 3 hours
             the men work very diligiently on the Canoes    one of them nearly
          finished ready to put in the water. 
          <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibsons</name>wound is beginning to heal. I am
          in great hope that it will get well in time for him to accompany 
          <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sgt. Pryor</name>with the horses to the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>. This evening late a very
          black Cloud from the S. E. accompanied with Thunder and lightning with hard winds which
          Shifted about and was worm and disagreeable. I am apprehensive that the indians have
          Stolen our horses, and probably those who had made the Smoke a fiew days passed towards
          the S. W. I deturmined to have the ballance of the horses guarded and for that purpose
          sent out 3 men, on their approach near the horses were So alarmed that they ran away and
          entered the woods and the men returned—    a Great number of Geese which raise
          their young on this river    passed down frequently Since my arival at this
          place.    we appear to be in the beginning of the buffalow Country.
             the plains are butifull and leavel but the Soil is but thin Stoney
          <ref target="n37072106" n="6"/>and in maney parts of the plains &amp; bottoms there are
          great quantity of prickly pears. Saw Several herds of buffalow Since I arived at this
          Camp also antilops, wolves, pigions, Dovs, Hawks, ravins, Crows, larks, Sparrows, Eagles
          &amp; bank martins
          <ref target="n37072107" n="7"/>&amp;c. &amp;c. The wolves which are the constant
          attendants of the Buffalow are in great numbers on the Scerts of those large gangues
          which are to be Seen in every direction in those praries</p>
