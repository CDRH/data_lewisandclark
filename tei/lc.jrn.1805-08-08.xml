               <p>We had a heavy dew this morning.    as one canoe had been left we had now
          more hads to spear for the chase; game being scarce it requires more hunters to supply
          us.    we therefore dispatched four this morning.    we set out at
          sunrise and continued our rout up the river which we find much more gentle and deep than
          below the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River">Wisdom river</name>it is from
          35 to 45 yards wide very crooked many short bends constituteing lage and general bends;
          insomuch that altho' we travel briskly and a considerable distance yet it takes us only
          a few miles on our general course or rout.    there is but very little timber
          on this fork principally the under brush frequently mentioned. I observe a considerably
          quantity of the buffaloe clover in the bottoms.
          <ref target="n18080801" n="1"/>   the sunflower, flax, green swoard, thistle
          and several species of the rye grass some of which rise to the hight of 3 or 4 feet.
          <ref target="n18080802" n="2"/>   there is a grass
          <ref target="n18080803" n="3"/>also with a soft smooth leaf that bears it's seeds very
          much like the timothy but it dose not grow very luxouriant or appear as if it would
          answer so well as the common timothy for meadows. I preserved some of it's seeds which
          are now ripe, thinking perhaps it might answer better if cultivated, at all events is at
          least worth the experiment.    it rises about 3 feet high.    on a
          direct line about 2 miles above our encampment of this morning we passed the entrance of
          
          <name type="place" key="Ruby (Philanthropy) River">Philanthrophy River</name>which
          discharges itself by 2 channels a small distance assunder. this river from it's size and
          S. Eastwardly course no doubt heads with 
          <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madisons river</name>in the snowey
          mountains visible in that direction.
          <ref target="n18080804" n="4"/>   at Noon 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name>arrived and reported that he
          had been up 
          <name type="place" key="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River">Wisdom river</name>some miles
          above where it entered the mountain and could find nothing of 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, he had killed a deer and an
          Antelope.    great quantity of beaver Otter and musk-rats in these rivers.
             two of the hunters we sent out this morning returned at noon had killed
          each a deer and an Antelope.    we use the seting poles today almost
          altogether.    we encamped on the Lard side
          <ref target="n18080805" n="5"/>where there was but little timber were obliged to use
          willow brush for fuel; the rosebushes and bryers were very thick. the hunters brought in
          another deer this evening.    te tumor on 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clarks</name>ankle has discharged a
          considerable quantity of matter but is still much swolen and inflamed and gives him
          considerable pain.    saw a number of Gees ducks and some Crains today.
             the former begin to fly.—</p>
               <p>the evening again proved cloudy much to my mortification and prevented my making any
          lunar observations.    
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">the Indian woman</name>recognized the point of a
          high plain to our right which she informed us was not very distant from the summer
          retreat of her nation on a river beyond the mountains which runs to the west.
             this hill she says her nation calls 
          <name type="place" key="Beaverhead Rock">the beaver's head</name>from a conceived
          remblance of it's figure to the head of that animal.
          <ref target="n18080806" n="6"/>   she assures us that we shall either find
          her people on this river or on the river immediately west of it's source; which from
          it's present size cannot be very distant.    as it is now all important with
          us to meet with those people as soon as possible, I determined 〈to leave the charge of
          the party, and the care of the lunar observations to 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>; and〉 to proceed tomorrow
          with a small party to the source of the principal stream of this river and pass the
          mountains to the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>; and down that river untill I
          found the Indians; in short it is my resolusion to find them or some others, who have
          horses if it should cause me a trip of one month. for without horses we shall be obliged
          to leave a great part of our stores, of which, it appears to me that we have a stock
          already sufficiently small for the length of the voyage before us.</p>
