               <p>Nothing worthy of notice occurred today.    our fare is the flesh of lean
          elk boiled with pure water, and a little salt.    the whale blubber which we
          have used very sparingly is now exhausted.    on this food I do not feel
          strong, but enjoy the most perfect health;—    a keen appetite supplys in a
          great degree the want of more luxurious sauses or dishes, and still render my ordinary
          meals not uninteresting to me, for I find myself sometimes enquiring of the cook whether
          dinner or breakfast is ready.—

               <p>The 
          <hi rend="italic">Sac a commis</hi>is the growth of high dry situations, and invariably
          in a piney country or on it's borders.    it is generally found in the open
          piney woodland as on the Western side of the Rocky mountain but in this neighbourhood we
          find it only in the praries or on their borders in the more open wood lands; a very rich
          soil is not absolutely necessary, as a meager one frequently produces it abundantly.
             the natives on this side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockey mountains</name>who can procure this
          berry invariably use it; to me it is a very tasteless and insippid fruit.   
          this shrub is an evergreen, the leaves retain their virdure most perfectly through the
          winter even in the most rigid climate as on 
          <name type="place" key="Lake Winnipeg">lake Winnipic</name>.
          <ref target="n28012902" n="2"/>   the root of this shrub puts forth a great
          number of stems which seperate near the surface of the ground; each stem from the size
          of a small quill to that of a man's finger; these are much branched the branches forming
          an accute angle with the stem, and all more poperly pocumbent than creeping, for altho'
          it sometimes puts forth radicles from the stem and branches which strike obliquely into
          the ground, these radicles are by no means general, equable in their distances from each
          other nor do they appear to be calculated to furnish nutriment to the plant but reather
          to hold he stem or branch in it's place.    the bark is formed of several thin
          layers of a smoth thin brittle substance of a dark or redish brown colour easily
          seperated from the woody stem in flakes. the leaves with rispect to their position are
          scatered yet closely arranged near the extremities of the twigs particularly.
             the leaf is about ¾ of an inch in length and about half that in width, is
          oval but obtusely pointed, absolutely entire, thick, smoth, firm, a deep green and
          slightly grooved, the leaf is supported by a small footstalk of proportionable length.
             the berry is attatched in an irregular and scattered manner to the small
          boughs among the leaves, tho' frequently closely arranged, but always supported by
          seperate short and small peduncles, the insertion of which poduces a slight concavity in
          the bury while it's opposite side is slightly convex; the form of the berry is a
          spheroid; the shorter diameter being in a line with the peduncle.—    this
          berry is a pericarp the outer coat of which is a thin firm tough pellicle, the inner
          part consists of a dry mealy powder of a yellowish white colour invelloping from four to
          six proportionably large hard light brown seeds each in the form of a section of a
          spheroid which figure they form when united, and are destitute of any membranous
          covering.—    the colour of this fruit is a fine scarlet.    the
          natives usually eat them without any preperation.    the fruit ripens in
          september and remains on the bushes all winter. the frost appears to take no effect on
          it. these berries are sometimes geathered and hung in their lodges in bags where they
          dry without further trouble, for in their most succulent state they appear to be almost
          as dry as flour.—</p>

          hat—    the hat at top termonates in a pointed knob of a conic form, or in

          on these hats they work various figures of different colours, but most commonly only
          black and white are employed. these figures are faint representations of the whale, the
          Canoes and the harpooners Strikeing them.    Sometimes Square dimonds triangle

          length, the longest from 9 to 10 incs. and the Shorter one from 3 to 5 inches.

        1806 writing in this notebook, beginning after some statistical materials he had already

        appears as Codex I, with the principal writing coming from the other end of the book. See
