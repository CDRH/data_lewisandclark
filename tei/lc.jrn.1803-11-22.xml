                  <hi rend="italic">Missilanious remarks &amp;ec.</hi>Set out at ½ after 6 A M. the
          current very rapid and difficult.    (1) the iner part of every bend of this
          river where it makes any considerable turn is always filled with Island of different
          shapes and sizes; this remark applys to every part of this river so far as we have yet
          asscended.—    at the expiration of this course saw some 
          <hi rend="italic">Heth hens</hi>or grows—    one of my men went on shore and
          killed one of them, of which we made soome soup for my friend 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>who had been much indisposed
          since the 16th inst. this bird shall hereafter be more particularly discribed.—
             (2) arrived oposite three new habitation of some Americans who had settled
          under the spanish government, this settlement is on a bottom called, 
          <hi rend="italic">Tywappety,</hi>
                  <ref target="n02112201" n="1"/>the bank is high: called at the uper habitation—
             from the center of the river oposite this settlement a large Island
          <ref target="n02112202" n="2"/>appears a head dist 1½ and gives much the appearance to
          the river of it's forking or reather resieving a very considerable river on the Lard.
          side—    was informed by a 
          <name type="person" key="Findley, Charles">Mr. Findley</name>
                  <ref target="n02112203" n="3"/>the owener of this habitation that there were fifteen
          families in this settlement—    I took the hight of this bank above the
          present state of the water which was considered as very low and found it's elivation 32
          feet 6 inches; this bottom seldom overflows at least not since the present settlement
          has been formed which has been about 4 years—    overtook two keels
          <ref target="n02112204" n="4"/>from 
          <name type="place" key="Louisville, Ky.">Lousville</name>bound to 
          <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskias</name>loaded with dry goods and
          whiskey, belonging to 
          <name type="person" key="Bullitt, Thomas or Cuthbert">Mr. Bullet</name>
                  <ref target="n02112205" n="5"/>of 
          <name type="place" key="Louisville, Ky.">Louisville</name>: this place by the
          computation of the inhabitants is 25 miles above the mouth of the 
          <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio</name>but by my estimate is only 22 miles.
             (3) one [island] of which on Lard. qutr. is about three miles in length and
          nearly the same in bredth    oposite to the upper end of this Isld. met two
          Keeled boats loaded with firs for 
          <name type="place" key="New Orleans, La.">New-Orleans</name>; at the same place on the
          Stard. the land appears not usually to be overflowed being covered with a considerable
          portion of poplar and white-oak timber, tho' the bank is several feet lower than that I
          measured this forenoon; this is the first poplar or white oak I have seen since we began
          to asscend the river; I have seen but little 
          <hi rend="italic">cain</hi>
                  <ref target="n02112206" n="6"/>since we left the 
          <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio</name>, and my pilot informed me that from
          hence up the river there is not any in the neighbourhood of it; the banks appear every
          where to abound with the 
          <hi rend="italic">sand</hi>or 
          <hi rend="italic">scrubing Rush</hi>,
          <ref target="n02112207" n="7"/>it grows much thicker, and arrises to a much greater
          hight in the bottoms of this river than I ever observed it elsewhere, I measured a stalk
          of it which was 8 feet 2 inches in length &amp; 3⅛ inches in circumpherence; it grows as
          thick comparitively as the stalks of luxurient wheat; It rises in a single steem without
          branch or leaf being jointed at the distance of 1 ½ to 2 inches; it retains it's colour
          which is a deep green through the winter and affords an agreeable and healthy food for
          both cattle and horses; these I am informed will keep in fine order on them through the
          winter which, however is never very inte[n]se in this climate. the favorite soil for
          this plant is a rich loam intermixed with a considerable portion of sand.—   
          the oak and poplar land before noticed continues on the Stad. side for several miles,
          and finally joins the highland which there puts in to the river—    (4) we
          here kept close to the main shore on Stard qtr.—    from the best estimate I
          could make the river appears to be in breadth including Islands from 1 ½ to 3 miles and
          the main chanel of it usually ½ mile wide—    this character of the river will
          apply to it from the mouth of 
          <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio</name>to this place.    (5) the upper
          point of this Island is oposite to the uper point of 
          <name type="place" key="Tywappity Bottom">Tywoppety bottom</name>, there appears to be a
          hadsome farm at this point, and here the highland or main shore puts in with a much
          greater hight of land than we have seen since we began to asscend it appears to be a
          ridg pointing obliquely don the river    the hight of it from it's appearance
          is most probably 100 feet above the level of the bottom.—    from the water's
          edge to the top of the first rise or level of the bottom wass pretty well covered with
          large rock of many tons weight lying in a loose manner on the serface or but partially
          bedded in the earth—    on the stard. side I went on shore and soon arrived at
          some highland, it being not more than 200 paces to the base of the rising ground which
          rises pretty suddonly to the hight of 100 Feet. the land is of an inferior quality on
          these hills being a stiff white clay soil.—    observed a very fine quarry of
          white freestone on the Eastern bank of a small run which made into the river, from which
          the quarry is about half a mile.    also observed some large mass of loose
          rocks nearly at the summits of these hills, these rocks appeared very heard, being
          formed of such pebbles as common to the river, united together by a strong scement of
          fine sand; with a small proportion of earth.—    this quality so remarkable
          and observable in the waters of 
          <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio</name>of scementing masses of pebble earth and
          sand, as also pretrefying vegitable and animal substances exposed to it for a length of
          time; this quality seems to be possessed equally by this river; of this I have had many
          evidences; beside those large masses of conjealed or scemented pebble, I met with
          several pieces of wood that had been petrefyed and afterwards woarn away by the gravel
          and the agetatition of the water untill they had become smothe and had the appearance of
          stone common to runing streams; tho' the grain of the wood was quite distinct.

          quat.
          <ref target="n02112209" n="9"/>and lay upon a slate rock which here formed the beech;
          this slate appeared to ly in a vain of not more than 2 feet thick and seemed to be of an
          indifferent quality. one of my men [
          <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Nathaniel Pryor</name>] who went out to
          hunt this morning has not yet come up, had several guns fired to bring him too, and the
          horn freequently blown but without effect—    I have frequently observed among
          the sand and pebble of the river a substance that resembled 
          <hi rend="italic">pit-coal</hi>but which evedently is wood that has remained a great
          length of time berried in the mud of the mois[t] banks of the river, &amp; when these
          banks are again washed away becomes exposed to view    the gain of the wood is
          easily persieved as 〈is〉 was also the bark of some spesimines I met with which had not
          so perfectly assumed the coal state; I burnt some of this coal but found it indifferent,
          nor could I discover while it was berning that it emitted any sulphurious smell.
