               <p>The winter at 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>gave 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>their first extended opportunity to
          fulfill one of the expedition's most important objectives. 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had instructed 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>in June 1803 to gather, record,
          and analyze a vast amount of information about the Indians in the West and Pacific
          Northwest. Although 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>final document did not
          quite match the complex set of questions about the Indians proposed by his scientific
          consultants, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had little doubt that their
          ethnographic assignment had a high priority. The captains understood that they were to
          do more than count native noses and list languages. From the beginning of the
          expedition, virtually every diarist in it diligently recorded all sorts of information
          about Indian life. But the demands of time and travel made thorough study difficult. It
          was not until the winter with the 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>that 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>could seriously undertake studies
          in Indian ethnography.</p>
               <p>Disguised as travelers, traders, missionaries, and explorers, ethnographers were part
          of the American frontier from its earliest times. They recorded their impresssions of
          the strange and exotic cultures they encountered, often without fully realizing they
          were engaged in ethnographic study. These pioneer ethnographers described Indian life on
          a part-time basis, considering such activity incidental to their primary tasks. They
          included Jesuit missionaries in 
          <name type="place" key="Canada">Canada</name>, who studied Indian ways in order to save
          lost souls, and fur merchants, who noted native exchange systems to facilitate future
          trade operations. As part-time observers of native cultures, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>belonged to a long tradition in
          North America that included Father Paul Le Jeune, James Adair, Nicolas Perrot, and the
          captains' contemporaries 
          <name type="person" key="Henry, Alexander (younger)">Alexander Henry the
          Younger</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Pike, Zebulon Montgomery">Zebulon Pike</name>. Everything these
          men noted about the Indians—clothing, houses, village locations, languages, customs, and
          economy—they recorded in the service of business enterprise, government policy, or
          religious zeal. They made no pretense at being scientific observers. As valuable as they
          are, their ethnographic records are imperfect, incomplete pieces of evidence. It would
          be unreasonable to expect that 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>painted a unified, coherent
          portrait of any Indian culture. They simply did not think in those terms. But they did
          leave behind journals and maps that comprise pieces of an intricate puzzle.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, and the other journalists in their
          party were ethnographers, not ethnologists. The distinction is important since it bears
          directly on how the explorers viewed their work and the results of it. Ethnologists
          study diverse cultures with an eye toward creating widely applicable concepts of social
          development and behavior. In this century they have become full-time specialists
          committed to accurate, objective observation. 
          <ref target="n0501" n="1"/>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>would have understood the modern
          desire for accuracy but not the passion for impartiality. Only rarely did they assume an
          air of cool detachment and scientific objectivity in their dealings with the Indians.
          Disinterested observation was the farthest thing from their minds. Because the captains
          were confident of their own cultural superiority, they never doubted the wisdom of
          judging Indians by white standards. For 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, every observation was also a
          judgment. Those judgments are plain in the explorers' comments about the feisty 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
                  <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Sioux.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>
                  </ref>and the sharp 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Chinook Indians">Chinook</name>traders. For instance, 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>could not describe the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>practice of feeding buffalo
          skulls without pausing to damn native superstition. 
          <ref target="n0502" n="2"/>But the captains' confidence did not often become swaggering
          arrogance—something that cannot be said for those who came later. Fortunately, their
          cultural biases did not prevent them from asking the right ethnographic questions.
          Equally fortunate, they had the good sense to write down most Indian answers, including
          many that seemed bewildering at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>began their ethnographic work at 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>by simplifying and
          streamlining 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>detailed questions
          covering seventeen areas of Indian life and culture. Those questions touched on
          everything from language and law to trade and technology. The expedition was to record
          what the Indians wore, what they ate, how they made a living, and what they believed in.
          But long before coming to their winter quarters, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>realized that they would have
          neither the time nor the linguistic ability to ask all of 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>questions. Their "Estimate
          of the Eastern Indians" contained nineteen questions that now seemed important to the
          expedition. Special attention was given to each Indian group's tribal name, location,
          population, language, and potential for American trade. Questions about religious
          traditions, medical practices, or cultural values were quietly dropped from the official
          list. This did not mean the expedition was unwilling to record that sort of data. During
          the winter with the 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>, journal entries noted creation myths, migration legends, burial practices, and
          sacred rituals. It does suggest that the captains very sensibly recognized their
          limitations during the winter and decided to use their time and resources to gather
          material on the externals of Indian life. They concentrated on how Indians looked but
          did not give systematic attention to native souls and psyches. Their commitment to
          externals can be seen in their treatment of Indian architecture. Although the
          expedition's record contains fine exterior descriptions of tepees, earth lodges, and
          plank houses, it has little to say about their interiors. Later, artists like Karl
          Bodmer, George Catlin, and Paul Kane would take us inside those houses.</p>
               <p>Time, circumstances, and talent limited the expedition's study of Indian subjects.
          The explorers were inquisitive about the world around them, and they had 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>methodical approach to
          guide them. But the Corps of Discovery was not quite prepared for the vast ethnographic
          enterprise proposed in the "Estimate." Relying on their good sense, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>used four techniques that had long
          been the mainstays of North American ethnography. First, the captains directly
          questioned both Indians and whites, often at great length. Second, they collected
          objects—everything from 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>corn and tobacco seeds to
          a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>buffalo skin painting.
          Third, they reported what could be concluded from firsthand observation. Occasionally,
          they obtained information a fourth way, by participating with the Indians in hunts,
          games, or ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Of the four methods used by 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, interviews yielded the most
          valuable information. Since the fort was within easy walking distance of the two 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages, there were more 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>informants than 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>ones. Scores of 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>men and women visited the
          expedition's quarters for all sorts of reasons, but when it came to ethnographic
          research the most welcome guests were 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Little Raven</name>, and two
          leading men from 
          <name type="place" key="Mitutanka (Matootonha) village">Mitutanka</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Big Man (Oh-he-nar)">Big Man (Ohheenar)</name>, an adopted

                  </ref>, and 
          <name type="person" key="Coal, The (Sho-ta-harro-ra)">Coal (Shotaharrora)</name>, an
          adopted 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>. It was very important
          that these chiefs and "considerable men" be courted and closely questioned. For
          generations, chiefs and elders had served as tribal historians, committing to memory a
          whole body of past experience and tradition. 
          <ref target="n0503" n="3"/>Without the help of these men, the 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>ethnographic record would have been
          meager and unreliable. Of the two principal 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>chiefs, 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>was the most valued by
          the expedition's ethnographers. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>characterized 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>as a man of
          "integrety, firmness, inteligence and perspicuety of mind." 
          <ref target="n0504" n="4"/>The chief made at least seventeen visits to 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, some lasting many
          days. During those visits he often related "little Indian aneckd
          <hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>, [anecdotes]." 
          <ref target="n0505" n="5"/>But like the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>traditions 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>dismissed as not worth mentioning,
          many pieces of 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>history and belief shared
          by 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>were not recorded in
          the journals. Later in the voyage, when the captains had sharpened their ethnographic
          skills, they would now and then take time to preserve that sort of priceless detail.</p>
               <p>If there were plenty of 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>informants, there were far
          fewer from the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>villages. As noted
          earlier, several factors limited the expedition's access to 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>information. Some 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>chiefs, including 
          <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne</name>, were away on winter
          hunts. More important, there was lasting suspicion and hostility among the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>, especially in 
          <name type="place" key="Menetarra village">Menetarra</name>, about the intentions and
          behavior of the American party. Many of them were alarmed by the expedition's weapons
          and the size of 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. Some elders resented
          what they called the captains' "High sounding language" and several warriors were
          angered by the explorers' boasts about American military might. Such tensions, often
          fueled by the 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>s</ref>' malicious rumors,
          kept many 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>away from the fort and
          made them reluctant to entertain the captains at the 
          <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>villages.</p>
               <p>The simple fact was that 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>desperately needed the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas'</name>information. The
          explorers knew that 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>(but not 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>) raiding parties ranged
          far west to the slopes of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</name>. These parties could provide
          knowledge not only valuable for the second year of the expedition's travel but essential
          for its ethnographic assignment. Since 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>visitors to 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>were few, those who did
          come were given special attention. 
          <ref target="n0506" n="6"/>They included

               <p>Because formal interviews demanded both time and translation, much ethnographic
          information came from personal observation. While always seeing and evaluating through
          non-Indian eyes, the Americans usually managed to record what they witnessed with
          considerable accuracy. The expedition's ethnographers were especially interested in
          observing and setting down details of Indian material culture. What fascinated them were
          the ordinary things of Indian life—clothing, weapons, food, and houses. During the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>winter, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>made important observations on Upper
          
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>native life. A look at their
          distinctive contributions can help chart the growing sophistication of their
          ethnography.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>observation was sharpened by his
          growing skills as a frontier diplomat and negotiator. Although the future 
          <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>superintendent of Indian
          affairs sometimes found time to record the presence of a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>sun dance post or a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>migration story, his real
          interest was what might be called political ethnography. He wanted to know who had
          formal political and military power, the ways that power was exercised, and how it was
          passed from generation to generation. Whenever possible, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>questioned both Indians and whites
          about native leadership. But when that was not possible, he relied on his own eyes. He
          carefully watched Indians such as 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>for clues in their behavior
          that might reveal the patterns of Indian polity.</p>
               <p>Interested in the etiquette of Indian politics and diplomacy, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>quickly recognized the role of
          tobacco and smoking in all decision-making. Tobacco was, he wrote, "an article
          indispenceable in those cases."
          <ref target="n0514" n="14"/>When the explorer took part in discussions with chiefs and
          elders, he was careful to record the ritual procedures that dominated all native
          councils. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had been a perceptive political
          observer from the beginning of the voyage, although in many cases his perceptions were
          not translated into diplomatic action. By the first winter, he had grasped the
          fundamentals of Indian diplomacy as well as any veteran of northern plains life. After
          visiting 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>at the end of October
          1804, he painstakingly described the protocol of the meeting with its rituals of
          smoking, proper seating, and the placing of a buffalo robe over his shoulders.
          <ref target="n0515" n="15"/>Behind 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>recording of such observations
          was an intensely practical motive. Future American diplomats in the West would need to
          know Indian ways just as the French and English had had to bend their diplomatic manners
          to suit the requirements of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Huron Indians">Hurons</name>and

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>political observations scattered
          throughout his winter journal entries, his ability to understand native politics was
          best expressed in notes taken by 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>. In answer to 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>general question about 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>chiefs, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>offered a long summary of his
          political observations. "The throne of the 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>," he explained, "generally descends from the chief to his son if he is able, or
          promises to be able to direct the military movements of warriors." Unlike so many other
          non-Indian observers, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not suggest that the "throne of
          the 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>" assumed some sort of coercive power over ordinary villagers. Grasping the
          essential reality of Indian leadership on the northern plains, he realized that "the
          power of the chief is rather the influence of character than the force of authority." 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>found that chiefs could not become
          petty tyrants without incurring the disapproval of others equally powerful. "Power," he
          wrote, "is merely the acquiescence of the warriors in the superior merit of a chief "
          Extensive observation had taught him that Indian decisions on everything from war to
          individual transgressions were reached after careful, often time-consuming deliberation
          in council. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>told 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>, "The chief does nothing
          without consulting the old men." He noted that the council was "formed not by
          appointment, but the most respectable old men are asked for their advice."

          not reveal that ownership of important tribal bundles as well as military prowess was
          essential for chiefs. And he did assume incorrectly that there was one 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>nation with a single Grand
          Chief. But those shortcomings aside, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>proved to be an astute observer of
          the chiefs, the councils, and the polity they represented. Unlike most Europeans who
          insisted on imposing their notions of coercive leadership on native cultures, he got the
          fundamentals right.

          drawn to the commonplace in Indian life. 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>journal is filled with notes on
          those ordinary objects and actions that characterized Upper 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>Indian cultures. The sergeant was
          never systematic in his observations. He simply looked at and wrote about what seemed
          unusual or interesting to him. Blessed with an inquisitive mind, a good vocabulary, and
          a clear writing style, young 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>set down those telling details
          ignored by others. One of his habits throughout the journey was to do some informal
          exploring on his own, poking and probing around Indian villages to satisfy his
          curiosity. On one such jaunt early in the winter, 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>examined and described 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>burial practices. With an
          accuracy that rivals George Catlin's later painting of the same subject, the explorer
          explained that "the form of these savages burying their dead is after they have deceased
          they fix a Scaffel on raised 4 forks about 8 or 10 feet from the ground." 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>noted that corpses were wrapped in
          buffalo robes and placed on top of the burial scaffolds. Without mentioning the skull
          circles observed later by Catlin and Prince Maximilian, 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>correctly noted the location of
          burial grounds outside village palisades. He also made a telling observation about
          Indian mourning practices: "When any of them loose a particklor friend or relation they
          morn and cry for some time after."

          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>took note of Indian cooking and food
          preservation. The 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>diet of beans, corn,
          squash, and meat appealed to him, and in his simple style he reported that the Indians
          "live very well." Methods of storing food also attracted his attention. Villagers had
          long constructed elaborate underground bell-shaped food caches to preserve corn, beans,
          sunflower seeds, and dried squash over the winter. When 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>accompanied

               <p>Perhaps 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>most arresting ethnographic
          observation during the winter with the

                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>was a description of one of the most popular games played throughout Indian North
          America. Known as the game of hoop and pole, the sport was found among almost every
          Indian group north of 
          <name type="person" key="Mexico">Mexico</name>. Although there was considerable
          diversity in equipment and scoring, the game basically involved hurling a spear or
          shooting an arrow at a hoop or ring. Scoring depended on the accuracy of the strike
          toward the ring. Among the Upper 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>villages the game called for a
          large cleared, level playing space, long sticks with thongs to catch in the target
          rings, and flat clay targets. Because the long throwing sticks looked like billiard
          cues, later white observers insisted that the

               <p>On a cold, stormy day in mid-December 1804,

          the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages for some corn
          trading. Despite the inclement weather, the Americans found a number of chiefs and
          warriors outside playing the hoop and pole game. 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>wrote the following account of the

          had a place fixed across about 50 yards to the 2 chiefs lodge, which was Smothe as a
          house flour. They had a Battery fixed for the rings to Stop against. Two men would run

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>an opportunity to study
          battle-axe styles used by the warriors. He described the weapon as a thin, iron blade
          "from 7 to nine iches in length and from 4 ¾ to 6 inches on its edge, from whence the
          sides proceed nearly in a straight line to the eye where its width is generally not more
          than an inch." Mounted on a handle some fourteen inches long, the whole weapon weighed
          about a pound. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>found the weapon's blow
          "uncertain and easily avoided." The American soldier was even less impressed with
          earlier versions of the instrument. This precise description of the axe was accompanied
          by a quick but accurate sketch of the weapon.

          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>friends that the process
          came to them from a "Spanish prisoner," perhaps an Indian held captive somewhere in the

          <name type="place" key="Grand (We-tar-hoo and similar spellings) River (S. Dak.)">Grand

          steps, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>watched intently and probably
          took ample notes. From those notes and his own memory he was able to write a remarkably
          graphic and precise description of glass bead-making. That description included not only
          the steps in the process but the materials and equipment necessary for a successful
          result. Not satisfied with simply recounting the molding, firing, and tempering
          techniques, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>also noted how the beads were
          used. "The Indians," he explained, "are extreemly fond of the large beads formed by this
          process. They use them as pendants to their years [ears], or hair and sometimes wear
          them about their necks."

          came at the end of the 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>season as the
          expedition was preparing for its second year of travel. To provide shelter for
          themselves, the interpreters, Sacagawea, and her child Jean Baptiste, the captains
          purchased a buffalo skin tepee. The expedition had seen tepees early in the journey
          among the

          elivated and their lower extremities are spread in a circular manner to a width

          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>penchant for the homey detail. He

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>brought to ethnography the
          practiced eye of one who delighted in describing and cataloging the creatures of the
          natural world.</p>
               <p>From their earliest travels in the Americas, Europeans collected and sometimes stole
          what seemed to them attractive Indian souvenirs. At first those artifacts were seen as
          mere curiosities, conversation pieces for princes and merchants. But by the eighteenth
          century such "cabinets of curiosities" had become the core of serious scientific
          collections of ethnological specimens. 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>shared that impulse to
          assemble and analyze objects from cultures throughout the world. Just as the Royal
          Society instructed 
          <name type="person" key="Cook, James">Capt. James Cook</name>to gather representative
          samples of South Pacific material culture, so did 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>urge his captains to collect
          articles typical of Indian life along the route.</p>
               <p>Most of the expedition's collecting reflected 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>interest in natural history as
          well as 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>desire to catalog the
          plants, animals, and mineral resources of the newly acquired territories. Despite a
          focus on the land and its products, there was time to gather some Indian objects. On
          April 3, 1805, as the expedition was making final preparations for leaving 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>drafted a list of all those

          <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Warfington's</name>keelboat crew. Among

          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>interest in scientific
          agriculture, the explorers included a generous sample of the produce of Upper 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>villagers. 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>tobacco seeds, a carrot
          of their distinctive tobacco, and an ear of 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>corn were the captains'
          harvest for the gardener of 
          <name type="place" key="Monticello (Va.)">Monticello</name>. Clothing was also included
          in the Indian collection sent downriver. Four buffalo robes and "some articles of Indian
          dress" wrapped in a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>robe were placed in the
          second numbered box to show the curious back home something of native fashion.</p>
               <p>That second box also contained the most arresting object collected during the winter.
          On a large buffalo skin a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>artist had portrayed in

          further represented by a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>bow and quiver of arrows.
          The bow is the only object in the assembly whose provenance can be traced in the
          expedition's journals. Early in February 1805, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>paid a social call on 
          <name type="person" key="Black Cat (Posecopsahe)">Black Cat</name>. During the visit he
          was presented with a bow by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>chief, most likely the same
          bow sent along with some arrows in the 
          <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>-bound boxes. Rounding out the
          Indian collection was a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>clay pot "used for culinary
          purposes."
          <ref target="n0526" n="26"/>
               </p>
               <p>A review of the Indian objects collected by the expedition reenforces the impresssion
          that the explorers were bent on studying the externals of native life. Weapons,
          clothing, pottery, seeds, and a skin depicting a battle all suggest what 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>thought was important for
          understanding villager ways. Nothing was sent back to reveal the rich ceremonial life in
          
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>towns. For the pragmatic
          Americans more interested in natural resources than in supernatural practices,
          collecting seeds made more sense than trying to get Indians to part with pieces of
          ritual paraphernalia. What emerged from the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>winter collection was a
          perception of the village Indians as warriors and farmers. It would take
          nineteenth-century artists like George Catlin and Karl Bodmer and explorers like Prince
          Maximilian to broaden that narrow image.</p>
               <p>Much of the winter of 1804-1805 was a shared experience with Indian neighbors. With
          so many friendly villages close at hand, it was natural that both explorers and natives
          should participate in all sorts of activities. From formal rituals and largescale hunts
          to more intimate encounters, the expedition's members learned about Indians by living
          parts of villager culture. Because the 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Mandan.html" rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  </ref>and 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>did not schedule major
          rituals like the creation drama called the Okipa during the winter, the explorers did
          not witness those powerful ceremonies. However, the Americans did participate in the
          buffalo-calling rites during January 1805 and saw a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>war medicine dance the same
          month.</p>
               <p>Excluded by the calendar from the important public rituals, the explorers did gain
          much information about Indian life by taking part in less spectacular but perhaps more
          typical events. On a hunting trip with 
          <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>observed the plains custom of
          marking ownership of downed animals. As he related it to 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, buffalo carcasses without
          identifying arrows in them could be claimed by anyone needing meat.
          <ref target="n0527" n="27"/>From eating in earth lodges the explorers learned about
          village menus and food preparation. Participation in some aspects of Indian daily life
          did not mean that the Americans changed their own cultural identity. But sharing some of
          the joys, troubles, and labor of a Dakota winter did give the expedition's ethnographers
          a sense of authority when they wrote about Indian life.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not gather information out of
          idle curiosity. Although never attempting any complete picture of village life, they
          gave purpose and method to their ethnographic enterprise. That methodology can be best
          seen in their "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." More than random entries in their
          journals, the "Estimate" was the showpiece of their ethnography. Drafted by 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during the winter, the document was
          a massive effort to organize and compare data on nearly fifty tribes and bands. In
          concept and design it was as scientific as expedition ethnography ever got. Organized in
          tabular form and structured around nineteen questions, the "Estimate" recorded such
          things as tribal names, location, population, languages, and potential for American
          trade. Although 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and

                  </ref>, was a kind of statistical geography of those tribes they had already met, those
          yet to be encountered, and those who might influence United States Indian policy. And
          that is really what the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" proved to be—a limited but
          practical document for government agents and fur traders.</p>
               <p>Although the "Estimate" was the key document produced by the expedition's
          ethnographers during the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>season, other records from
          that period contained information about the Indians. 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</name>, who had long been
          interested in Indian languages, provided the captains with blank vocabulary sheets as a
          means to collect and preserve native words and phrases.

          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>that great care was
          exercised in getting each sound properly recorded. Writing years after the expedition 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>declared that 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>"never miss[ed] an opportunity
          of taking a vocabulary." The trader 
          <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Charles">Charles Mackenzie</name>verified the
          explorers' commitment to language study, noting their struggles to capture words
          translated through several speakers. Knowing just how tense relations were between the
          American party and the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>-proper makes the
          expedition's successful effort to obtain a vocabulary from one of 
          <name type="person" key="Le Borgne (One Eye)">Le Borgne's</name>brothers a genuine
          accomplishment. All told, the captains gathered some fourteen word lists to be sent
          downriver at the end of the winter. One of the lasting tragedies was that all that work
          was lost or misplaced after the expedition returned.
          <ref target="n0530" n="30"/>
               </p>
               <p>Although those lost lists cannot be studied for their linguistic content, it is
          important to recognize the sorts of words and phrases sought out by the expedition.
          Reflecting 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>commitment to useful
          knowledge, the blank vocabularies reveal a set of some 315 words needed for simple
          conversations between Indians and traders or government officials. The explorers were to
          gather classes of words ranging from Indian equivalents for simple numbers to the names
          of common animals. Names of the seasons, kinds of trees and plants, labels for family
          relationships, and words for basic human emotions were all to be included in the
          collecting process. Neither so utilitarian as the simple trading phrase vocabularies
          written by Hudson's Bay Company employees nor so complex as the dictionaries compiled
          later in the century by linguists working for the Bureau of American Ethnology, the 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>vocabularies represent an attempt

               <p>Most of the ethnographic data collected by the expedition was recorded in journal
          entries, the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians," and the now-lost vocabularies. But there
          were two additional sources of Indian information, which bring to light important
          aspects of native life as well as the fundamental contribution made by Indians to the
          expedition. Throughout the winter with the

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>carefully gathered material in

          Writing in his journal on January 7, 1805,

          "a connected plott from the information of Traders, Indians &amp; my own observation

          period of information gathering and analysis, while a specialist in historical
          cartography has described it as "one of the most significant maps produced by the

          views of their own physical environment as well as their ways of conveying those views

               <p>Histories of North American exploration have often slighted the role of the Indians

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and

          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>mapmakers to the American
          enterprise. During the months of December and January, as 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was hard at work on his western
          map, three important Indian-mapping sources became available to him. On December 17, he
          got from 
          <name type="person" key="Heney, Hugh">Heney</name>"some sketches which he had obtained
          from the Indians to the West of this place." Just who those western Indians were or what
          information was contained in those sketches is not clear from the surviving evidence.
          However, 
          <name type="person" key="Heney, Hugh">Heney</name>was highly regarded by the captains
          and any data he had from Indian sources was bound to get serious consideration. Early in
          January, as 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>continued work on his map, the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>chief 
          <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>visited the fort and
          provided more valuable information.

          the high Mountains, &amp; on the south Side of the River Rejone [
          <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>]." The chief explained
          that six small rivers emptied into the 
          <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>on the south, that the land
          was hilly and heavily timbered, and that there were "Great numbers of beaver." Guided by
          
          <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke's</name>words or perhaps his

          On January 16 the expedition did receive an unmistakably Indian map from a visiting 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>chief. "This war chief,"
          wrote 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, "gave us a Chart in his way of
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missourie</name>." Because 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>raiders had personal
          knowledge of lands and peoples up to and sometimes beyond the 
          <name type="place" key="Continental Divide">Continental Divide</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>always placed high value on their
          reports. But 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>phrase "a Chart in his way" hints
          at both the means the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>cartographer chose to
          construct his map and the problems the American explorer had in interpreting it.</p>
               <p>As 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>explained later to 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>, Indian maps came in several
          shapes and forms. Some were flat drawings made on skins or mats while others were
          three-dimensional relief maps made in sand, "hills designated by raising sand, rivers by
          hollow etc." Although it is not certain which method had been employed in making this 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>map, there was no doubt
          that working with it posed serious problems. Accustomed to dealing with flat maps having
          North at the top, locations plotted by latitude and longitude, and distances measured in
          miles, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>must have found the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>map bewildering. Both
          Indians and whites made maps, but the interests of those peoples and their cartographic
          conventions were quite different. Indian mapmakers often oriented their maps along
          sunrise and sunset lines or toward the direction of travel. Distances were measured in
          terms of travel time while directions were expressed in words such as above and below.
          Because Indians mapped what was important to them, the concerns of the expedition must
          have sometimes appeared strange or illogical. Used to travel overland by horse, plains
          people found it difficult to answer questions about the heads of navigation on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and other rivers. Lines drawn in
          the sand might mean creeks, game trails, or often-used war routes. Language itself
          compounded the problem. Simple prepositions such as 
          <hi rend="italic">to</hi>and 
          <hi rend="italic">from</hi>could be crucial in explaining the direction of a river's
          flow. The shape of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>map, its unfamiliar
          conventions, and the cultural assumptions behind it must have challenged 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>abilities. That the explorer and
          the Indian were willing to attempt such communication across an especially treacherous
          cultural divide testifies to the skill and persistence of both men.

               <p>It was easier for 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to fix tribes and villages on his
          own western map than to interpret native charts. In many ways 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>1805 map was a visual statement
          of the "Estimate of the Eastern Indians." The peoples classified and tabulated in the

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>could rely on the expedition's

          <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>, the explorer admitted that "the
          subsequent description of this river [the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>], and its subsidiary streams are
          taken altogether from Indian information." Convinced that such information was "entitled
          to some confidence," 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>nonetheless was careful to
          explain that he and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had closely questioned natives
          during the entire winter, compared their answers, and accepted only those that could be
          cross-checked. What came from mostly 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>sources was a remarkably
          accurate picture of the

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>analysis. Nowhere was that
          distortion more evident than in the ways explorers and Indians understood the nature of

          experience carrying heavy boats and cumbersome luggage around the falls, they reported
          that the portage was "not greater than half a mile." As it turned out, the expedition

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>ethnographic contributions, three
          related questions ought to be posed. First, what did the explorers see, understand, and
          accurately record? Determined to study the externals of Indian culture, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>excelled at describing village
          locations, weapons, food, clothing and other material aspects. Journal accounts of
          village meals illustrate the point. With obvious relish, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>described 
          <name type="person" key="Little Crow (Ka-goh-ha-me)">Little Crow's</name>wife stirring
          "a kettle of boiled Cimnins, beans, corn and choke cherries with the stones." 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>went further, describing with
          cookbook accuracy the ingredients and shaping of Indian corn ball bread. The sergeant
          found that this part of the Indian diet "eats verry well."
          <ref target="n0537" n="37"/>With a common-sense curiosity that characterized so much of
          the expedition's ethnography, the explorers observed and tasted the stuff of Indian
          life.</p>
               <p>On occasion, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were able to understand and record
          other aspects of Indian life, including trade, a subject of intense interest to them.
          Although sometimes confused by Indian notions of what was valuable in an economic
          exchange, the explorers did comprehend one of the central rituals in intertribal trade.
          Because Indians who traded at the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>villages were for most of
          the year potential enemies, or relatives of those killed in combat, means had to be
          found to forestall possible violence and allow peaceful relations. Reflecting the
          fundamental Indian social reality that defined relatives as friends and outsiders as
          enemies, villagers and nomads created a ceremony in which strangers were made temporary,
          fictional relatives. Men who might later fight each other could for a brief time
          exchange goods, trade stories, and even share religious practices as fathers and sons.

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>took note of "a serimony of
          adoption, and interchange of property." Relating the process to 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>explained that "every man of the

          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>or 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Ricara</name>with whom he had to deal."
          An exchange of gifts sealed the adoption, established certain bargaining limits, and
          signaled the opening of peaceful trade.
          <ref target="n0539" n="39"/>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a second question equally worth asking. What did the expedition see,
          record, but not understand? During that long 
          <name type="place" key="North Dakota">Dakota</name>winter the explorers encountered many
          things well beyond their own cultural experience. Ritual behavior or social customs
          often eluded their grasp, especially if they had no counterparts in white American life.
          Berdaches, those plains Indian men who dressed and acted as women, caught the captains'
          attention but evaded their understanding. First mentioned by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>in late December 1804, the
          berdaches were described as "men dressed in squars clothes." In conversation with 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>amplified that original
          description, adding that young 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>boys showing "any
          symptoms of effeminacy or girlish inclinations" were raised as women, married men, and
          fulfilled all the functions assigned to 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>women. But 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had missed the spiritual nature of
          the berdache while imposing an interpretation of sexual deviation where none belonged.
          What he perceived as gender confusion or homosexuality was actually something quite
          outside his own experience. Men became berdaches not early in life but usually as
          teenagers or later. The berdache role could be assumed only after a series of dreams
          from the Holy Woman Above. Only brothers or sons of men owning ceremonial rights to the
          Woman Above and Holy Woman bundles could become berdaches. After having the required
          dreams and assuming women's clothing, berdaches were viewed as persons of great and
          sometimes mysterious spirit power.
          <ref target="n0540" n="40"/>
               </p>
               <p>The explorers were equally confused by the few native religious rituals they
          witnessed. One of those was the practice of feeding to buffalo heads or skulls a
          ceremonial meal. When 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>saw a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>offer food to a buffalo
          head, he ridiculed the devotion, saying, "Their superstitious credulity is so great,
          that they will believe by using the head well the living buffalo will come and that they
          will get a supply of meat." After the expedition's hunters killed a buffalo and put its
          head on the bow of the keelboat, an Indian passing by stopped and spent some time
          smoking to the buffalo. Asked what he was doing, the man replied that the buffalo was
          his medicine and required this ritual.
          <ref target="n0541" n="41"/>
               </p>
               <p>Although the ceremony was accurately described by 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, its meaning escaped them. The
          Americans did not sense the connection Indians made between living things and those
          apparently dead. Feeding buffalo heads could appease the spirits of dead animals while
          reassuring those that were to be hunted and killed. Hunters always made a small offering
          to a skull before beginning the hunt. Buffalo skulls were often included in the most
          powerful of the medicine bundles. Unaware of the sanction given to buffalo feeding by
          the buffalo culture hero in the Sacred Arrows myth, the explorers could interpret the
          practice as only savage superstition or childish fantasy.
          <ref target="n0542" n="42"/>
               </p>
               <p>One of the rituals of village life most carefully recorded and least understood was
          the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>buffalo-calling ceremony.
          The open sexuality of the rite certainly attracted some of the American party, but the
          purpose of that ritual intercourse simply baffled 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Several men in the expedition
          obligingly took part in it, and their experiences enabled 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to write a remarkably detailed
          description of buffalo calling. He realized that the ceremony was undertaken to attract
          the herd and guarantee a successful hunt. But he simply could not fathom how sexual
          relations between old men or white men and the wives of younger Indians could bring the
          animals closer and ensure good kills. Admiring much about the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>way, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>found it difficult to reconcile
          what seemed random promiscuity with his own positive evaluation of village life. He did
          not understand that northern plains cultures assumed that sexual intercourse was like a
          pipeline that could transfer spiritual power from one person to another. Old men had
          that special power and, as 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>himself noted, "the Indians say all
          white flesh is medisan." Giving their wives to old men or white strangers was a way
          aspiring young men could appropriate powerful spirit forces for themselves. Nothing in
          his cultural heritage prepared 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to comprehend all this, but he had
          the good sense to make an accurate record of the event. It is important to recall that 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was not prudish about buffalo
          calling. He wrote his account in plain English. It was only later that the proper
          Philadelphian 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>put 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>forthright words into genteel
          Latin.
          <ref target="n0543" n="43"/>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>ethnography needs to be assessed
          by what the explorers did not see. Since it was the wrong season of the year, they did
          not witness the awesome Okipa. Because many essential social aspects of native life were
          culturally invisible to most white outsiders, the captains did not take note of the
          clans and age-grade societies that gave shape to Upper 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>Indian life. Some objects were
          hidden from all strangers: 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>neither saw nor wrote about the
          sacred bundles, the turtle drums, and the ceremonies that surrounded those objects. Just
          how much Indian religious practice the explorers understood is not clear from the
          evidence. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did write about "medicine" and
          tried to explain the idea to 
          <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>by recounting part of a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>creation story.
          <ref target="n0544" n="44"/>But it is doubtful if any member of the expedition
          understood the plains belief in power or medicine as a tangible force that pervaded all
          life. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and

          beyond the explorers' cultural horizon.</p>
