          cleared up, and was cold all night. This morning was clear and cold, and all the
          mountains in sight were covered with snow, which fell yesterday and last night. At 8
          o'clock we started down the river, and in the course of the day our hunters
          <ref target="n37071021" n="21"/>killed five deer, two elk and a bear. The road was very
          muddy after the rain. The country on both sides is composed of beautiful plains; the
          river about 80 yards wide and tolerably straight, with some cotton wood timber on its
          banks; and plenty of game of different kinds ranging through the plains. Having made 24
          miles we encamped
