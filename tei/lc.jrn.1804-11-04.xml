               <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Toussaint Charbonneau</name>is, of
        course, one of the best-known members of the Corps of Discovery, thanks to his association
        with 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>. He was a French Canadian, born about
        1758, who had worked for the North West Company and had apparently lived among the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>as an independent trader
        for several years by 1804. He appears, of course, in all accounts of the expedition and in
        the various biographies of 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, but relatively little has been
        written on the man himself. Estimates of his character have generally been unfavorable,
        many historians portraying him as a coward, a bungler, and a wife-beater. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>described him as "A man of no
        peculiar merit" who "was useful as an interpreter only"; nonethless, his services in that
        capacity, together with his wife's, were virtually indispensable, to say nothing of his
        considerable ability as a cook. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>evidently had a higher opinion of 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>, for he saw to the
        education of the couple's son, offered to set 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>up as a farmer or
        trader, and saw to it that his old associate had employment in the fur trade and
        government service until his own (
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>) death. After the expedition 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>worked for 
        <name type="person" key="Lisa, Manuel">Manuel Lisa</name>in the Missouri Fur Company, then
        carried out diplomatic errands among the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>tribes for the United States
        during the War of 1812. He joined an expedition to 
        <name type="place" key="Santa Fe, N. Mex.">Santa Fe</name>in 1815, where the Spanish
        briefly imprisoned him, and worked as an interpreter for

        <name type="person" key="Wurttemburg, Paul, Prince of">Prince Paul of Wurttemburg</name>,
        and 
        <name type="person" key="Maximilian, Alexander Philip">Prince Maximilian</name>, in
        addition to serving various fur-trading firms. During 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>long tenure as superintendent of
        Indian affairs in the trans-
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>West, 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>was on the government

        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>interpreter. He was
        discharged in 1839, about a year after 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>death, and thereafter disappears
        from the record; evidently he was dead by 1843. A probable likeness of him is found in
        Karl Bodmer painting "The Travelers Meeting with 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minataree Indians</name>near Fort Clark,"
        which shows someone, perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>, interpreting for 
        <name type="person" key="Maximilian, Alexander Philip">Maximilian</name>in 1833–34, when

        of words written about her, most of what we know about her life and personality is to be
        found in the expedition journals and a few other papers of

        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>, probably in 1804.
        Many writers have referred to her as the guide of the expedition, but 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>hired her and 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>as interpreters. Her
        services in that capacity among the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshonean</name>-speaking people in the
        
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</name>were indispensable, while her
        presence with a baby calmed the fears of many tribes that the party was a war expedition.
        She did provide valuable assistance as a guide in the region of southwestern 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>in which she had spent her childhood. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>seems to have had a high opinion of
        her, as he did of 
        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>and the couple's son,
        but romantic fantasies concerning the two have no foundation in the record. There is some
        controversy about whether the name by which we know her was 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>or 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>, and the appropriate
        spelling and pronunciation remain in doubt. All of the captains' attempts to render the
        name indicate a hard "g" sound in the third syllable. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>understood the name to mean "
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Bird Woman</name>." (See below, 
        <ref n="1805-05-20" type="related">May 20, 1805</ref>.) On her subsequent life there is
        also little information. The best evidence is that she died at

        <name type="place" key="Fort Manuel (S. Dak.)">Fort Manuel</name>, on the

        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>recorded her as having died by
        1825–28. Assertions that she lived to be nearly one hundred, dying in 1884 on the
