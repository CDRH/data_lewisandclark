               <p>I arrose early this morning and made a drawing of the falls.
          <ref target="n37071701" n="1"/>   after which we took breakfast and departed.
             it being my design to strike 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>about the place at which I
          left it on my return to it's mouth in the begining of June 1805. I steered my course
          through the wide and level plains which have somewhat the appearance of an ocean,
          <ref target="n37071702" n="2"/>not a tree nor a shrub to be seen.    the land
          is not fertile, at least far less so, than the 
          <name type="place" key="Great Columbian Plain">plains of the Columbia</name>or those
          lower down this river, it is a light coloured soil intermixed with a considerable
          proportion of coarse gravel without sand, when dry it cracks and appears thursty and is
          very hard, in it's wet state, it is as soft and slipry as so much soft soap.
          <ref target="n37071703" n="3"/>   the grass is naturally but short and at
          present has been rendered much more so by the graizing of the buffaloe, the whole face
          of the country as far as the eye can reach looks like a well shaved bowlinggreen, in
          which immence and numerous herds of buffaloe were seen feeding attended by their
          scarcely less numerous sheepherds the wolves.    we saw a number of goats as
          usual today, also the party coloured plover with the brick red head and neck;
          <ref target="n37071704" n="4"/>this bird remains about the little ponds which are
          distributed over the face of these plains
          <ref target="n37071705" n="5"/>and here raise their young.    we killed a
          buffaloe cow as we passed throug the plains and took the hump and tonge which furnish
          ample rations for four men one day.    at 5 P. M. we arrived at 
          <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">
                     <hi rend="italic">rose</hi>[
          <hi rend="italic">NB?: Tansy</hi>] river</name>
                  <ref target="n37071706" n="6"/>where I purposed remaining all night as I could not
          reach 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">maria's river</name>this evening and unless I did
          there would be but little probability of our finding any wood and very probably no water
          either. on our arrival at the river we saw where a wounded and bleading buffaloe had
          just passed and concluded it was probable that the indians had been runing them and were
          near at hand.    the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Atsina Indians">Minnetares of Fort de prarie</name>and
          the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">blackfoot indians</name>rove through
          this quarter of the country and as they are a vicious lawless and reather an abandoned
          set of wretches I wish to avoid an interview with them if possible.
          <ref target="n37071707" n="7"/>I have no doubt but they would steel our horses if they
          have it in their power and finding us weak should they happen to be numerous wil most
          probably attempt to rob us of our arms and baggage; at all events I am determined to
          take every posible precaution to avoid them if possible. I hurried over the river to a
          thick wood and turned out the horses to graize; sent 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>to pursue and kill the
          wounded buffaloe in order to determine whether it had been woundded by the indians or
          not, and proceeded myself to reconnoitre the adjacent country having sent 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>for the same purpose a different
          rout. I ascended the river hills and by the help of my glass examined the plains but
          could make no discovery, in about an hour I returned to camp, where I met with the
          others who had been as unsuccessfull as myself. 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>could not find the wounded
          buffaloe. 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>whom I had left at camp had
          already roasted some of the buffaloe meat and we took dinner after which I sent 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>to resume their resurches for
          the indians; and set myself down to record the transactions of the day.

          water which is only about 3 feet deep occupys about 35 yds. and is very terbid of a
          white colour.    the general course of this river is from East to west so far
          as I can discover it's track through the plains, it's bottoms are wide and well timbered
          with cottonwood both the broad and narrow leafed speceis.    the bed of this
          stream is small gravel and mud; it's banks are low but never overflow, the hills are
          about 100 or 150 feet high; it possesses bluffs of earth like the lower part of the
