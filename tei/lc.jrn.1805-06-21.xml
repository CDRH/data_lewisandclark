               <p>This morning I employed the greater part of the men in transporting a part of the
          bagage over 
          <name type="place" key="Belt (Portage) Creek">portage creek</name>to the top of the high
          plain about three miles in advance on the portage. I also had one canoe carryed on truck
          wheles to the same place and put the baggage in it, in order to make an early start in
          the morning, as the rout of our portage is not yet entirely settled, and it would be
          inconvenient to remain in the open plain all night at a distance from water, which would
          probably be the case if we did not set out early as the latter part of the rout is
          destitute of water for about 8 miles—    having determined to go to the upper
          part of the portage tomorrow; in order to prepare my boat
          <ref target="n16062101" n="1"/>and receive and take care of the stores as they were
          transported, I caused the Iron frame of the boat and the necessary tools my private
          baggage and Instruments to be taken as a part of this load, also the baggage of 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John sheilds</name>, whom I had scelected to
          assist me in constructing the leather boat. Th[r]ee men were employed today in shaving
          the Elk skins which had ben collected for the boat.    the ballance of the
          party were employed in cuting the meat we had killed yesterday into thin fletches and
          drying it, and in bring in the ballance of what had been left over the river with three
          men last evening. I readily precei ve several difficulties in preparing the leather boat
          which are the want of convenient and proper timber; bark, skins, and above all that of
          pitch to pay her seams, a deficiency that I really know not how to surmount unless it be
          by means of tallow and pounded charcoal which mixture has answered a very good purpose
          on our wooden canoes heretofore. I have seen for the first time on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Missouri at these
          falls</name>, a species of fishing ducks
          <ref target="n16062102" n="2"/>with white wings, brown and white body and the head and
          part of the neck adjoining of a brick red, and the beak narrow; which I take to be the
          same common to 
          <name type="place" key="James (Jacque) River (S. Dak.)">James river</name>, the 
          <name type="place" key="Potomac River">Potomac</name>and

          numbers of buffaloe comeing to water at the river as usual.    the men who
          remained over the river last night killed several mule deer, and 
          <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>who was with me killed a
          young Elk. The wind blew violently all day. The growth of the neighbourhood what little
          there is consists of the broad and narrow leafed cottonwood, box alder, the large or
          sweet willow, the narrow and broad leafed willow.
          <ref target="n16062103" n="3"/>   the sweet willow has not been common to the

          undergrowth consists of rosebushes, goosberry and current bushes, honeysuckle small, and
          the red wood, the inner bark of which the engages are fond of smoking mixed with
          tobacco.—</p>
