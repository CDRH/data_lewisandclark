          I saw a great number of feathers floating down the river    those feathers had
          a very extraordinary appearance as they appeared in such quantities as to cover pretty
          generally sixty or seventy yards of the breadth of the river.    for three
          miles after I saw those feathers continuing to run in that manner, we did not percieve
          from whence they came, at length we were surprised by the appearance of a flock of
          Pillican [
          <hi rend="italic">EC: Pelecanus erythrorhynchus</hi>] at rest on a large sand bar
          attatched to a small Island the number of which would if estimated appear almost in

          procuring their ordinary food; 
          <hi rend="italic">which is fish,</hi>on our approach they flew and left behind them
          several small fish of about eight inches in length, none of which I had seen before—
             the Pellican rested again on a sand bar above the Island which we called
          after them from the number we saw on it.    we now approached them within
          about three hundred yards before they 〈attemted to fly〉 flew; I then fired at random
          among the flock with my rifle and brought one down; the discription of this bird is as

          raising their young—    this duty seems now to have been accomplished from the
          appearance of a young Pilacon which was killed by one of our men [Dame] this morning,
          and they are now in large flocks on their return to their winter quarters.   
          they lay usually two eggs only and chuise for a nest a couple of logs of drift wood near
          the water's edge and with out any other preperation but the thraught [throat] formed by
          the proximity of those two logs which form a trough    they set and hatch
          their young which after nurture with fish their common food</p>

               </p>
               <p>The beak is a whiteish yellow the under part connected to a bladder like pouch, this
          pounch is connected to both sides of the lower beak and extends down on the under side
          of the neck and terminates in the stomach—    this pouch is uncovered with
          feathers, and is formed [of] two skins the one on the inner and the other on the center
          side    a small quantity of flesh and strings of which the anamal has at
          pleasure the power of moving or drawing in such manner as to contract it at pleasure.
             in the present subject I measured this pouch and found it's contents 5
          gallons of water—</p>
               <p>The feet are webbed large and of a yellow colour, it has four toes    the
          hinder toe is longer than in most aquatic fouls, the nails are black, not sharp and ½ an
          inch in length</p>
               <p>The plumage generally is white, the feathers are thin compared with the swan goose or
          most aquatick fouls and has but little or no down on the body.    the upper
          part of the head is covered with black f[e]athe[r]s short, as far as the back part of
          the head—    the yellow skin unfeathered extends back from the upper beak and
          opening of the mouth and comes to a point just behind the eye</p>
               <p>The large f[e]athers of the wings are of a deep black colour—    the 1st
          &amp; 2nd joint of [the wings] from the body above the same is covered with a second
          layer of white feathers which extend quite half the length of those large feathers of
          the wing—    the thye is covered with feathers within a quarter of an inch of
          the knee.</p>
