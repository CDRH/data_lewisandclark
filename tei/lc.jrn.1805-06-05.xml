               <p>This morning was cloudy and so could that I was obleged to have recourse to a blanket
          coat in order to keep myself comfortable altho' walking.    the rain continued
          during the greater part of last night.    the wind hard from N. W.
             we set out at sunrise and proceded up the river eight miles on the course
          last taken yesterday evening, at the extremity of which a large creek falls in on the
          Stard. 25 yards. wide at it's entrance, some timber but no water, notwithstanding the
          rain; it's course upwards is N. E. it is astonishing what a quantity of water it takes
          to saturate the soil of this country, the earth of the plains are now opened in large
          crivices in many places and yet looks like a rich loam from the entrance of this 
          <ref target="n14060501" n="1">Creek (which I called 
          <name type="place" key="Black Coulee (Lark Creek)">Lark C.</name>)</ref>the river boar
          N. 50. W. 4 m.    at the entrance of this creek the bluffs were very steep and
          approached the river so near on the Stard. side that we assended the hills and passed
          through the plains; at the extremity of this course we returned to the river which then
          boar North 2 mes. from the same point, I discovered a lofty single mountain which
          appeard to be at a great distance, perhaps 80 or more miles    it boar N. 52
          W.    from it's conic figure I called it 
          <ref target="n14060502" n="2">
                     <name type="place" key="Tower Mountain">tower Mountain</name>.</ref>   we now
          passed through the river bottoms to the extremity of the last course thence with the
          river S 60° W 1½ m. S 10 W. 3 m N 50 W 1½ at the extremity of which I again ascended the
          bluffs and took a course to a point of the Lard. bluffs of the river which boar West 10
          m. the river making a deep bend to the south that is of at least five miles from the
          center of the chord line to the center of the bend.    on this course we
          passed through the plains found the plains as yesterday extreemly leavel and beautifull,
          great quanties of Buffaloe, some wolves foxes and Antelopes seen.    near the
          river the plain is cut by deep ravines in this plain and from one to nine miles from the
          river or any water, we saw the 
          <ref target="n14060503" n="3">largest collection of the burrowing or barking squirrels
          that we had ever yet seen;</ref>we passed through a skirt of the territory of this
          community for about 7 miles. I [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: we</hi>] saw [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: near the hills</hi>] a flock of the 
          <ref target="n14060504" n="4">mountain cock,</ref>or a large species of heath hen with a
          long pointed tail which the Indians informed us were common to the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockey Mountains</name>, I sent 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>to kill one of them but he was
          obliged to fire a long distance at them and missed his aim.    as we had not
          killed or eat anything today we each killed a burrowing squrrel as we passed them in
          order to make shure of our suppers.    we again [in]tersepted the river at the
          expiration of the last course or the lard. bluffs, from whence it now boar N 80° W.
             2 mes. from this point saw some 
          <ref target="n14060505" n="5">other lofty mountains to the N. W. of 
          <name type="place" key="Tower Mountain">Tower Mtn.</name>which boar N. 65° W. 80 or 100
          mes. distant</ref>   at the expiration of this course we killed five Elk and a
          blacktailed or mule deer and 
          <ref target="n14060506" n="6">encamped on Stard. side of the river in a handsome well
          timbered bottom</ref>where there were several old stick lodges. in the forepart of the
          day there was but little timber in the river bottoms but the quantity is now greater
          than usual.    the river is about 80 yds. wide with a strong steady courant
          and from 6 to 10 feet water. I had the burrowing squirrels roasted by way of experiment
          and found the flesh well flavored and tender; some of them were very fat.</p>

          night, and the morning was cloudy. When preparing to set out we discovered three bears
          coming up the river towards us; we therefore halted a while and killed the whole of
          them. About 7 we set out along the plains again, and discovered the mountain South of us
          covered with snow, that had fallen last night. When we had gone about 11 miles we saw a
          large mountain
          <ref target="n14060510" n="10"/>to the West of us also covered with snow. This mountain
          appeared to run from North to South, and to be very high. The bearing of the river is
          still South West. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>thought this a good course
          for us to proceed on our voyage, and we turned back towards the camp again. We went
          about 15 miles and struck the small river
          <ref target="n14060511" n="11"/>about 20 miles from its mouth. Here we killed some elk
          and deer and encamped
          <ref target="n14060512" n="12"/>all night. There is a great deal of timber in the
          bottoms of this little river, and plenty of different kinds of game. In these bottoms I
