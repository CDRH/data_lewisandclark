         <p>In early June 1805, as they traveled up the Missouri toward the continental divide, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>and William 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>came to a fork where two rivers of
      apparently comparable width and force flowed together. The captains paused at this junction,
      unable to decide which river was the "main stream" of the Missouri and which was the
      tributary. They were determined to fulfill 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</name>'s instructions as
      exactly as possible: "to explore the Missouri river, &amp; such principal stream of it, as,
      by it's course and communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean . . . may offer the
      most direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0101" n="1"/>Punctilious to a fault, the captains interpreted this
      mandate narrowly: for them this order meant following the Missouri itself to its source,
      where a portage across the continental divide would lead to the Columbia watershed, a
      pattern that would mirror the upper Missouri and flow west to the sea. After nine days of
      reconnaissance, they decided that the river approaching them from the southwest should be
      declared the Missouri. 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>named the other river Marias, and
      called it one of the Missouri's "most interesting branc[h]es." 
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0102" n="2"/>
         </p>
         <p>The days of observation and definition at the Missouri/Marias confluence exemplify the
      survey work to which 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and contemporary European explorers
      were committed. All were field agents in a larger process of scientific classification by
      which "unknown" regions of the earth were mapped and described. But as 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>moved west across the North American
      continent, their contact with Native informants revealed spatial and topographical concepts
      at variance with their own. Native geographical knowledge was not simply sketchy,
      provisional information that scientific survey could confirm, correct, or supersede.</p>
         <p>HISTORY OF THE 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">LEWIS</name>AND 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">CLARK</name>EXPEDITION</p>
         <p>Historians of the 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition have been accepting and
      uncritical of the captains' mandate and what they achieved. In 1952 
      <name type="person" key="DeVoto, Bernard">Bernard DeVoto</name>praised expedition members as
      heroes because "they had filled out the map" and had pursued "scientific objectives" during
      two years of hardships, dangers, and adventures. Specifically, 
      <name type="person" key="DeVoto, Bernard">DeVoto</name>called the Missouri/Marias decision
      "a remarkable act of the mind [that] must be conceded a distinguished place in the history
      of thought. It is the basic method of science."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0103" n="3"/>More than twenty years later, 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">John Logan Allen</name>contrasted 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>field surveys with earlier
      geographical "lore" gleaned from speculative cartography and "sketchy native data." In 
      <hi rend="italic">Passage Through the Garden</hi>, published in 1975, 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>considers the expedition leaders to
      have been "a pair of trained and intelligent observers [who] gathered and analyzed
      geographical information in what can only be described as a scientific method." 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>echoes 
      <name type="person" key="DeVoto, Bernard">De Voto</name>in calling the decision at the
      Marias "a brilliant piece of deduction from a fuzzy set of facts [that] illustrates . . .
      the competence and intelligence of its commanders."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0104" n="4"/>In a complementary work published within a few years
      of 
      <hi rend="italic">Passage Through the Garden</hi>, 
      <name type="person" key="Cutright, Paul Russell">Paul Russell Cutright</name>established 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>as "pioneering naturalists" who charted
      flora and fauna according to Linnaean categories.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0105" n="5"/>Although 
      <name type="person" key="Ronda, James P.">James P. Ronda</name>'s studies of the
      expedition's contact with Native groups have tempered earlier interpretations of the
      captains' success, 
      <name type="person" key="Ronda, James P.">Ronda</name>continues to see the expedition as a
      scientific breakthrough and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>as mastering not only European
      cartographic skills but those of Native mapping.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0106" n="6"/>
            <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Gary E. Moulton</name>'s recent re-edition of the
      expedition's journals and maps praises the captains' science and specifically endorses 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>'s account of the decision at the
      Marias.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0107" n="7"/>
         </p>
         <p>Without exception, the captains' reasoning at the Missouri/Marias junction has been
      admired as characteristic of the expedition's scientific achievement.</p>
         <p>The expedition's mapping procedures are of particular interest in understanding the
      problem facing 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>at the Missouri/Marias junction. These
      procedures are described and judged within a geographical context clearly outlined in 
      <hi rend="italic">Passage Through the Garden</hi>. 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>suggests a progressive shift from
      the hearsay of Natives and traders, to speculative mapping, and finally to scientific
      geography:</p>
         <p>There are really three ways of knowing about areas geographically: a system of coherent
      knowledge based on accurate data and long acquaintance, a system of more or less coherent
      knowledge based on simple logical and theoretical constructions, or a system which is
      largely incoherent and based on desires, ambitions, long-standing myths and traditions, or
      pure rumor and fantasy. . . . The captains [
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>] would replace conjecture and
      speculation, wild reasonings of theoretical and logical frameworks, with scientific
      observation. They would fill in many blank spaces on the maps of the Northwest with facts
      recorded and verified rather than guessed at or hoped for.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0108" n="8"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>'s progression, rather confusingly
      presented in reverse order, is to be understood as three levels of geographical knowledge
      ranging from the least reliable ("desires, ambitions ... myths and traditions, . . . rumor
      and fantasy") to logical deduction ("more or less coherent . . . theoretical constructions")
      to field survey ("accurate data and long acquaintance ... scientific observation"). The
      captains' job was to replace the first two levels, inherited from Native "lore" and earlier
      maps, with the third. This process of discovery separated 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>from "lesser men and less capable
      explorers." As the captains ventured beyond the lower Missouri, "from an area . . . actually
      well known into one ... less known (in a real or empirical sense)," they found themselves in
      the frontier region of speculative cartography, faced with inadequate "data" and obliged to
      replace this reported knowledge with their own observations.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0109" n="9"/>The three-step progression can be reduced to "two
      kinds of geographical knowledge":</p>
         <p>The first is "real knowledge," or actual information obtained through active commercial,
      diplomatic, military, or scholarly enterprises or from the accounts of travelers and
      observers, evaluated in the light of what is presently accepted as geographical reality. The
      second and more important kind of knowledge is "perceived knowledge," or lore which is
      evaluated on the basis of accuracy as it is understood by the explorers themselves.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0110" n="10"/>
         </p>
         <p>"Real knowledge" was gathered from official European and American sources; "perceived
      knowledge" was based on fur-trade and Native reports. "Real knowledge" was confirmed by 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during their expedition; "perceived
      knowledge," though "more important" to the explorers themselves, was replaced by the
      captains' "field operations." Thus the process of discovery is that by which "invented
      geography is perceived as real until proven unreal by exploration and observation."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0111" n="11"/>In defining the achievement of 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>maintains a distinction that has
      become a tradition in histories of the expedition. "What is presently accepted as
      geographical reality" quickly loses its tentative quality, and becomes simply "reality," as
      the expedition's "actual observations" are set against "myths ... traditions . . . rumor . .
      . conjecture and speculation." Specifically, 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>categorizes Native contributions to
      "geographical lore" as different in kind from the contribution of "capable explorers" such
      as 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.</p>
         <p>Like 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>, 
      <name type="person" key="Heckrotte, Warren">Warren Heckrotte</name>has studied the map
      sources of the expedition's geographical knowledge. 
      <name type="person" key="Heckrotte, Warren">Heckrotte</name>is more aware than 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>of the complexity of the map
      compilations consulted by 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, but, he too defines the captains'
      achievement at the Missouri/Marias junction as a triumph of science: "these critical few
      days in the expedition can stand as the mark where the conjectures of 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>were swept aside and replaced
      by accurate factual detail."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0112" n="12"/>Thus, although the expedition's enduring achievement
      was political, historians have followed 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s lead; to fellow Americans and
      foreign diplomats alike, the US president promoted the venture as a scientific
      investigation. Paraphrasing his instructions to 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>three years before, he announced to
      Congress in 1806 that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had "traced the Missouri nearly to it's
      source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean, ascertained with accuracy the geography
      of that interesting communication across our continent, [and] learnt the character of the
      country ..." 
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0113" n="13"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">LEWIS</name>AND 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">CLARK</name>AS SCIENTIFIC OBSERVERS</p>
         <p>As scientific observers, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were provided with instruments,
      manuals, blank tables, base maps, and questionnaires that determined objects worthy of note,
      the categories of their inscription, and the standards by which they would be evaluated. The
      captains' instruments were far from "crude and unreliable," as 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>maintains: 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were as well equipped as any
      contemporary surveyors working on the British Ordnance Survey or on 
      <name type="person" key="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon</name>'s map of Egypt.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0114" n="14"/>The scientific categories of their enquiry were
      inherited from the Royal Society in London, reinforced by 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s connections with the Académie
      des Sciences in Paris, and specifically suggested by members of the American Philosophical
      Society in Philadelphia. The overland expedition was vaguely imitative of the voyages of 
      <name type="person" key="Cook">Cook</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Vancouver">Vancouver</name>, but 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>saw a closer model for his
      project in the fur trade opportunist 
      <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Alexander Mackenzie</name>. The trader's
      record of his transcontinental crossing, published in 1801, was well received in scientific
      circles despite his ignorance of botany and his shaky surveying skills.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0115" n="15"/>Like 
      <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Mackenzie</name>'s venture, but in contrast
      to the British maritime voyages, the American expedition would not include trained
      scientists. Observations taken and specimens collected would be handed over to experts on
      the expedition's return. 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s acknowledgment that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was not "regularly educated" tends
      to be overlooked in most recent histories of the expedition, as it was by 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>himself. The president's former
      secretary assured a future reading public that he and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>could provide "accurate information" on
      the geography, mineralogy, botany, and zoology of the trans–Mississippi West—despite
      inconclusive astronomical observations, uncatalogued biological collections, and years of
      delay in publishing any account of the western "tour."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0116" n="16"/>
         </p>
         <p>Whatever the proven level of their accomplishment, both 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>aspired to scientific discovery and
      subscribed to the aims and biases of contemporary empirical investigation. 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s previous training and 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s crash course in surveying ensured
      that their maps would be based on route traverses confirmed by astronomical observations and
      would be drawn according to European cartographic convention. But as 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>filled in blanks of their tables and
      base maps, both leaders were constrained as much as empowered by the disciplines and
      concerns they were representing in the field. Even 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s landscape descriptions drew on a
      standardized vocabulary of the picturesque, and the expedition's scientific records were
      equally reflective of prescribed ways of seeing.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0117" n="17"/>
         </p>
         <p>The choice point at the Marias demonstrates the way in which 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>operated within a network of scientific
      investigation, analysis, and interpretation that dictated what routes they selected and what
      they observed. Only partial, provisional assimilation of Native mapping was possible or
      desirable; instead explorers of the western interior attempted to make foreign knowledge
      comply with their own aims and categories. When they asked leading questions, tried to copy
      Native relief maps onto the flat pages of their notebooks, and failed to record the dialogue
      and gestures that were integral aspects of this transmission of knowledge, they reduced
      indigenous maps to isolated, poorly grasped details to be inserted into their own
      geographical images. The price of such assimilation was destruction of the integrity, and on
      many occasions the sense, of Native maps. Indigenous cartography has to be understood as
      providing (for its Native users) a complete, efficient geographical notation, not merely
      crude sketches from which (in the view of non-Native users) essential features are missing
      or expressed in odd ways. Native mapping challenges us to regard scientific geography in
      relative terms—to admit that all geographies are "conceptual" rather than "actual," imposed
      on rather than inherent in the landforms they describe.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0118" n="18"/>The nine days of indecision at the Marias illustrate
      the conflict between the captains' loyalty to scientific mapping and their simultaneous
      recognition that their own base maps were confusing and misleading. The reason for confusion
      at this point is more specific than the discovery process of replacing "lore" with "actual
      observations" that 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>outlines. 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were trying to locate Native landmarks
      on a map that represented several earlier stages of assimilation of Native
      "information."</p>
         <p>When they set out from Fort Mandan in the spring of 1805, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>apparently took with them a copy of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Aaron Arrowsmith</name>'s 
      <hi rend="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries in the Interior Parts of North
      America . . . Additions to 1802</hi>. Although 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">Nicholas King</name>'s map of the West had been
      commissioned for the expedition in 1803, and although it shows, in 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>'s words, "enough differences . . .
      to suggest that 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s representation of the
      Northwest was not evaluated as the best available without some reservations," there is no
      record in the journals of 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>that they ever consulted 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>'s map in the field.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0119" n="19"/>The captains would appear to have chosen a faulty

      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>offers no explanation for this
      curious discrepancy. An answer might be found in the map's complex publication history, of
      which 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>seems unaware.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0120" n="20"/>
            <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>refers to two versions of the 
      <hi rend="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries</hi>: the original issue dated
      1795, and "a revision of the 1795 map . . . published in 1802," and provides illustrations
      for both in his book. Unfortunately, his illustration of the "1795 map" is not of the
      original first state but of its fourth state, dated 1796, watermarked 1798 and published no
      earlier than 1799. In any case, both of the 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>maps referred to in 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s pre-expeditionary
      correspondence are to be understood as the "Additions to 1802." One of these served as 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>'s base map; the other was purchased in
      June 1803 and is likely the 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>map that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>carried with him. What 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>does not explain is that the Map
      Exhibiting all the New Discoveries . . . Additions to 1802 exists in two versions, a first
      issue (the fifth state of the map), which came out early in 1802, and a second issue (the
      sixth state), which could not have appeared until the last weeks of 1802 or early in 1803. 
      <name type="person" key="Heckrotte, Warren">Heckrotte</name>argues conclusively that 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>used the first issue dated 1802 as his
      base map, less convincingly that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>carried another copy of the first issue
      with them.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0121" n="21"/>But the captains' reliance on 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>rather than 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>might be explained by the purchase, in
      June 1803, of a very recent update, easily recognized as such by 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, 
      <name type="person" key="Gallatin, Albert">Albert Gallatin</name>, and 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, all of whom had studied the first
      issue carefully—the purchase, in other words, of the second issue dated 1802 (the sixth
      state).</p>
         <p>Also indicative of the captains' prior knowledge of the upper Missouri is 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s own map drawn at Fort Mandan. During
      the winter of 1804–05, descriptions and maps furnished by traders and Native leaders had
      supplemented and in some instances modified the 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>/
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>picture. As 
      <name type="person" key="Godlewska, Anne">Anne Godlewska</name>points out in her study of
      the contemporary Napoleonic survey of Egypt, map compilations provided "information of
      varied nature and quality" in a single image; elements from manysources were selected,
      rationalized, and transformed to fit the purpose, projection, and conventional detail of the
      composite map under construction.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0122" n="22"/>
         </p>
         <p>As they headed west from the Great Bend, the captains reviewed the pattern of tributaries
      that the British cartographer had drawn to represent the upper Missouri and compared it once
      again with Native landmarks they had learned about at Fort Mandan. Prominent on 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s map drawn during the winter of
      1804–05 is the north branch of the Missouri and its tributary, copied from 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>and called by "the Indians . .
      . the River which scolds at all others." 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>visitors to the fort had also
      told them that farther upstream, close to the continental divide, they would pass a series
      of falls and come to a division of the Missouri into three tributary forks. Two cartographic
      conventions can be seen in uneasy alliance on the maps that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>consulted and produced. The European
      scientific convention, featuring precise location on an astronomical grid, is made up of
      what 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>calls "actual observations"; the
      Native convention is more or less assimilated into the scientific convention and appears as
      a swath of reported, unverified details bordering the blank space of the West.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0123" n="23"/>Hesitating at the Missouri/Marias junction,
      "examining [their] maps," the captains tried to rationalize imperfectly assimilated details
      from their Native informants with their scientifically authorized image of the western
      interior. The long pause at the Marias, maintains 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>, was due to "the failure of the
      Indians to mention the outliers of the Rockies or to tell them about the Marias River."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0124" n="24"/>Just as plausibly, it was due to the captains'
      failure to understand the cartographic image of the upper Missouri that 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>and 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>s had presented to them. At
      any rate, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>continued their efforts to rationalize
      Native and scientific geographies: they looked for Native landmarks above the Marias, and
      they tried to fit these into a topographical scheme inherited from European mapping.</p>
         <p>THE "TRUE GENUINE MISSOURI"</p>
         <p>We can pause here with 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, weighing their decision. The captains
      were convinced that the watershed portage they sought lay at or very near the source of the
      "true genuine Missouri." They had passed the south branch and the "River which scolds at all
      others," both of which their informants at Fort Mandan had described; now they were looking
      out for the great falls.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0125" n="25"/>
            <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s route maps show the Marias as a
      smaller river flowing into the larger Missouri but widening considerably at its entrance
      into the main stream. The captains had not anticipated a river flowing from the northwest,
      muddy like the lower Missouri, swollen with runoff so that it was a considerable size: an
      unexpected river that cast doubt on the identity of the others they had already passed.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0126" n="26"/>Nonplussed, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>spread out their most authoritative
      reference, the one in which they invested the greatest faith: they consulted 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>.</p>
         <p>The 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>map seemed worthy of the
      captains' confidence because it showed the recent explorations of Peter 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>, a Hudson's Bay Company surveyor who
      had wintered with a 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Peigan Indians">Peigan</name>band along the front ranges of
      the Rockies in 1792–93 and who had supplied the British cartographer with information about
      the upper Missouri. 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were prepared to believe the findings
      of a fellow observer in the field; moreover, the second issue dated 1802 (if this is the one
      they carried) provided names for all of the Missouri's mountain tributaries. The two
      American leaders assumed that the Missouri as charted on 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s map was derived from 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s own surveys, but they could not
      identify the mysterious river from the northwest in 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s depiction of the watershed.
      When they were faced with the uncharted, unexpected river, they felt obliged to discount the
      
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>representation of the Missouri
      watershed and to doubt 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s "varacity."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0127" n="27"/>Instead they chose to believe Native accounts of the
      upper Missouri over 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s representation of 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s reports, and 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s discovery of the great falls on
      the ninth day of their investigation confirmed this choice. 
      <name type="person" key="Ronda, James P.">Ronda</name>points out that "despite
      misunderstandings about the identity of the Marias River, . . . the Indians' information
      proved not only accurate but invaluable." 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>, on the other hand, qualifies the
      advice offered by 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>s and 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>s as "sketchy native data,"
      concluding that "their [the captains] estimation of the accuracy of their [the Native
      informants'] data was excessive."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0128" n="28"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>themselves, and historians ever since,
      have considered the decision at the Marias as having a purely scientific importance: it was
      grounded in the logic of the "main stream" and the mountain portage of their instructions.
      Since the captains were following the Missouri to its source, since the Missouri was said to
      have its source in the Rocky Mountains, and since the southwest fork was without the
      turbidity that betrayed a long course through the prairies, therefore the river from the
      southwest was the Missouri and the other must be a tributary that might or might not
      originate as a mountain stream. 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>suggests that by this point in the
      journey 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were demonstrating "a growing ability .
      . . to differentiate between the geography as it had been imagined . . . and the geography
      as it actually was." 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>supports 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>'s interpretation: "the captains'
      keen geographic intuition led them to distinguish correctly between the Marias and Missouri
      rivers. More than a week's worth of investigation at the rivers' confluence proved the
      leaders correct."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0129" n="29"/>No change of method; ultimately no challenge to
      science. According to 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>, the captains were "correct"
      because they discerned the Missouri watershed pattern "as it actually was."</p>
         <p>CONVENTIONS OF REPRESENTING WATERSHEDS</p>
         <p>In preferring to emphasize field observation rather than the explorers' declared faith in
      Native directions,
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0130" n="30"/>
            <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>remain loyal to the empirical
      axioms that dictated the expedition's choices and evaluated its discoveries. But the
      captains did not simply progress from "conjecture and speculation" to proof by field
      observation. Instead they rejected the details of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s Missouri in favor of the
      details provided by their Native informants. At the same time, they continued to adhere to
      the pattern of the Missouri that 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>had suggested. As 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>himself admits of the expedition's
      geographical understanding generally, though not of its cartography, "the strength of a
      preconception .. . allowed [
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>] to diminish, in their assessments of
      the region, those features of the western environment which did not match the
      pre-exploratory image." The expedition leaders' preconceptions included not only the shapes
      and functions of geographical features, such as mountains and rivers, but also their
      cartographic notation. The captains did not perceive the Missouri watershed "as it actually
      was" but as it was scientifically represented on authoritative maps: they identified the
      stream they saw before them by matching it with the pattern of flow and drainage according
      to which river systems were imaged/imagined in European cartography. 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>summarizes the conception of the
      Missouri that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>arrived at during the winter at Fort
      Mandan:</p>
         <p>three major channels were understood as funneling the waters of the mountains into the
      Missouri system. The southern reaches of the farther West were drained by the Yellowstone
      ... The central portions of the region were tapped by the Missouri itself, the river
      described by the Indians as leading to the waters of the Columbia. And through the northern
      sections of the territory west of the 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>s ran the Milk River, the
      channel "through which, those small streams, on the E side of the Rocky mountains laid down
      by 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Mr. Fidler</name>, pass to the Missouri."</p>
         <p>
            <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>adds, "This was a crucial
      rearrangement of the alignment of the Missouri and its tributary streams . . . [a]
      refinement of earlier lore."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0132" n="32"/>But the "rearrangement" was simply a variation on the
      watershed theme. Science conceived of rivers in terms of watersheds, each river gathering
      volume from a number of smaller streams and flowing down to another river or the sea. Map
      signs were established on the basis of generally held geographical concepts such as those in
      
      <name type="person" key="Playfair, John">John Playfair</name>'s popular 
      <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth</hi>, published in
      1802. In describing rivers that "descend over the most rapid slope"—rivers that are "most
      subject to irregular or temporary increase and diminution"—
      <name type="person" key="Playfair, John">Playfair</name>reiterates the concept of a system
      that divides and subdivides in a proliferation of smaller and smaller streams. "When we
      trace up rivers and their branches toward their source, we come at last to rivulets, that
      run only in time of rain," he remarks, emphasizing the watershed or collection basin as the
      operating principle of this pattern. Even small rivulets, 
      <name type="person" key="Playfair, John">Playfair</name>argues (following 
      <name type="person" key="Hutton, James">James Hutton</name>'s geological theory), can carve
      deep valleys by the force of their sudden descent. 
      <name type="person" key="Playfair, John">Playfair</name>states "this great fact" in italics:
      "
      <hi rend="italic">rivers have, in general, hollowed out their valleys.</hi>"
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0133" n="33"/>This pattern of rivers and valleys was implicit in 
      <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s instructions to 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>:</p>
         <p>Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take 
      <hi rend="italic">careful</hi>observations of latitude and longitude, at all remarkable
      points on the river, &amp; especially at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands, &amp;
      other places ... The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri,
      &amp; of the water offering the best communication with the Pacific ocean, should also be
      fixed by observation.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0134" n="34"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>imposed this scientific sense of a
      watershed system on the Missouri and Columbia rivers they were sent to explore. 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s maps reflect his application of the
      river pattern of scientific cartography. 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>also relied on this scientific model
      in his "Summary view of the Rivers and Creeks" written at Fort Mandan during the winter of
      1804–05. The explorers' image of the upper Missouri is not, as 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>claims, remarkable for a shift in
      the kind of "data" it assembles or for failing to make "basic distinctions" between mountain
      streams and prairie rivers," so much as it is remarkable for the imposition of an unchanging
      river pattern inherited from European cartography onto rivers both observed and unexplored.
      All of the descriptions in the "Summary view" repeat the distinction between "main stream"
      and tributaries that is fundamental to the scientific river pattern. An example is the
      notice of the Cheyenne River, which the expedition had passed in October 1804,</p>
         <p>The Northern branch of this river penetrates the Black hills, and passes through a high
      broken well timbered country to it's source, the Southern fork takes it's rise in the Black
      hills, on their E side, and passes through a broken country covered with timber , . . . then
      entering an open fertile and level country it continues it's rout to the Missouri.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0136" n="36"/>
         </p>
         <p>As 
      <name type="person" key="Playfair, John">Playfair</name>does, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>traces a river from mouth to source
      and/or from source to mouth indiscriminately, but either way, the river is defined and named
      by its nature at the mouth. Toward the source, it proliferates into smaller streams; these
      small streams and any lower affluents are tributaries of the main river. Each of the
      tributaries "falls" or "discharges" or "disembogues" into this "main stream."</p>
         <p>
            <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s descriptions of rivers yet
      unexplored follow the same scientific model. During the winter at Fort Mandan, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>questioned resident 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>s and visiting 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>s to ascertain "the
      subsequent discription of [the Missouri], and it's subsidiary streams . . . their connection
      with each other, and their relative positions." Whatever the Native informants' responses, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>recorded their descriptions as
      further examples of the usual pattern. Thus the Yellowstone River, at its source a mountain
      stream, closely resembles the Cheyenne, a river of the plains:</p>
         <p>from it's source it takes it's course for many miles through broken ranges of the Rocky
      mountains . . . after leaving the Rocky mountains it descends into a country more level,
      tho' still broken, fertile and well timbered . . . the river [then] enters an open level and
      fertile country through which it continues it's rout to the Missouri.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0137" n="37"/>
         </p>
         <p>For his description of the Yellowstone, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>combined his own observation of
      rivers entering the Missouri below Fort Mandan with application of the "logical and
      theoretical construction" of a river system advocated by contemporary science, and reliance
      on Native reports of the "Mee'-ah'-zah, or 
      <hi rend="italic">Yellowstone river</hi>" upstream from the fort. Similarly, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s description of the Milk River
      below the Marias owes its detail to 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>reports, but its design to
      careful perusal of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s map.</p>
         <p>... a river falls in on the N. side called by the Minetares

      <hi rend="italic">ru-shush-sher</hi>or the river which scolds at all others. this river they
      state to be of considerable size, and from it's position and the direction which they give
      it, we believe it to be the channel through which, those small streams, on the E side of the

      the successive states of the map: the first three issues had noted the extent of 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s survey in 1792–93, but this note,
      removed as of the fourth issue, "could leave a reader of the map with the impression that 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>had travelled as far south as Bear's
      Tooth, shown on later states as the source of the Missouri's south branch." 
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0139" n="39"/>
            <name type="person" key="Heckrotte, Warren">Heckrotte</name>is too generous: the 1802 states
      still clearly show 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s route to the Rocky Mountains in 1792
      and his return the following year. Nor was the pattern of the upper Missouri and its
      tributaries, marked by the dotted lines that conventionally signified conjecture, to be
      understood as anything more than a hypothetical connection of the mountain sources to the
      surveyed lower river. 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>had understood the hypothetical nature
      of this image; on his map, the dotted lines are reinforced by the indication "Conjectural,"
      in very large letters. Quite simply, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>misread the 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>map. What they found deceptive
      was the familiarity of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s Missouri—the "main stream,"
      the proliferating tributaries, the scientifically acceptable pattern of a river system. This
      pattern was so plausible that the captains ignored the indication of 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s route, overlooked the dotted lines,
      and doubted the surveyor's "varacity."

         <p>Apparently 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and

      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s own reliance on Native visitors. 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s information about the Missouri River
      was not first-hand; it was derived instead from Native geographical knowledge. There is some
      confusion among historians over the source and nature of this knowledge. During the winter
      of 1802, 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>solicited five maps from "
      <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfoot Indians">Blackfoot</name>" and "Fall Indian" (
      <name type="native_nation" key="Siksika Indians">Siksika</name>and

      on the South Saskatchewan River. 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s copies of these Native maps survive.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0141" n="41"/>Every commentator except

      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s image of the Missouri is
      based on the Native maps 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>had collected a few months before. 
      <name type="person" key="Heckrotte, Warren">Heckrotte</name>notes that as early as the
      fourth state, dated 1796 but probably issued in 1799, "new information on the geography
      south of 50° must have come from the Indians, through 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>, since there is no record of any
      explorations to these regions." Only the second issue dated 1802 (the sixth state) could
      have incorporated details from the five Native maps that 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>solicited. 
      <name type="person" key="Heckrotte, Warren">Heckrotte</name>remarks that the sixth state

         <p>In fact, transmission of

      knowledge to 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>extended over a period of
      several years. The Native maps drawn for

      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>copied them into his own journals, and

      stages of drawing another map of his route to the Rockies ten years earlier are noted in 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s journal entries for March 1802. In
      July of that year, he sent both maps with a covering letter to the Hudson's Bay Company's
      board of directors:</p>
         <p>The enclosed is a Map of my Journey from Buckingham House to the Rocky Mountain in the
      Years 1792 a 3; in Six sheets. There is also an extra Sheet and half annexed to the above,

            <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s "Maps &amp; Papers" arrived in

      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0144" n="44"/>
            <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>seems to have used 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s two maps, received some time between
      late October and mid-December 1802, for the second issue dated 1802 (the sixth state) of his
      
      <hi rend="italic">Map Exhibiting all the New Discoveries</hi>.</p>
         <p>In sending his two maps to 
      <name type="person" key="Lean, Alexander">Lean</name>in 1802, 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>was anxious to correct and supplement
      an earlier report on the sources of the Missouri that he claims to have sent to the HBC
      Committee seven years before.</p>
         <p>You will perceive some little difference betwixt this Map [drawn in 1802] and my former
      one; which I think I sent to your Honours in the Year 1795; but this [1802 map] is much the
      most compleat and exact of the two . . . I have put down the Rivers &amp; in the Indian
      Names, which is 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">black feet</name>&amp; have translated
      all that I was capable of into English in the Indian map.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0145" n="45"/>
         </p>
         <p>The first three states of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s map, dated 1795 and 1796,
      show 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s journey with the 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Peigan Indians">Peigan</name>band and do not extend the
      Rocky Mountains south of the farthest point of his survey.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0146" n="46"/>The fourth state extends the Rockies south to the
      Bear's Tooth and shows eight streams flowing east from the mountains. 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s 1802 letter seems to contrast the
      maps he sent to London at that time with the image of the Rockies shown on the first three
      states of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s map. These source streams
      reappeared on the fifth state, the first issue dated 1802, but now they were connected by
      dotted lines with the Missouri River at the 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages. The second issue
      dated 1802 omits the northernmost tributary, but the pattern of the watershed, together with
      the kind of Native information solicited and assimilated, remains the same. Thus the
      cartographic image of the Missouri that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>attributed to 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>was not based on the English trader's
      own survey, as the expedition leaders thought, nor, as historians have since claimed, was it
      based uniquely on the Native maps that 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>had solicited in 1801 and 1802.
      Moreover, the authorship of the conjectural watershed patterns is in doubt: possibly 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>drew the dotted lines, possibly 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>himself.</p>
         <p>By his own admission in his letter of July 1802, however, 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s copying of the Native maps had
      already begun the process of assimilation of Native "information" into the theoretical
      framework of aims, acceptable details, and conventional signs that defined European
      scientific cartography. The maps 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>solicited underwent three
      transformations: 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s transcription of the originals, 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s correlation, rationalization, and
      insertion of their images onto his own maps, and 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s incorporation of 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s image into his series of updates. By
      these accommodations, Native knowledge of the upper Missouri, however and whenever acquired,
      was transformed into a scientifically plausible river system inscribed on an authoritative
      European map. At the same time, 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s own copying and re–copying of the
      five maps he solicited in 1801–02 (as well as many others during his fur–trade career) may
      well indicatehis tacit recognition that Native mapmakers were drawing more than he could
      interpret and incorporate into his own cartographic image.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0147" n="47"/>The most he would acknowledge was that 
      <name type="person" key="Ackomokki">Ackomokki</name>'s map, forwarded with his own in
      1802,</p>
         <p>conveys much information where European documents fail, and on some occasions are of much
      use, especially as they shew that such &amp; such Rivers &amp; other remarkable places are,
      tho' they are utterly unacquainted with any proportion in drawing them.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0148" n="48"/>
         </p>
         <p>The ephemeral nature of the originals, like the maps made for 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>at Fort Mandan—"rough maps [drawn] in
      the dirt," and "rude drawings on animal skins or stick scratches in the dirt" according to 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>
            <ref target="nlc.belyea.0149" n="49"/>—points not to their insufficiency but to the way
      these maps were preserved and communicated. They were given graphic realization only in the
      context of specific situations, drawn from memory, accompanied by speech and gesture.
      Neither 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>nor 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>made more than a cursory note that such
      conversations had taken place; their copies of Native maps are uncommented visual
      transcripts of an exchange that must have been much richer.</p>
         <p>Of 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s copies of the maps drawn for him in
      1801 and 1802, 
      <name type="person" key="Ackomokki">Ackomokki</name>'s first map (forwarded to London), the
      undated "Fall Indian" map, and a plan of journeys drawn by 
      <name type="person" key="Kioocus">Kioocus</name>in 1802 share largely unmodified conventions
      of Native cartography.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0150" n="50"/>River routes are drawn as straight or gently curved
      (not wavy) lines that connect with the central line of the Missouri. The trellis pattern on
      these Native maps is unlike the scientific model described by 
      <name type="person" key="Playfair, John">Playfair</name>and visualized by European
      cartographers. All of the river lines are given equal importance; all connect with the bar
      of the Rockies without the diminishing proliferation that is characteristic of rivers on the
      
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="King, Nicholas">King</name>maps. This is because the lines on the
      Native maps depict not only water channels but the avenues or obstacles these rivers become
      for travelers moving east-west or north-south respectively. The even, firm lines indicate
      all the rivers as access roads into the mountains or fords along the front ranges; none of
      the rivers is privileged over the others. The central line of the Missouri River may
      indicate its importance as the subject of the maps in so far as they are responses to 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s request for knowledge about the
      Missouri.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0151" n="51"/>Scientific cartography intrudes even on 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s copies. The rivers of 
      <name type="person" key="Ackoweeak">Ackoweeak</name>'s map, though still in a trellis
      pattern, are drawn in the regularly undulating lines that were sometimes used for unknown
      coasts and rivers on European maps and that appear on 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s transcripts of Native maps.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0152" n="52"/>On both of 
      <name type="person" key="Ackomokki">Ackomokki</name>'s maps, the upper Saskatchewan assumes
      a tributary pattern, and 
      <name type="person" key="Ackomokki">Ackomokki</name>'s second image also shows tributaries
      of the Missouri.</p>
         <p>Like 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>, 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>requested and collected maps from
      Native leaders he consulted. And like 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s, 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s copies of Native maps are hybrids
      that initiate the process of reformulation and assimilation in which 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s published images also played
      shifting, repeatedly modified parts. An early example survives from the captains' outward
      journey, drawn by the 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>chief 
      <name type="person" key="Sheheke">Sheheke</name>in January 1805. The Native trellis pattern
      persists on 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s copy, but the explorer has
      transcribed each of these rivers as a regularly undulating line, a compromise between Native
      design and European convention that is repeated many times on his 1810 map. It is
      interesting to note, on the maps he requested west of the divide, the importance assumed by
      the 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>Fork river ("
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s River"), which was transferred to 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s composite maps drawn in late 1806
      and in 1810. The course of "Clark's River" arcs from the Rocky Mountains to its junction
      with the Columbia: one river is not immediately identifiable as the tributary of the other.
      The original of this strange arc can be found on a 
      <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>map drawn for 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>in May 1806.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0153" n="53"/>
         </p>
         <p>PRECONCEPTIONS AND WAYS OF SEEING</p>
         <p>But so insistent an intrusion as the arc of "Clark's River" remains exceptional in 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s cartography. Similarly, there were
      moments such as the pause at the Missouri/Marias junction when 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were driven to suspect the
      insufficiency of their own understanding, but such moments did not last. "Actual
      observations" were used to fill in blanks, not to revise conventional images. It is
      difficult to appreciate just how wide a gap there must have been between the Native people's
      way of seeing water- and landforms, and the explorers' insistence on their own standard
      geographical patterns. Like 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, like 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>, like 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>, we tend to assume that our
      perception of geographic patterns is a direct understanding of natural phenomena—that we are
      accurately seeing what is there. A hint of this bias comes from explorers' tendency to
      rename geographical features, and historians' acceptance of these names as the "real" ones. 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>identified the "River which scolds
      at all others" with the river he had named for its "peculiar whiteness"; according to 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>, this was "the Milk River of
      reality."
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0154" n="54"/>We need to remember that 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>came west laden with scientific
      baggage, the chief elements of which were not their instruments but their preconceptions:
      their "logical and theoretical constructions," to use 
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>'s phrase again. We have inherited
      this way of seeing, as demonstrated by our scientifically correct topographical maps and
      geographical information systems. But the Native cartographers that 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>engaged were under no constraint to
      depict the upper Missouri as a watershed. Instead their maps show the Missouri as a web of
      equal streams, a series of fords, a multiplicity of access routes to the mountains. The
      logic of the captains' choice at the Marias occasioned the expedition's long detour past the
      Missouri's great falls to its three forks, across Lemhi Pass, and north along the Bitterroot
      trail. Yet shorter, easier routes could have been found by following well-worn Native trails
      to the buffalo. The captains' reliance on scientific geography actually slowed their
      progress, and for good reason: although they had great faith in details of Native
      "information" gained at Fort Mandan, they were less curious about the patterns of Native
      geographical knowledge.</p>
         <p>A more "remarkable act of the mind" than that of 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>is left for us to accomplish: to
      realize that river shapes and "connection with other rivers" are not limited to the
      watershed pattern we unthinkingly accept. This is very hard to do, since our vocabulary of
      rivers (
      <hi rend="italic">source, branch, mainstream, affluent, tributary, watershed</hi>) reflects
      the hegemonic model of empirical science. We do not have appropriate words to describe or
      explain what is traced on the maps 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>solicited. But we can at least
      acknowledge that Native maps were not simply "rude drawings," as 
      <name type="person" key="Moulton, Gary E.">Moulton</name>calls them—sketchy, approximate,
      crude designs that European and American explorers felt obliged to revise, pulverize into
      "data" and insert into their own "correct" geography.
      <ref target="nlc.belyea.0155" n="55"/>The captains' dilemma at the Missouri/Marias junction
      was the dilemma of all exploration, and especially of frontier cartography: the coexistence
      of two cultural verities—that of the Native inhabitants, and the explorers' own. In the end,
      one kind of knowledge could not be integrated, rationalized, reduced to the other, despite
      the partial inclusion of details learned from Native informants on scientific maps that the
      explorers carried with them. 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>suspected 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s "varacity" when the periphery of 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s map became his own center of
      interest. The captains were intent on replacing both Native knowledge and "erroneous"
      constructions with their own "actual observations," according to the progression outlined by
      
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>. But as we have seen, their mapping
      simply continued the patchwork compilation that had produced the 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>1802 update and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s own Fort Mandan map. On his return 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>continued the same process of combining
      his own surveys with reports from Native informants and traders, selected and rationalized
      to conform with scientifically acceptable ideas and patterns. His great map of the West,
      drawn in 1810, was engraved by 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Samuel">Samuel Lewis</name>and published in 1814 with the 
      <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>/
      <name type="person" key="Allen, John Logan">Allen</name>text.

         <p>With 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>'s 1814 update, the process of
      scientific enquiry that had prompted the 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition came full circle. As he had 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>'s maps, 
      <name type="person" key="Arrowsmith, Aaron">Arrowsmith</name>gave 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s work the imprimatur of scientific
      authority and made it available for yet further correction in the field. In their journals 
      <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Fidler</name>, 
      <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, and 
      <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expressed a qualified awareness of and
      confidence in Native knowledge; on their maps, whatever the Native visitors to Fort Mandan
      had said about the Missouri upstream, whatever they had drawn, pointed to, and named was
      transformed out of recognition or rejected in favor of a "correct" scientific view. At best
      we can reconstruct this cultural frontier as a tentative, fragmented, one-sided account of
      the explorers' attempt to assimilate this knowledge into their own image of the West. The
      other voice of the dialogue is missing, and that absence is our loss.</p>

      opposite to the entrance of a very considerable river . . . An interesting question was now
      to be determined; which of these rivers was the Missouri . . . to mistake the stream at this
      period of the season . . . would not only loose us the whole of this season but . . . might
      defeat the expedition altogether. convinced we were that the utmost circumspection and
      caution was necessary in deciding on the stream to be taken. . . . The whole of my party to
      a man except myself were fully peswaided that this river [flowing from the northwest] was
      the Missouri . . . I determined to give it a name and . . . called it Maria's River . . . it
      is a noble river . . . one of the most interesting brances of the Missouri in a commercial
      point of view." In the following discussion, a few phrases from these entries are quoted
