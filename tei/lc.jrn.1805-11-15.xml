               <p>Rained all the last night at intervales of Sometimes of 2 hours, This morning it
          became Calm &amp; fair, I prepared to Set out at which time the wind sprung up from the
          S. E. and blew down the River &amp; in a fiew minits raised Such Swells and waves
          brakeing on the Rocks at the point as to render it unsafe to proceed. I went to the

          an oppertunity for us to dry Some of our bedding, &amp; examine our baggage, the greater

          experienced    Confined on a tempiest Coast wet, where I can neither get out
          to hunt, return to a better Situation, or proceed on:    in this Situation
          have we been for Six days past.—    fortunately the wind lay about 3 oClock
             we loaded I in great haste and Set out    passed the blustering

               <p>Rained all the last night, this morning it became Calm and fair, I preposed Setting
          out, and ordered the Canoes Repared and loaded; before we could load our canoes the wind
          Sudenly Sprung up from the S. E and blew with Such violence, that we could not proceed
          in Safty with the loading. I proceeded to the point in an empty Canoe, and found that
          the waves dashed against the rocks with Such violence that I thought it unsave to Set
          out with the loaded Canoes—    The Sun Shown untill 1 oClock P M which afford
          us time to Dry our bedding and examine the baggage which I found nearly all wet, Some of
          our pounded fish Spoiled in the wet; I examined the amunition and Caused all the arms to
          be put in order.</p>
               <p>About 3 oClock the wind luled, and the river became calm, 〈we〉 I had the canoes
          loaded in great haste and Set Out, from this dismal nitich where we have been confined
          for 6 days passed, without the possibility of proceeding on, returning to a better
          Situation, or get out to hunt, Scerce of Provisions, and torents of rain poreing on us
