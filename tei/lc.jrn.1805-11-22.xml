Some little rain all the last night with wind, before day the wind increased to a Storm from the S. S. E. and blew with violence throwing the water of the river with emence waves ut of its banks almost over whelming us with water, O! how horriable is the day—    This Storm Continued all day with equal violence accompanied with rain, Several Indians about us, nothing killed    the waves &amp; brakers flew over our Camp, one Canoe Split by the Tosing of those waves—    we are all Confined to our Camp and wet.    purchased some <hi rend="italic">Wapto</hi> roots for which was given, brass armbans &amp; rings of which the Squars were fond.    we find the Indians easy ruled and kept in order by a Stricter indifference towards them

a moderate rain all the last night with wind, a little before Day light the wind which was from the S S. E. blew with Such violence that we were almost overwhelmned with water blown from the river, this Storm did not Sease at day but blew with nearly equal violence throughout the whole day accompaned with rain. O! how horriable is the day    waves brakeing with great violence against the Shore throwing the Water into our Camp &amp;c. all wet and Confind to our Shelters, Several Indian men and women Crouding about the mens Shelters to day, we purchased a fiew wappato roots for which we gave armbans, &amp; rings to the old Squar, those roots are equal to the Irish potato, and is a tolerable Substitute for bread</p>
               <p>
The threat which I made to the men of this nation whome I first Saw, and an indifference towards them, is: I am fulley Convinced the Cause of their Conducting themselves with great propriety towards ourselves &amp; Party.

than common, and one of our canoes got among some logs, and was split. The rain and wind continued all day violent.
