          to return and continue the chase.    the Indians left us about 12 O'Clk. The
          root of the thistle,
          <ref target="n28012101" n="1"/>called by the natives 
          <hi rend="italic">shan-ne-táh-que</hi>is a perpendicular fusiform and possesses from two
          to four radicles; is from 9 to 15 Inces in length and about the size a mans thumb; the
          rhind somewhat rough and of a brown colour; the consistence when first taken from the
          earth is white and nearly as crisp as a carrot; when prepared for uce by the same
          process before discribed of the white bulb or 
          <hi rend="italic">pashshequo quawmash,</hi>it becomes black, and is more shugary than
          any fuit or root that I have met with in uce among the natives; the sweet is precisely
          that of the sugar in flavor; this root is sometimes eaten also when first taken from the
          ground without any preperation; but in this way is vastly inferior.    it
          delights most in a deep rich dry lome which has a good mixture of sand.    the
          stem of this plant is simple ascending celindric and hisped.    the root
          leaves yet possess their virdure and are about half grown of a plale green.   
          the cauline leaf as well as the stem of the last season are now dead, but in rispect to
          it's form &amp;c. it is simple, crenate, &amp; oblong, reather more obtuse at it's apex
          than at the base or insertion; it's margin armed with prickles while it's disks are
          hairy, it's insertion decurrent and position declining.    the flower is also
          dry and mutilad.    the pericarp seems much like that of the common thistle.
             it rises to the hight of from 3 to 4 feet.—</p>
