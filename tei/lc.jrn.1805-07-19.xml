               <p>The Musquetoes are very troublesome to us as usual.    this morning we set
          out early and proceeded on very well tho' the water appears to encrease in volocity as
          we advance.    the current has been strong all day and obstructed with some
          rapids, tho' these are but little broken by rocks and are perfectly safe.   
          the river deep and from 100 to 150 yds. wide. I walked along shore today and killed an
          Antelope.    whever we get a view of the lofty summits of the mountains the
          snow presents itself, altho' we are almost suffocated in this confined vally with heat.
             the pine cedar and balsum fir
          <ref target="n17071901" n="1"/>grow on the mountains in irregular assemleages or spots
          mostly high up on their sides and summits.    this evening we entered much the
          most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen.    these clifts rise from the
          waters edge on either side perpendicularly to the hight of [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: about</hi>] 1200 feet.    every object here wears a dark
          and gloomy aspect.    the tow[er]ing and projecting rocks in many places seem
          ready to tumble on us.    the river appears to have forced it's way through
          this immence body of solid rock for the distance of 5¾ miles and where it makes it's
          exit below has thrown on either side vast collumns of rocks mountains high.   
          the river appears to have woarn a passage just the width of it's channel or 150 yds.
             it is deep from side to side nor is ther in the 1st 3 miles of this
          distance a spot except one of a few yards in extent on which a man could rest the soal
          of his foot.    several fine springs burst out at the waters edge from the
          interstices of the rocks.    it happens fortunately that altho' the current is
          strong it is not so much so but what it may be overcome with the oars for there is hear
          no possibility of using either the cord or Setting pole.    it was late in the
          evening before I entered this place and was obliged to continue my rout untill sometime
          after dark before I found a place sufficiently large to encamp my small party; at length
          such an one occurred on the lard. side where we found plenty of lightwood
          <ref target="n17071902" n="2"/>and pichpine. this rock is a black grannite below and
          appears to be of a much lighter colour above and from the fragments I take it to be
          flint of a yelloish brown and 
          <ref target="n17071903" n="3">light creemcolourd yellow.—</ref>   from the
          singular appeaerance of this place I called it the 
          <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place" key="Gates of the Rocky Mountains">gates of the rocky
          mountains</name>.</hi>
                  <ref target="n17071904" n="4"/>   the mountains higher today than yesterday,
          saw some Bighorns and a few Antelopes also beaver and Otter; the latter are now very
          plenty one of the men killed one of them today with a setting pole.   
          musquetoes less troublesome than usual.    we had a thundershower today about
          1 P. M. which continued about an hour and was attended with som hail.    we
          have seen no buffaloe since we enterd the mounts.    this morning early 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>pursued his rout, saw early
          in the day the remains of several Indians camps formed of willow brush which appeared to
          have been inhabited some time this spring.    saw where the natives had pealed
          the bark off the pine trees about this same season.    this the indian woman
          with us informs that they do to obtain the sap and soft part of the wood [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: wood</hi>] and bark for food.    at 11 A. M. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>feell in with a gang of Elk of
          which he killed 2.    and not being able to obtain as much wood as would make
          a fire substituded the dung of the buffaloe and cooked a part of their meat on which
          they breakfasted and again pursueed their rout, which lay along an old indian road.
             this evening they passed a hansome valley watered by a large creek
          <ref target="n17071905" n="5"/>which extends itself with it's valley into the mountain
          to a considerable distance.    the latter part of the evening their rout lay
          over a hilly and mountanous country covered with the sharp fragments of flint which cut
          and bruised their feet excessively; nor wer the prickly pear of the leveler part of the
          rout much less painfull; they have now become so abundant in the open uplands that it is
          impossible to avoid them and their thorns are so keen and stif that they pearce a double
          thickness of dressed deers skin with ease. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>informed me that he extracted 17
          of these bryers from his feet this evening after he encamped by the light of the fire. I
          have guarded or reather fortifyed my feet against them by soaling my mockersons with the
          hide of the buffaloe in parchment.    he encamped on the river
          <ref target="n17071906" n="6"/>much fortiegud having passed two mountains in the course
          of the day and travelled about 30 miles.—</p>

          timber in the bottoms except some small willows. About 1 o'clock we had thunder,
          lightening and rain, which continued an hour or two, and then the weather became clear.
          This afternoon we passed parts of the mountains, that were very high, and mostly of
          solid rock of a light colour. The mountains are so close on the river on both sides that
          we scarcely could find room to encamp. We went 20 miles and encamped
