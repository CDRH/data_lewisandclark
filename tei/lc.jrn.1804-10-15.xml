                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 15th.</hi>   It rained all last night, and we set out
          early in a cloudy morning. At 7 we saw a hunting party of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Rickarees</name>, on their way down to
          the villages. They had 12 buffaloe-skin canoes or boats laden with meat and skins;
          besides some horses that were going down the bank by land. They gave us a part of their
          meat. The party consisted of men, women and children. At 8 we went on again; passed a
          fine bottom covered with cotton wood on the north side, and naked hills on the south.
          About 10, we saw another party of hunters, who asked us to eat and gave us some meat.
          One of these requested to speak with our young squaw,
          <ref target="n07101507" n="7"/>who for some time hid herself, but at last came out and
          spoke with him. She then went on shore and talked with him, and gave him a pair of
          ear-rings and drops for leave to come with us; and when the horn blew for all hands to
          come on board, she left them and came to the boat. We passed a creek on the south side,
          and encamped at dusk on the north; where there was a party of Indians about 30 in
          number. Our squaw remained with this party: they gave us some meat and appeared very
          glad to see us.</p>
