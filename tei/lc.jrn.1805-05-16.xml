               <p>The morning was fair and the day proved favorable to our operations; by 4 oClock in
          the evening our Instruments, Medicine, merchandize provision &amp;c, were perfectly
          dryed, repacked and put on board the perogue. the loss we sustained was not so great as
          we had at first apprehended; our medicine sustained the greatest injury, several
          articles of which were intirely spoiled, and many others considerably injured; the
          ballance of our losses consisted of some gardin seeds, a small quantity of gunpowder,
          and a few culinary articles which fell overboard and sunk, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">the Indian woman</name>to whom I ascribe equal
          fortitude and resolution, with any person onboard at the time of the accedent, caught
          and preserved most of the light articles which were washed overboard    all
          matters being now arranged for our departure we lost no time in seting out; proceeced on
          tolerably well about seven miles and encamped on the Stard. side.

          fired on a panther,
          <ref target="n13051602" n="2"/>a little below our encampment, and wounded it; they
          informed us that it was very large, had just killed a deer partly devoured it, and in
          the act of concealing the ballance as they discovered him.    we caught two
          Antelopes at our encampment in attempting to swim the river; these anamals are but lean
          as yet, and of course not very pleasant food. I walked on shore this evening and killed
          a buffaloe cow and calf, we found the calf most excellent veal.    the country
          on either side of the river is broken and hills much higher than usual, the bottoms now
          become narrow and the timber more scant; some scattering pine and cedar on the steep
          declivities of the hills.—    this morning a white bear toar
