            <p>The essential, definitive record of the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition is contained in the
        journals and observations of the two captains, "the writingest explorers of their time,"
        in the words of Donald Jackson.
        <ref target="n01" n="1"/>If no one else associated with the enterprise had written a word
        we would still have a marvelous narrative replete with geographic, zoological, botanical,
        and ethnographic information. In fact, however, at least four other members of the party
        did set down their own daily accounts. This edition brings them together with those of
        their commanders for the first time.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Thomas Jefferson</name>did not order
        the actual keeping of separate journals by anyone other than the captains. In his final
        instructions to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, however, he did suggest that
        "several copies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at leisure times,
        &amp; put into the care of the most trust-worthy of your attendants, to guard, by
        multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed."
        <ref target="n02" n="2"/>All this would seem to require is that some of the "attendants"
        copy the captains' journals verbatim. Apparently 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, at an early stage, decided to do
        something else. On May 26, 1804, less than two weeks out from 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River Dubois</name>, the captains noted that "The
        sergts . . . are directed each to keep a separate journal from day to day of all passing
        accurences, and such other observations on the country &amp;c. as shall appear to them
        worthy of notice.—"
        <ref target="n03" n="3"/>
            </p>
            <p>In his last communication to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in April 1805, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>wrote: "We have encouraged our men
        to keep journals, and seven of them do so, to whom in this respect we give every
        assistance in our power."
        <ref target="n04" n="4"/>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had a sense of history; in
        departing westward from the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages he compared his
        little fleet of pirogues and canoes to the vessels of 
        <name type="person" key="Cook, James">Captain Cook</name>.
        <ref target="n05" n="5"/>The significance of his enterprise warranted as complete a
        record as possible. It might be too much to ask any enlisted men to copy their officers'
        voluminous journals, but those so inclined could be encouraged to add their bit to the
        record.</p>
            <p>At least some of the men who went with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>seem to have shared that sense of
        history. They were volunteers, after all, and although some of them no doubt simply hoped
        to escape from irksome military discipline or to find good beaver streams, others
        evidently knew very well that this was the chance of a lifetime, that they were involved
        in something that would survive them, something greater than their individual
        contribution. The combination of that sense of history with a degree of literacy and
        considerable diligence made a few of them journal keepers.</p>
            <p>To appreciate the work of these men, let us remember the conditions under which they
        wrote. Most days of the voyage involved hard physical labor, working canoes upstream,
        loading and unloading bulky equipment, hunting and butchering, tanning leather, making
        moccasins, cooking, chopping and shaping wood, caring for horses and searching for strays,
        mounting guard, portaging around falls and rapids, all while exposed to every kind of
        weather and to the attacks of insects and grizzly bears, with the constant danger of
        physical injury from accidents. At the end of such a day, perhaps while others were
        dancing to 
        <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte's</name>fiddle, a journal
        keeper would have to write by the light of a campfire in notebooks somehow kept safe from
        the elements. According to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, seven of the thirty-odd men had
        the perseverance and the sense of destiny to try.</p>
            <p>They wrote under the same conditions as the captains, and like them wrote not only for
        themselves. It seems probable that they examined each other's journals, and perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>read them, too. We know that on July
        14, 1804, having lost his notes for the previous day, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had "to refur to the . . . Journals
        of Serjeants." The enlisted men's journals were intended as part of the record; they were
        public documents and we cannot expect any deep psychological revelations. No one recorded
        explicitly, for example, his opinion of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>or 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>or 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>.</p>
            <p>Literacy was the first requirement. It is probable that some of the men could not even
        write their own names. Historians have expressed considerable humor over 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>awkward grammar and his versatility
        as a speller, but he was little worse than many contemporaries who like him were men of
        affairs, government officials, and army officers. Comparison of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journal with those of the enlisted
        men should keep us from laughing too much at 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Nor should we be overly amused at
        the enlisted men, for none of their journals suggests stupidity or dullness. They tried to
        the best of their ability to record an extraordinary experience.</p>
            <p>Sergeants in the army had to be literate, since they kept records for their companies,
        and it is not too surprising that three of the four enlisted men's journals that we now
        have are those of sergeants. 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd</name>held that rank from the start
        of the trip, and 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>was promoted some three months
        out to fill the place of the deceased 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse</name>is the only private
        whose journal we now have. 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>spelling and grammar are, if
        anything, better than 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>. We cannot judge 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>performance for we do not have his
        original writing. 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>apparently struggled with
        writing, but there is rarely doubt about what they meant.</p>
            <p>We have four enlisted men's journals, in one form or another. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>indicated that seven men were
        keeping journals, and the discrepancy requires some notice, although few hard conclusions
        can be made. Since the other sergeants were expected to keep journals, one would assume
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergeant Nathaniel Pryor</name>would also
        do so, but no document demonstrating this has come to light. 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>served later on as an army
        officer and an Indian agent, but other men filled those posts on the frontier who could
        barely sign their names. On August 12, 1806, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>noted that 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>had left behind saddlebags
        containing his "papers," but 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>had just returned from being
        separated from the main party, and the papers could have consisted only of letters he was
        supposed to deliver to a Canadian trader, and perhaps a journal of his separate trip,
        which began barely three weeks before. In any case, 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>went back and recovered the
        saddlebags, so the papers, whatever they were, were not then lost. There is simply no
        clear evidence to show that 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>was one of the seven journal
        keepers mentioned by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>.</p>
            <p>It is fairly certain that one private besides 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>kept some sort of journal,
        because 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Robert Frazer</name>announced his intention to
        publish by issuing a prospectus soliciting subscribers barely a month after the party
        returned to 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, promising "An accurate
        description of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and its several branches; of the
        mountains separating the Eastern from the Western waters; of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>and the Bay it forms on the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>; of the face of the Country in
        general; of the several Tribes of Indians on the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>rivers . . . ," and with all this
        "a variety of Curious and interesting occurrences during a voyage of two years four months
        and nine days." The account, 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name>made clear, was "Published by
        Permission of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captn. Meriwether Lewis</name>."
        <ref target="n06" n="6"/>If the journal was anything like what 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name>promised, that it was never
        published is a great pity. Given the importance of the expedition this is surprising,
        especially since 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>was able to secure publication
        of his work the next year and since there were six further editions of his book in six
        years. Clearly it was not lack of public interest in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>discoveries that held 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer's</name>work back. Whatever the problem
        was, 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name>passed from view and so did his
        journal; we have no clue as to its fate.</p>
            <p>In April 1805, when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>wrote that seven men were keeping
        journals, 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>was already dead. If we accept 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name>as journal keepers, along with 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, and 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>, we still have two others
        to account for. It is possible that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>counted 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, whose journal was sent back from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, even though his record
        had ceased the previous August. There is a possibility that 
        <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Private Alexander Willard</name>kept a
        journal, and with 
        <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>we would have 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>seven journal keepers.
        <ref target="n07" n="7"/>One way or another a considerable part of the record appears to
        be lost, perhaps forever.</p>
            <p>The journals that remain belong with those of Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, supporting them to the best of
        their ability as they did during the voyage. After the return 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>evaluated his men, each according
        to his individual merits, and then wrote of them all: "the Ample support which they gave
        me under every difficulty; the manly firmness which they evinced on every necessary
        occasion; and the patience and fortitude with which they submitted to, and bore, the
        fatigues and painful sufferings incident to my late tour to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>, entitles them to my warmest
        approbation and thanks."

            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergeant Patrick Gass</name>, it seems clear, was
        a tough, lively, enterprising man who did things his own way. He was of Irish ancestry,
        but the comic brogue those writers of fiction give him is probably the product of their
        imaginations. 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>was born in 1771 in 
        <name type="place" key="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</name>. Like 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name>he was serving in 
        <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Captain Russell Bissell's</name>company of the
        First Infantry, stationed at 
        <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskia</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Illinois">Illinois</name>, having joined the army in 1799. Before
        then he had served on the frontier as a volunteer Ranger, a type of service requiring
        hardy and self-reliant men, and had become a competent carpenter, one of the most useful
        of frontier skills. Apparently he was one of those restless young Americans who moved
        about from one place to another and from one job to another, consciously looking for the
        right place and the right opportunity, unconsciously savoring the experiences life brought
        him. The Secretary of War instructed 
        <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Captain Bissell</name>to furnish 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>with "one Sergeant &amp; Eight good
        men," but 
        <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Bissell</name>evidently did not wish to lose a
        good carpenter, for he refused 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>request to be one of them. 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>was determined and sought out 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and presented his case himself. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>says nothing of this in his
        Eastern Journal, but he must have been pleased with the Irishman's initiative. On a later
        occasion that initiative would please him less.

            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>does not appear in the captains'
        journals until January 3, 1804, when he is listed in 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>field journal. It can be assumed

        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River Dubois</name>. Although he was in his thirties
        when he joined the Corps of Discovery and had served four years in the regular army, he
        was not among the original three sergeants. After 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd's</name>death in August 1804 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>held an election among the men to
        choose his successor, and 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>received the most votes. On August 26 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>noted, "apt. 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Pat Gass</name>a Sergt. Vice 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>Deceased." In a Detachment Order the
        captains told the men:</p>
            <p rend="blockquote">The Commanding officers have every reason to hope from the previous
        faithfull services of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name>, that this expression of their
        approbation will be still further confirmed, by his vigilent attention in future to his
        duties as a Sergeant. The Commanding officers are still further confirmed in the high
        opinion they had previously formed of the capacity, deligence and integrety of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name>, from the wish expressed by a
        large majority of his comrades for his appointment as Sergeant.</p>
            <p>Nothing in the captains' journals suggests that their confidence was misplaced.</p>
            <p>Since 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>furnishes us with the dimensions of 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>(the only journal keeper
        who does so), we can assume that his carpentry was important in its construction, and no
        doubt the same was true of 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>and of the many dugout
        canoes the party constructed at various places along the route. Like 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant Ordway</name>he appears in the record
        chiefly in executing some duty, and the captains make no complaint of him. Like 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>he had a job with a little
        more authority than the privates and many more demands on his time, energy, and judgment.
        When 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, in July 1806, made a side
        expedition up the 
        <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name>, the job of supervising the men
        left at the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the

        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, the only sergeant with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>accompanied 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>to 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>after the party's return, then

        <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio River</name>, southwest of 
        <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name>. He returned to the army to
        serve in the War of 1812 and lost an eye, in battle by his own account, in an accident
        while chopping wood according to army records. He returned to 
        <name type="place" key="Wellsburg, W. Va.">Wellsburg</name>and settled down, and at the
        age of sixty married a woman of twenty and made up for lost time by fathering six
        children. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, who tried to keep track of the
        expedition members, thought him dead by about 1825, but in fact he lived until 1870, when
        he was in his ninety-ninth year. The previous year the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>railroad had been completed and 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>, one of the first Americans to
        cross the continent and the last survivor of the Corps of Discovery, had lived to see it.
        <ref target="n10" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>The record gives us reason to believe that 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>was a man of some independence, capable
        of following orders, but sometimes making his own rules. The history of his journal
        confirms this impression. The original, unfortunately, is lost to us. 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>acknowledged that he "never learned to
        read, write, and cipher till he had come of age,"
        <ref target="n11" n="11"/>but he still thought his record was worthy of presenting to the
        world, and he asked no one's permission to do so. In March 1807 the 
        <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>published a prospectus for "a Journal of the Voyages &amp;
        Travels of a Corps of Discovery, under the command of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>of the Army of the United
        States, from the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">river Missouri</name>through the interior parts of
        North America to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>." It promised "An authentic
        relation of the most interesting transactions during the expedition;—a description of the
        country, and an account of its inhabitants, soil, climate, curiosities, &amp; vegetable
        and animal productions."
        <ref target="n12" n="12"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had apparently learned of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>intention a little earlier, and he
        was not pleased. He issued a letter to the public more than a week before the publication
        of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>prospectus, "to put them on their
        guard with respect to such publications, lest from the practice of such impositions they
        may be taught to depreciate the worth of the work which I am myself preparing for
        publication before it can possibly appear." The faithful sergeant had now appeared as a
        rival author. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>made sure the public knew that
        only 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Robert Frazer</name>had permission to publish and
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had warned 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer's</name>publishers "not to promise the
        world anything with which they had not the means of complying." Now there were "several
        unauthorised and probably some spurious publications now preparing for the press, on the
        subject of my late tour to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>by individuals entirely unknown
        to me."
        <ref target="n13" n="13"/>
            </p>
            <p>Whether or not 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>fire was directly aimed at 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, it quickly prompted a return from 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">David McKeehan</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>intended publisher. 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan's</name>part in the story requires that
        he receive some attention. His name indicates that he and 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>may have been fellow Irishmen, and like
        
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>he had resided for a time in 
        <name type="place" key="Wellsburg, W. Va.">Wellsburg</name>. These factors may account for
        their partnership, and it could even be that 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>, who opened a book and
        stationery store in 
        <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name>in 1807, persuaded 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>to publish. Many publishers of those
        days were bookstore owners who raised the money for printing and binding by taking
        subscriptions for prospective volumes. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>denunciation was a threat to 
        <name type="place" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan's</name>venture, and he fired back.
        <ref target="n14" n="14"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>obviously had a better than
        average education for the times, and a facility with the pen. He also had a certain talent
        for scurrility, which he put to use against "His Excellency 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>, Esquire, Governor of
        Upper Louisiana," whom he accused of using the dictatorial language of "him who commands
        and dispenses favours." He charged 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>with making "amputations and
        mutilations" in 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer's</name>journal and denigrating his
        abilities in order "to deprive poor 
        <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazer</name>, or those who may have purchased
        from him, of all benefit arising from his publication." 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>informed 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, in the 
        <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, that he intended to publish 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>narrative without asking 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>permission. The rest of a
        lengthy public letter consisted of gratuitous abuse of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, claiming that he sought to keep
        all profit or benefit from the expedition for himself, in spite of the rewards he had
        already received from the government, suppressing any other publication. 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>suggested that the public might
        be interested in 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>story, even if his scientific
        qualifications were nil, and implied that the useful geographic information from the
        captain's journals would be found also in 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>himself, noted 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>, was not a trained scientist.
        The bookseller closed with some sarcasm concerning the wound accidentally inflicted on 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>by 
        <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</name>, "if not 
        <hi rend="italic">honorable</hi>, near the 
        <hi rend="italic">place of honor</hi>," implying it was not an accident. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had the good sense not to reply to
        this blast.
        <ref target="n15" n="15"/>

            <p>
               <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan's</name>talents as a writer are
        relevant because the version of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>journal we have is his to a
        considerable extent. 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>himself acknowledged that "I have
        arranged and transcribed it for the press, supplying such geographical notes and other
        observations as I supposed would render it more useful and satisfactory to the reader."
        <ref target="n16" n="16"/>Estimates of his effort have varied considerably, but most
        readers have agreed that 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan's</name>elegant style was probably very
        different from that of a rough-and-ready frontier sergeant. There are some gaps in the
        entries, undoubtedly those of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>himself, but there is no reason to
        think that the bookseller substantially altered the facts as 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>presented them. The work agrees well
        with the captains' journals, and sometimes adds to them. 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>is the only one, as noted, to give any
        of the dimensions of 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and the only expedition
        journal keeper to describe how the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>and

        <ref target="n17" n="17"/>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever happened to 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>original, there was little danger of
        the 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>version being lost to the world.
        By 1814 six additional editions had appeared, in 
        <name type="place" key="London">London</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Paris">Paris</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Weimar">Weimar</name>, and 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>. The 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>editions, published by
        Mathew Carey, included some quaint and highly imaginative engravings of scenes from the
        expedition which have often been reproduced in subsequent works. It was the first
        published work of any length dealing with the expedition, other than some spurious
        "instant books" based on their generally anonymous authors' imaginations and material
        lifted from earlier explorers' accounts. One reason for the repeated republication of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>work was undoubtedly the delay in the
        appearance of the official account by 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>.
        <ref target="n18" n="18"/>
            </p>
            <p>In his fusillade against 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>quoted from a certificate he said
        the captain had given 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>. In it he acknowledges "the ample
        support, which he gave me under every difficulty; the manly firmness, which he evinced on
        every necessary occasion; and the fortitude with which he bore . . . the fatigues and
        painful sufferings incident to that long voyage."
        <ref target="n19" n="19"/>These are in fact Lewis's words to the Secretary of War,
        recommending favorable treatment for all his men, but they apply to 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>as much as to any man of the
        party. His account has stood by itself for many years; now it appears with those of his
        comrades.</p>
