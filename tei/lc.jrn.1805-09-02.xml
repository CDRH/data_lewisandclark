                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 2nd Sept. 1805</hi>.    a cloudy wet morning.
             we loaded our horses and Set out about 7 oClock, and proceeded on.
             the way we had to go was verry bad    Some places thick bushes
          and logs to pass over.    other places rockey.    our course about
          N. E.    crossed Several creeks or large Spring runs the water of which was
          verry cold. Saw a nomber of large beaver dams and beaver ponds on this creek.
             the pine and balsom fir timber tall and Strait, and pleanty. Some of the
          pine is large enofe for canoes or boards &amp;C.    considerable of common
          alder along the creeks and runs.    we proceeded on up the creek   
          passed through verry bad thickets where we were oblidged to cut a road for our horses to
          pass through.    handsom tall strait pine and balsom fir and a little cotton
          intermixed.    crossed Several branches. Some places muddy.    we
          call this place 
          <name type="place" key="Dismal Swamp">dismal Swamp</name>.
          <ref target="n22090203" n="3"/>   Several beaver dams in it &amp;C. Some
          places Steep along the edge of the mountains and verry rough and rockey.   
          the mountains make close on each Side of the creek and high covred with pine.
             this is a verry lonesome place. Some of our weak horses fell backward
          climeing the Steep rockey hills, and mountains.    we had considerable of
          trouble this day carring Several of the horses loads up the steep rockey mont.
             one of the horses gave out So that he could not carry his load.
             we went 13 miles this day and Camped
          <ref target="n22090204" n="4"/>in a thicket near the creek.    it was about
          six miles through the thicket which we call the 
          <name type="place" key="Dismal Swamp">dismal Swamp</name>.    nothing killed
          this day by the hunters only a fiew fessents.
          <ref target="n22090205" n="5"/>   no game of any kind to be Seen in these
          mountains.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 2nd.</hi>   The morning was cloudy. We set out early;
          proceeded up the creek, and passed some part closely timbered with spruce and pine. We
          went on with difficulty on account of the bushes, the narrowness of the way and stones
          that injured our horses feet, they being without shoes. In the forenoon we killed some
          pheasants
          <ref target="n22090206" n="6"/>and ducks, and a small squirrel. In the afternoon we had
          a good deal of rain, and the worst road (if road it can be called) that was ever
          travelled. The creek is become small and the hills come close in upon the banks of it,
          covered thick with standing timber and fallen trees; so that in some places we were
          obliged to go up the sides of the hills, which are very steep, and then down again in
          order to get along at all. In going up these ascents the horses would sometimes fall
          backwards, which injured them very much; and one was so badly hurt that the driver was
          obliged to leave his load on the side of one of the hills. In the low ground there are
          most beautiful tall straight pine trees of different kinds, except of white pine.
          <ref target="n22090207" n="7"/>Game is scarce; and a small quantity of dried salmon,
          which we got from the natives is almost our whole stock of provisions. A son of our
          guide joined us to day and is going on. We went 13 miles and encamped;
          <ref target="n22090208" n="8"/>but some of the men did not come up till late at
          night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 2nd Sept. 1805</hi>.    a wet cloudy morning.
             we loaded our horses and Set out about 7 oClock and proced on.   
          the road bad    Some places thick bushes and [logs?] to cross.   
          other places rockey.    went about a N. E. course up the abo. ment.
          <ref target="n22090209" n="9"/>Creek.    Crossed Several large Spring runs.
             Saw a nomber of large beaver dams &amp; ponds    the pine and
          bolsom fer timber verry pleanty and thick up this Creek    Some of the Pine is
          large enofe for boards [
          <hi rend="italic">several words illegible</hi>]    we proceeded on through a
          bad thicket of tall Strait pitch pine bolsom fer &amp; cotton timber    we
          were obledged to cut a road for the horses to go and some places verry Steep and rockey.
             we followed the creek up, crossed a nomber of fine Spring branches and
          waided the creek a nomber of times.    the mountains on each Side of the Creek
          is verry Steep and high.    the bottoms on the Creek narrow and Swampy a
          nomber of beaver dams.    we Call this place 
          <name type="place" key="Dismal Swamp">dismal Swamp</name>, and it is a lonesom rough
          part of the Country.    we were obledged to climb Several hills with our
          horses, where it was So Steep and rockey that Some of the horses which was weak and
          their feet Sore, that they fell back    3 or 4 fell over backwards and roled
          to the foot of the hills.    we were then obledged to carry the loads up the
          hills and then load again.    one of the horses gave out So that his load was
          left a little before night.    we Came 13 miles this day and Camped in a
          thicket of pine and bolsom fir timber near the Creek.    2 of the men came up
          with their horses and loads after dark.    this horrid bad going where we came
          up this creek which we Call 
          <name type="place" key="Dismal Swamp">dismal Swamp</name>was six miles and we are not
          out of it yet, but our guide tells us that we will git on a plain tomorrow.   
          Several fessons killed this day, but no other kind of game Seen by our hunters.—</p>
               <p>Monday September 2nd    A cloudy wet morning, We set out with our horses
          &amp; proceeded on our Journey, and about 7 o'Clock A. M. we passed some very bad Roads,
          some being plains with very thick bushes, and low slashes to cross, other places, very
          rockey, we went a North east course up the Creek above mention'd.    We
          recrossed the same Creek near a large spring run,—    where we saw a number of
          high beaver dams.    We saw also Pitch pine &amp; Balsam fir Trees in great
          abundance, on the Tops of the Mountains, We passed through a bad thicket of tall strait
          Pitch pine, balsam fir, &amp; Cotton wood Timber 〈so〉 which grew so close to each other
          that we were obliged to cut a road for our horses to pass through.—</p>
               <p>Some of those places were very steep &amp; Rockey.—    We continued our
          course up the side of the Creek already mentioned this day, and crossed a number of fine
          Spring branches, and waided in the Creek a number of times.    The Mountains
          that lies on both sides of this Creek are very steep &amp; high; the bottoms on this
          Creek narrow &amp; swampey, And had a vast number of beaver dams, on them   
          We named this place 
          <name type="place" key="Dismal Swamp">Dismal swamp</name>, &amp; it was certainly a
          lonesome rough looking part of the Country.—    We were obliged to Climb
          several hills with our horses, where the hills was so steep &amp; rockey, 〈which〉 some
          of the horses that was weak &amp; had sore feet fell backward with their loads; and
          rolled down to the foot of those hills, we were obliged to carry the loads of our
          horses, on our backs up many of the hills, &amp; then load them again.    One
          of our horses gave out, so that we were obliged to leave his load.—    We came
          about 13 Miles this day, &amp; encamped in a thicket of pine trees, and balsam fir
          timber; near the Creek.—    Two of our Men came up with their horses &amp;
          loads after it was dark.—    We came about 6 Miles through this bad road, all
          of which way was very bad travelling, and we are informed by our guide, that we have
          still further to go, before we get to the plains, which he says will be tomorrow, Our
          Hunters killed several Pheasants this day, but saw no other kind of Game.—</p>
