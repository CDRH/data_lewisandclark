          plant
          <ref target="n03051414" n="14"/>with a large Circular floating leaf found in the ponds
          and marshes in the neighbourhood of 
          <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskias</name>&amp; 
          <name type="place" key="Cahokia, Ill.">Cahokia</name>—
          <hi rend="italic">Po-kish'-a-co-mah</hi>, of the root of this plant the Indians prepare
          an agreable dish, the root when taken in it's green state is from 8 to 14 inches in
          circumpherence    is dryed by being exposed to the sun and air or at other
          times with a slow fire or smoke of the chimnies, it shrinks much in drying—   
          The root of this plant grows in a horrizontal direction near the surface of the rich
          loam or mud which forms the bottoms of their ponds or morasses, generall three,
          sometimes four or more of these roots are attatced together by a small root or string of
          hearder substance of a foot or six inches in length, the root of the plant thus annually
          progresses shooting out a root from a bud at the extremity of the root of the
          presceeding years groath, this in the course of the Summer p[r]oduces a new root
          prepared with a bud for the progression of the next season, also one leaf and one seed
          stalk the stem of the former supporting or reather attatched to a large green circular
          leaf 18 inches to two feet in diameter which fl[o]ats while green usually on the serface
          of the water, the sta[l]k is propotioned to the debth of the water, and of a celindrical
          form, is an inch and a half in circumpherence at or near it's junction of the root
          thence regularly tapering to the leaf where it is perhaps not more than an inch, the
          large fibers of the leaf project from the extremity of the stalk in every direction at
          right angles from it to the circumpherence of the leaf like rays from the center, there
          are from twelve to eighteen of those fibers—    the leaf is nearly a circle
          smoth on both sides and even and regular on it's edges—    near the same part
          of the root from which the leaf stalk project the seed stalk dose also—    it
          is about the same size and form of it but usually a foot longer standing erect and
          bearing it[s] blossum above the surface of the water which I am informed is of a white
          colour—    The seed vessel or matrix is the form of a depressed cone the small
          extremity of which is attatced to the uper end of the stalk; before it has attained it's
          groath it resembles an inverted cone but when grown the base obtains a preponderancy and
          inclining downwards rests it's edge against the stalk—    the base is a
          perfect circular plain from 〈fifteen to〉 eighteen to twenty inches in circumpherence in
          it's succulent state, and from two to three inches in hight—    the surface of
          the cone when dryed by the sun and air after being exposed to the frost is purforated
          with two circular ranges of globular holes from twenty to 30 in number arond one which
          forms the center placed at the distance of from an eighth to ¼ of an inch assunder, each
          of those cells contains an oval nut of a light brown colour much resembling a small
          white oak acorn smothe extreemly heard, and containing a white cernal of an agreeable
          flavor; these the native frequently eat either in this state or roasted; they frequently
          eat them also in their succulent state—    the bear feed on the leaves of this
          plant in the spring and summer—    in the autumn and winter the Swan, geese,
          brant, ducks and other acquatic fowls feed on the root—    the one is brown,
          pitty and extreemly light, and when seperated from the stalks flots on the suface of the
          water with its base down—    the Indians procure it and prepare it for food in
          the following manner—    they enter the bonds [ponds] where it grows,
          barefooted in autumn, and feel for it among the mud which being soft and the root large
          and near the surface they readily find it    they easily draw it up it having
          no fiborus, or colateral roots to attatch it firmly to the mud    they wash
          and scrape a thin bleack rind off it and cut it croswise into pieces of an inch in
          length    when it is prepared for the pot it is of a fine white colour boils
          to a pulp and makes an agreeable soupe in which way it is usually dressed by the natives
             when they wish to preserve it for any length of time they cut it in pieces
          in the manner before discribed string it on bark or leather throngs of a convenient
          length and hang it to dry in the sun, or exposed it to the smoke of their chimnies, when
          thus dryed it will keep for several years, it is esteemed as nutricius as the pumpkin or
          squash and is not very dissimilar in taste—    The

          <hi rend="italic">Wab-bis-sa-pin</hi>or Swan-root—
          <ref target="n03051415" n="15"/>   The ferench or Canadians know it by two
          names the Pois de Shicoriat or Graine de Volais—    the roots of this plant
          are from one foot to eighteen inches in length—</p>
               <p>The common wild pittatoe
          <ref target="n03051416" n="16"/>also form another article of food in savage life
             this they boil untill the skin leaves the pulp easily which it will do in
          the course of a few minutes    the outer rind which is of a dark brown coulour
          is then scaped off    the pulp is of a white coulour, the pettatoe thus
          prepared is exposed on a scaffold to the sun or a slow fire untill it is thoroughly
          dryed, or at other times strung upon throngs of leather or bark and hung in the roofs of
          their lodges where by the influence of the fire and smoke it becomes throughly dryed,
          they are then prepared for use, and will keep perfectly sound many years, these they
          boil with meat or pound and make an agreeable bread    this pittaitoee may be
          used in it's green or undryed state without danger provided it be well roasted or
          boiled—    it produces a vine which runs too a considerable length usually
          intwining itself about the neighbouring bushes and weeds, the vine is somewhat branched,
          and in it[s] progress at the distance of 2½ inches it puts forth one leaf stem at right
          angles with the vine, which is furnished with two par of ovate leaves and turminated by
          one of a similar shape, these are of a pale green colour not indented on their edges,
          reather a rough appearance, the vine is small and green except near the ground where it
          sometime assumes a redish hue—    the fruit is connected by a small liggament
          at both ends extending for many yards in length and attatching together in some
          instances six eight or more of these pittaitoes—    it's root is pereniel
             the vine annual.</p>
               <p>There is also another root
          <ref target="n03051417" n="17"/>found in mashey lands or ponds which is much used by

                  <ref target="n03051418" n="18"/>   this in it's unprepared state is not only
          disagreeable to the taste but even dangerous to be taken even in a small quantity; in
          this state it acts as a powerfull aemetic.    a small quantity will kill a hog
          yet prepared by the Indians it makes not only an agreeable but a nutricious food—
             I have not seen the plant and can therefore only discribe it from
          information—    the leaf is said to be broad and to float on the water—
             the root is from 10 to 12 inches in length and about ⅔ds. as much in
          thickness—    it has a rough black skin, the pulp is white and of a mealy
          substance    when properly prepared the preparation is this—   
          having collected a parsel of these roots you cut and split a sufficient parsel of wood
          which is set on end as the coliers commence the base of their coal pitts, the [l]enghts
          of these sticks of wood being as nearly the same as you can conveniently cut them and
          about 4 feet in length thus forming when put together an even surface at top
             on this is thrown soft earth of from two to 3 Inches in debth the roots are
          laid on this and earth thrown over the whole forming the Colliers kiln complete
             fire is then communicated to the wood beneath and it is suffered to burn
          slowly for several days untill the wood is exausted or they concieve their roots are
          sufficiently cooked—    they then take them out scrape them &amp; cut them
          into slices crosswise of half an inch thick and laying them on a scaffold of small
          sticks build small fires under them and dry them untill they become perfectly firm
             thus prepared they are fit for uce and will keep for years if not exposed
          to wet—    they are either boiled to a pulp in their soupe or less boiled eat
          them with bears oil or venison and bears flesh—    they sometimes pound it and
          make a bread of it.—</p>
