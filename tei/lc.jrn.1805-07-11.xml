               <p>We had now nothing to do but wait for the canoes; as they had not returned I sent out
          some of the small party with me to hunt; in the evening they returned with a good
          quantity of the flesh of a fat buffaloe which they had killed.    the canoes
          not arrived this evening. I saw several very large grey Eagles today they are a half as
          large again as the common bald Eagle of this country. I do not think the bald Eagle here
          qute so large as those of the U' States; 
          <ref target="n16071101" n="1">the grey Eagle is infinitely larger and is no doubt a
          distinct species.</ref>   this evening a little before the sun set I heared
          two other discharges of this unaccounable artillery of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>proceeding from the same
          quarter that I had before heard it. I now recollected the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name>making mention of the
          nois which they had frequently heard in the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>like thunder; and which
          they said the mountains made; but I paid no attention to the information supposing it
          either false or the fantom of a supersticious immagination. I have also been informed by
          the engages that the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Panis</name>and 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Ricaras</name>give the same account of
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Black Hills">Black mountains</name>which lye West of them.
             this phenomenon the philosophy of the engages readily accounts for; they
          state it to be the bursting of the rich mines of silver which these mounains
          contain.</p>
               <p>This morning 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>dispatched 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>to meet the canoes which
          were detained by the wind to get a couple of axes.    he obtained the axes and
          returned in about two hours.    this man has been unable to work for several
          days in consequence of a 
          <ref target="n16071102" n="2">whitlow on one of his fingers;</ref>a complaint which has
          been very common among the men.    one of the canoes arrived at 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clarks</name>camp about 10 A. M.
             this he had unloaded and set a few miles up the river for a buffaloe which
          had been killed, the party sent killed another in thir rout and brought in the flesh and
          skins of both    they were in good order; his hunters had also killed two deer
          and an Antelope yesterday.    the three other canoes did not arrive untill
          late in the evening in consequence of the wind and the fear of weting their loads which
          consisted of articles much more liable to be injured by moisture than those which
          composed the load of that which arrived in the morning. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>had the canoes unloaded and
          ordered them to float down in the course of the night to my camp, but the wind proved so
          high after night that they were obliged to put too about 8 miles above and remain untill
          morning. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>kept the party with him busily
          engaged at the canoes.    his hunters killed and brought in three very fat
          deer this evening.—</p>

          Canoe to get the meat    they killed another buffalow near the one killed and

          unloaded &amp; returned imeadeately with orders to flote down to Camp at the portage to
          night for the purpose of takeing up the remaining baggage. Musquitors verry troublesom,
          and in addition to their torments we have a Small Knat, which is as disagreeable, our
          hunter killed 3 Deer to day one of them verry fat.    all the men with me
