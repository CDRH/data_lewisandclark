               <p>This morning we set forward at an early hour; the weather dark and cloudy, the are
          smokey, had a few drops of rain; we employed the chord generally to which we also gave
          the assistance of the pole at the riffles and rocky points; these are as numerous and
          many of them much worse than those we passed yesterday; arround those points the water
          drives with great force, and we are obliged in many instaces to steer our vessels
          through the appertures formed by the points of large sharp rocks which reach a few
          inches above the surface of the water, here sould [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: Should</hi>] our chord give way the bough is instantly drivin
          outwards by the stream and the vessel thrown with her side on the rocks where she must
          inevitably overset or perhaps be dashed to peices; our ropes are but slender, all of
          them except one being made of Elk's skin and much woarn, frequently wet and exposed to
          the heat of the weather are weak and rotten; they have given way several times in the
          course of the day but happily at such places that the vessel had room to wheel free of
          the rocks and therefore escaped injury; with every precaution we can take it is with
          much labour and infinite risk that we are enabled to get around these points.
             found a new indian lodge pole today which had been brought down by the
          stream, it was woarn at one end as if draged by dogs or horses; a football also,
          <ref target="n14052801" n="1"/>and several other articles were found, which have been
          recently brought down by the courant; these are strong evedences of Indians being on the
          river above us, and probably at no great distance; the football is such as I have seen
          among the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetaries</name>and therefore think it
          most probable that they are a band of the

          <ref target="n14052802" n="2"/>   the river country &amp;c continued much as
          yesterday untill late in the evening when we arrived at the entrance of a large Creek
          discharges itself on the Stard. side, is 35 Yd. wide and contains runing water; [

          <ref target="n14052803" n="3"/>   here the hills recede from the river on
          both sides, the bottoms extensive particularly on the Stard. side where the hills are
          comparitively low and open into three large vallies which extend for a considerable
          distance in a Northwardly direction; here also the river spreads to more than 3 times
          it's former width and is filled with a number of small and handsome Islands covered with
          cottonwood some timber also in the bottoms, the land again fertile. These appearances
          were quite reviving after the drairy country through which we had been passing.

          part of the day and killed a big horned anamal; he saw a great number of them as well as
          ourselves in the broken country.       at 10 A. M. a few drops of
          rain again fell and were attended with distant thunder which is the first we have heared
          since we left the

          evening we encamped on Stard. opposite to the entrance of a small [

          <ref target="n14052804" n="4"/>I beleive the bighorn have their young at a very early
          season, say early in March for they appear now to be half grown. One of the party saw a
          very large bear today but being some distance from the river and no timber to conceal
          him he did not think proper to fire on him.</p>
