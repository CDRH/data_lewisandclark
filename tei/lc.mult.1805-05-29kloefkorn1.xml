               <hi rend="right"/>Last night we were all allarmed by a large buffaloe Bull, which swam
        over from the opposite shore and coming along side of the white perogue, climbed over it
        to land, he then alarmed ran up the bank in full speed directly towards the fires, and was
        within 18 inches of the heads of some of the men who lay sleeping before the centinel
        could allarm him or make him change his course, still more alarmed, he now took his
        direction immediately towards our lodge, passing between 4 fires and within a few inches
        of the heads of one range of the men as they yet lay sleeping, when he came near the tent,
        my dog saved us by causing him to change his course a second time, which he did by turning
        a little to the right, and was quickly out of sight, leaving us by this time all in an
        uproar with our guns in or hands, enquiring of each other the case of the alarm, which
        after a few moments was explained by the centinel; we were happy to find no one hirt.</p>
