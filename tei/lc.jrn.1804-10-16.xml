This day took a small bird [<hi rend="italic">EC: Phalaenoptilus nuttalli</hi>] alive of the order of the [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] or goat suckers.    it appeared to be passing into the dormant state.    on the morning of the 18th the murcury was at 30 a[bove] 0. the bird could scarcely move.—    I run my penknife into it's body under the wing and completely distroyed it's lungs and heart—    yet it lived upwards of two hours    this fanominon I could not account for unless it proceeded from the want of circulation of the blo[o]d.—    the recarees call this bird to'-na    it's note is at-tah-to'-nah'; at-tah'to'-nah'; to-nah,    a nocturnal bird, sings only in the night as does the whipperwill.—    it's weight—1 oz 17 Grains Troy
