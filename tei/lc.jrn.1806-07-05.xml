                  <hi rend="italic">Saturday 5th.</hi>   We had another beautiful morning, set
          out early and proceeded on the same course as yesterday through a rough country, with a
          number of branches or small streams flowing from the hills. We killed one deer, and
          about 11 o'clock came to a valley three quarters of a mile wide,
          <ref target="n37070520" n="20"/>all plains, where we halted to dine and to let our
          horses feed. The hills upon each side are handsomely covered with timber of the fir
          kind. While we rested here one of hunters killed a cabre or antelope. At 1 o'clock we
          proceeded on again up the valley. When we had gone about nine miles we came to and
          crossed a river,
          <ref target="n37070521" n="21"/>about 35 yards wide, which flows in with a rapid
          current from some snow topped mountains on the north,
          <ref target="n37070522" n="22"/>where the valley is two or three miles wide. Having
          gone about four miles further we came to the head of the valley, where the hills came
          close upon the river for two miles. After we had passed these narrows we came to another
          large and beautiful valley four or five miles wide, and all plains, except some timber
          on the river banks. In the evening we encamped
          <ref target="n37070523" n="23"/>on the bank of a handsome creek which comes in from the
          north, bold stream of 15 yards wide.</p>
