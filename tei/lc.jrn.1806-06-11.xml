               <p>All our hunters were out this morning by daylight; 
          <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labuish</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>only proved successful, the former
          killed a black bear of the brown speceis
          <ref target="n36061101" n="1"/>and a very large buck, the latter also killed a fine fat
          buck.    five of the Indians also turned out and hunted untill noon, when they
          returned without having killed anything; at three P. M. the left us on their return to
          ther villages.    previous to their departure one of our men exchanged an
          indifferent horse with one of them for a very good one.    in the evening our
          hunters resumed the chase; as game has become scarce and shye near our camp they were
          directed to hunt at a greater distance and therefore set our prepared to remain 〈out〉
          all night and make a mornings hunt in grounds not recently frequented. 
          <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>returned this morning to
          our camp on the 
          <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Kooskooske</name>
                  <ref target="n36061102" n="2"/>in surch of his horse.—    As I have had
          frequent occasion to mention the plant which the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Choppunish</name>call quawmash
          <ref target="n36061103" n="3"/>I shall here give a more particular discription of that
          plant and the mode of preparing it for food as practiced by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name>and others in the
          vicinity of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>with whom it forms much
          the greatest portion of their subsistence.    we have never met with this
          plant but in or adjacent to a piny or fir timbered country, and there always in the open
          grounds and glades; in the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbian</name>vally and near the coast it is
          to be found in small quantities and inferior in size to that found in this neighbourhood
          and in the high rich flatts and vallees within the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>.    it
          delights in a black rich moist soil, and even grows most luxuriantly where the land
          remains from 6 to nine inches under water untill the seed are nearly perfect which in
          this neighbourhood or on these flats is about the last of this month. neare the river
          where I had an opportunity of observing it the seed were begining to ripen on the 9th
          inst. and the soil was nearly dry.    it seems devoted to it's particular soil
          and situation, and you will seldom find it more than a few feet from the inundated soil
          tho' within it's limits it grows very closely in short almost as much so as the bulbs
          will permit; the radix is a tunicated bulb, much the consistence shape and appearance of
          the onion, glutanous or somewhat 〈slymy〉 [
          <hi rend="italic">EC?: mucous</hi>] when chewed and almost tasteless and without smell
          in it's unprepared state; it is white except the thin or outer tunicated scales which
          are few black and not succulent; this bulb is from the size of a nutmeg to that of a
          hens egg and most commonly of an intermediate size or about as large as an onion of one
          years growth from the seed.    the radicles are numerous, reather large,
          white, flexable, succulent and diverging.    the foliage consists of from one
          to four seldom five radicale, linear sessile and revolute pointed leaves; they are from
          12 to 18 inches in length and from 1 to ¾ of an inch in widest part which is near the
          middle; the uper disk is somewhat groved of a pale green and marked it's whole length
          with a number of small longitudinal channels; the under disk is a deep glossy green and
          smooth. the leaves sheath the peduncle and each other as high as the surface of the
          earth or about 2 inches; they are more succulent than the grasses and less so than most
          of the lillies hyesinths &amp;c.—    the peduncle is soletary, proceeds from
          the root, is columner, smooth leafless and rises to the hight of 2 or 2½ feet.
             it supports from 10 to forty flowers which are each supported by seperate
          footstalk of ½ an inch in length scattered without order on the upper portion of the
          peduncle.    the calix is a partial involucret situated at the base of the
          footstalk of each flower on the peduncle; it is long thin and begins to decline as soon
          as the corolla expands.    the corolla consists of six long oval, obtusly
          pointed skye blue or water coloured petals, each about 1 inch in length; the corolla is
          regular as to the form and size of the petals but irregular as to their position, five
          of them are placed near ech other pointing upward while one stands horizantally or
          pointing downwards, they are inserted with a short claw on the extremity of the
          footstalk at the base of the germ; the corolla is of course inferior; it is also
          shriveling, and continues untill the seeds are perfect. The stamens are perfect, six in
          number; the filaments each elivate an anther, near their base are flat on the inside and
          rounded on the outer terminate in a subulate point, are bowed or bent upwards, inserted
          on the inner side and on the base of the claws of the petals, below the germ, are equal
          both with rispect to themselves and the corolla, smooth &amp; membraneous.   
          the Anther is oblong, obtusely pointed, 2 horned or forked at one end and furrowed
          longitudinally with four channels, the upper and lower of which seem almost to divide it
          into two loabs, incumbent patent, membranous, very short, naked, two valved and fertile
          with pollen, which last is of a yellow colour—.    the anther in a few hours
          after the corolla unfoalds, bursts, discharges it's pollen and becomes very minute and
          shrivled; the above discription of the anther is therefore to be understood of it at the
          moment of it's first appearance.    the pistillum is only one, of which, the
          germ is triangular reather swolen on the sides, smooth superior, sessile, pedicelled,
          short in proportion to the corolla atho' wide or bulky; the style is very long or longer
          than the stamens, simple, cilindrical, bowed or bent upwards, placed on the top of the
          germ, membranous shrivels and falls off when the pericarp has obtained its full size.
             the stigma is three cleft very minute, &amp; pubescent.    the
          pericarp is a capsule, triangular, oblong, obtuse, and trilocular with three
          longitudinal valves.    the seed so far as I could judge are numerous not very
          minute and globelar.—    soon after the seeds are mature the peduncle and
          foliage of this plant perishes, the grownd becomes dry or nearly so and the root
          encreases in size and shortly becomes fit for use; this happens about the middle of July
          when the natives begin to collect it for use which they continue untill the leaves of
          the plant attain some size in the spring of the year.    when they have
          collected a considerable quantity of these roots or 20 30 bushels which they readily do
          by means of stick sharpened at one end, they dig away the surface of the earth forming a
          circular concavity of 2½ feet in the center and 10 feet in diameter; they next collect a
          parsel of split dry wood with which they cover this bason in the grown perhaps a foot
          thick, they next collect a large parsel of stones of about 4 or 6 lbs. weight which are
          placed on the dry wood; fire is then set to the wood which birning heats the stones;
          when the fire has subsided and the stones are sufficiently heated which are nearly a red
          heat, they are adjusted in such manner in the whole as to form as level a surface as
          pissible, a small quantity of earth is sprinkled over the stones and a layer of grass
          about an inch thick is put over the stones; the roots, which have been previously
          devested of the black or outer coat and radicles which rub off easily with the fingers,
          are now laid on in a conical pile, are then covered with a layer of grass about 2 or 3
          inches thick; water is now thrown on the summit of the pile and passes through the roots
          and to the hot stones at bottom; some water is allso poared arround the edges of the
          hole and also finds its way to the hot stones; as soon as they discover from the
          quantity of steem which issues that the water has found its way generally to the hot
          stones, they cover the roots and grass over with earth to the debth of four inches and
          then build a fire of dry wood all over the conincal mound which they continue to renew
          through the course of the night or for ten or 12 hours after which it is suffered to
          cool two or three hours when the earth and grass are removed and the roots thus sweated
          and cooked with steam are taken out, and most commonly exposed to the sun on scaffoalds
          untill they become dry, when they are black and of a sweet agreeable flavor.
             these roots are fit for use when first taken from the pitt, are soft of a
          sweetish tast and much the consistency of a roasted onion; but if they are suffered to
          remain in bulk 24 hour after being cooked they spoil.    if the design is to
          make bread or cakes of these roots they undergo a second process of baking being
          previously pounded after the fist baking between two stones untill they are reduced to
          the consistency of dough and then rolled in grass in cakes of eight or ten lbs are
          returned to the sweat intermixed with fresh roots in order that the steam may get freely
          to these loaves of bread.    when taken out the second time the women make up
          this dough into cakes of various shapes and sizes usually from ½ to ¾ of an inch thick
          and expose it on sticks to dry in the sun, or place it over the smoke of their fires.—
             the bread this prepared if kept free from moisture will keep sound for a
          great length of time. this bread or the dryed roots are frequently eaten alone by the
          natives without further preparation, and when they have them in abundance they form an
          ingredient in almost every dish they prepared.    this root is palateable but
          disagrees with me in every shape I have ever used it.—</p>

          village.    one of our men exchanged an indifferent horse for a verey good one
          with those people before they left us.    in the evening all our hunters
          turned out in different directions with a view to find some probable Spot of killing
          deer and were directed to lay out all night and hunt in the morning early.

          inundated Soil tho' within it's limits it grows very closely.    in short
          almost as much so as the bulbs will permit.    the radix is a tumicated bulb,

             the corolla consists of five long oval obtusely pointed Skye blue or water
          coloured petals, each about 1 inch in length; the Corolla is regular as to the form and
          size of the petals but irregular as to their position, five of them are placed near each
          other pointing upwards while one stands horozontially, or pointing downwards, they are
          inserted with a Short Claw on the extremity of the footstalk at the base of the germ;
          the corolla is of course inferior; it is also shriveling, and continues untill the Seed
          are perfect. The Stamens are perfect, Six in number; the falaments each elivate an
          anther, near their base are flat on the inner side and rounded on the outer, termonate
          in a subulate point, and bowed or bent upwards inserted on the inner Side and on the
          base of the Claws of the petals, below the germ, are equal both with respect to
          themselves and the Corolla, Smooth membranous.    the Anther is oblong
          obtusely pointed, 2 horned or forked at one end and furrowed longitudinally with four
          channels, the upper and lower of which Seem almost to divide it into two loabs,
          incumbent, patent, membranous, very short, necked, two valved and fertile with pollen,
          which last is of a yellow colour.    the Anther in a fiew hours after the
          Corolla unfoalds, bursts discharges it's pollen and becomes very manute and chrivled;
          the above discription of the Anther is therefore to be understood of it, at the moment
          of it's first appearance.    the pistillum is only one, of which the Germ is
          triangular reather Swolen on the Sides, Smooth, Superior, Sessile, pedicelled, Short in
          proportion to the Corolla tho' wide or bulky; the Style is very long or longer than the
          stamens, simple, cilindrical, bowed or bent upwards, placed on the top of the germ,
          membranous shrivels and falls off when the pericarp has obtained it's full Size.</p>
               <p>the Stigma is three clefts very manute and pubescent.    the pericarp is a
          capsule, triangular, oblong, obtuse, and trilocular with three longitudinal valves.
             the Seed So far as I could judge are noumerous not very manute and
          globilar.—    Soon after the seed are mature the peduncle and foliage of this
          plant perishes, the ground becoms dry or nearly so and the root increases in size and
          shortly become fit for use; this happens about the middle of July when the nativs begin
          to collect it
          <ref target="n36061105" n="5"/>for use which they continue untill the leaves of the
          plant obtain Some Size in the Spring of the year.    when they have Collected
          a considerable quantity of these roots or 20 or 30 bushels which they readily do by
          means of Sticks Sharpened at one end, they dig away the surface of the earth forming a
          cercular concavity of 2½ feet in the center and 10 feet in diameter; they next collect a
          parcel of dry split wood with which they cover this bason from the bottom perhaps a foot
          thick, they next collect a parcel of Stones from 4 to 6 lb. weight which are placed on
          the dry wood; fire is then Set to the wood which burning heats the Stones; when the fire
          has subsided and the Stones are sufficiently heated which are nearly a red heat, they
          are adjusted in such manner in the hole as to form as leavel a Surface as possible, a
          small quantity of earth is Sprinkled over the Stones, and a layer of grass about an inch
          thick is laid over the Stone; the roots which have been previously devested of the black
          or outer coat and radicles which rub off easily with the fingers, are now laid on in a
          circular pile, are then covered with a layer of grass about 2 or 3 inches thick; water
          is then thrown on the Summit of the pile and passes through the roots and to the hot
          Stones at bottom; Some water is also pored around the edges of the hole, and also find
          it's way to the hot Stones.    they cover the roots and grass over with earth
          to the debth of four inches and then build a fire of dry wood all over the Connical
          mound which they Continue to renew through the course of the night or for 10 or 12
          hours, after which it is Suffered to cool, 2 or three hours, when the earth and grass
          are removed.    and the roots thus Sweated are cooled with Steam or taken out,
          and most commonly exposed to the Sun on Scaffolds untill they become dry.   
          when they are black and of a Sweet agreeable flavor.    these roots are fit
          for use when first taken from the pitt, are Soft of a Sweetish taste and much the
          consistancy of a roasted onion; but if they are Suffered to remain in bulk 24 hours
          after being cooked they Spoil.    if the design is to make bread or cakes of
          those roots they undergo a Second preperation of baking being previously pounded after
          the first baking between two Stones untill they are reduced to the consistancy of dough
          and then rolled in grass in cakes of 8 or 10 pounds, are returned to the Sweat
          intermixes with fresh roots in order that the steam may get freely to those loaves of
          bread.    when taken out the Second time the Indn. woman make up this dough
          into cakes of various Shapes and Sizes, usually from ½ to ¾ of an inch thick and expose
          it on sticks to dry in the Sun, or place it over the smoke of their fires.— The bread
          thus prepared if kept free from moisture will Sound for a great length of time.
             this bread or the dryed roots are frequently eaten alone by the nativs
          without further preperation, and when they have them in abundance they form an
          ingrediant in almost every dish they prepare.    this root is palateable but
          disagrees with us in every shape we have ever used it.    the nativs are
          extreemly fond of this root and present it their visiters as a great treat.   
          when we first arrived at the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name>last fall at this
          place our men who were half Starved made So free a use of this root that it made them
          all Sick for Several days after.

          frost. Several of the men
          <ref target="n36061107" n="7"/>turned out to hunt; and returned at noon, having killed
          a bear and two deer. In this plain there are the most strawberry
          <ref target="n36061108" n="8"/>vines I ever saw, and now all in blossom. This plain
          contains about two thousand acres, and is surrounded with beautiful pine timber of
          different kinds. The soil is very good; the underwood among the timber chiefly
          service-berry and gooseberry bushes. In the evening several of the men started, with an
          intention of encamping out to hunt; and one
          <ref target="n36061109" n="9"/>went back to our late camp
          <ref target="n36061110" n="10"/>to look for the horse, which had been left behind. The
          natives all left us and we remained in quietness by ourselves.</p>
