               <p>This morning I felt much better, but somewhat w[e]akened by my disorder.   
          at 8 A. M. I swung my pack, and set forward with my little party.    proceeded
          to the 
          <ref target="n15061101" n="1">point where 
          <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">Rose [

          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's River</name>approaches the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>so nearly.</ref>   from
          this hight we discovered a herd of Elk on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>just above us to which we
          desended and soon killed four of them.    we butchered them and hung up the
          meat and skins in view of the river in order that the party might get them. I determined
          to take dinner here, but before the meal was prepared I was taken with such violent pain
          in the intestens that I was unable to partake of the feast of marrowbones.   
          my pain still increased and towards evening was attended with a high fever; finding
          myself unable to march, I determined to prepare a camp of some willow boughs and remain
          all night.    having brought no medecine with me I resolved to try an
          experiment with some simples; and the Choke cherry which grew abundanly in the bottom
          first struck my attention; 
          <ref target="n15061102" n="2">I directed a parsel of the small twigs to be geathered
          striped of their leaves, cut into pieces of about 2 Inches in length and boiled in water
          untill a strong black decoction of an astringent bitter tast was produced;</ref>at
          sunset I took a point [pint] of this decoction and abut an hour after repeated the dze
             by 10 in the evening I was entirely releived from pain and in fact every
          symptom of the disorder forsook me; my fever abated, a gentle perspiration was produced
          and I had a comfortable and refreshing nights rest. 
          <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>who is remarkably fond of

          fins resembles the white chub common to the

          than the Chubb and the mouth is beset both above and below with a rim of fine sharp
          teeth; the eye moderately large, the puple dark and the iris which is narrow is of a
          yellowish brown colour, they bite at meat or grasshoppers.    this is a soft
          fish, not very good, tho' the flesh is of a fine white colour.    the other
          species is precisely the form and about the size of the well known fish called the

          beset with long sharp teeth bending inwards, the eye of this fish is very large, and the
          iris of a silvery colour and wide.    of the 1st species we had caught some
          few before our arrival at the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's</name>river, but of the last we had seen

          river.    the latter kind are much the best, and do not inhabit muddy water;
