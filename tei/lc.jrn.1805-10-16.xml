          to land, and then continued our voyage. About 1 o'clock we came to another rapid, where
          all hands carried a load of the baggage by land about a mile, and then took the canoes
          over the rapids, two at a time, and in that way we got them all down safe and proceeded

          Shore, loaded again and proceeded on over Several more rapids    then came to
          a verry bad rapid, the worst or had the highest waves of any we have yet passd.
             we halted above the rapid and carried considerable of the baggage by land
          about a mile.    then took the canoes Safe over, and loaded up and proceeded
          on down Several more rapids    towards evening we arived at the forks of the
          river
          <ref target="n23101617" n="17"/>which came from a northly direction and is larger than
          this 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columa. R.</name>   the country around
          these forks is level Smooth barron plains not even a tree to be Seen as far as our eyes
          could extend    a fiew willows along the Shores.    we found about 2
          hundred or upwards Camped on the point between the two Rivers.    a verry
          pleasant place.    we Camped near them on the point.    the natives
          Sold us eight dogs and Some fresh Sammon.    the whole band came in a body
          Singing in their form to our fires and Smoaked with us and appeared friendly.
             they have beeds and brass and coper in Small peaces hanging about them,
          which they Sign to us that they got them from white people on a River to the north, and
          Some down about the mouth of this River.    we went [
          <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] miles this day.    passed Several Islands
          &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Wednesday October 16th    A pleasant morning &amp; we set out early; and
          proceeded on; we passed over several bad Rapids, which lay quite across the River, which
          were 〈was〉 full of rocks.    One of our Canoes struck on a rock, which was in
          a rapid, &amp; swung round and remained fast, where she staid, till the Canoe that I was
          in came to their assistance &amp; a small Canoe belonging to our party.    The
          Men from the two Canoes got the load out of the Canoe, &amp; got her off the rock &amp;
          to the shore.    We got the Canoes loaded again &amp; continued on our Voyage.
             we passed over several more bad Rapids; and came to a place in the River,
          where we found a very bad Rapid by far the worst that we had yet seen on this River;
          &amp; we halted our Canoes above the Rapid.    We carried a considerable
          quantity of our baggage about a Mile by land below this rapid.—    We got all
          our canoes safe over this 〈rapid〉 difficult place &amp; loaded them and proceeded on
          down the River; &amp; passed several more Rapids.—    Towards evening we
          arrived at a large fork that came into this River from a Northerly direction &amp; was
          much large than the fork which we descended which we supposed to be the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>.—    The country
          round where the forks of these two Rivers lay 〈is〉 was level &amp; 〈is〉 smooth barren
          plains, with not a Tree to be seen as far as our Eyes could extend.    Along
          the Shores 〈are〉 grew a few Willows.    We found upwards of 200 Indians, that
          were encamped on a point of land, that lay between these two Rivers, in a very pleasant
          situated place.    We Encamped near those Indians on the same point of land.
             These natives came to our encampment &amp; sold us 8 dogs &amp; some fresh
          Salmon.    This whole Band of Indians came in a body, Singing in their manner
          to our fires, Smoaked with us, &amp; appeared friendly.—    These Indians had
          beads, and small pieces of brass &amp; Copper hanging about them, which they made signs
          to us, that they got them from White people, who live on a River; lying to the North of
          this place, &amp; that they also got some of them at the Mouth of this River.
             We passed several Islands this day &amp; came 26 Miles, the Course with us
          is the same as Yesterday.—</p>

        these mountains near that of the 
        <name type="place" key="Peace River">Unjigah or Peace river</name>, discharges its waters

        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>, was the

        the Indians respecting this river before he left the 
        <name type="place" key="Peace River">Unjigah</name>was, 'that it was a large river and ran
        towards the mid-day sun; but did not empty itself into the sea.' This opinion of these
        natives at a distance, with respect to its not emptying itself into the sea, must have
        arisen chiefly from what they had heard of its course, which is east of south and nearly
        parallel to the coast of 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">the Pacific</name>, and of the great distance it
        continued to run in that direction. The accounts he received after arriving at it, 
        <hi rend="italic">there</hi>called the

                  <name type="place" key="Fraser (Tacoutche-Tesse) River">Great river</name>,</hi>or 
        <name type="place" key="Fraser (Tacoutche-Tesse) River">Tacoutche Tesse</name>, also
        stated that it ran towards the mid-day sun; and that at its mouth, as the natives said
        they had been informed, white people were building houses. 
        <name type="person" key="McKenzie, Charles">Mr. McKenzie</name>having descended the river
        some distance, prevailed on a chief to delineate a sketch of the country on a large piece
        of bark; in which he described the river as running to the east of south, receiving many
        rivers, and every six or eight leagues, encumbered with falls and rapids, some of them
        very dangerous and six impracticable. He represented the carrying places as of great
        length, and passing over hills and mountains. He depicted the lands of three other tribes
        in succession who spoke different languages. Beyond them he knew nothing of the river or
        country, only that it was still a long way to the sea; and that, as he had heard, there
        was a lake before they reached the water, which the natives did not drink. 'The more I
        heard of the river,' says 
        <name type="person" key="McKenzie, Charles">Mr. McKenzie</name>, 'the more I was convinced
        it could not empty itself into the ocean to the north of what is called the river of the
        West, so that with its windings the distance must be very great.' It is not improbable
        that the distance by water, from the place 
        <name type="person" key="McKenzie, Charles">Mr. McKenzie</name>struck this river, to its
        mouth (supposing it to be the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, Oregan or Great river of the
        West) is upwards of 1000 miles, and its whole course from its source 1500. By the lake
        mentioned by the Indian chief is no doubt meant the bay at the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, and wide part of the river where
        the tide water ascends and renders the whole unfit to drink." 
        <p>The notion of a Great River of the West as a necessary part of a water route across the
        continent developed well before the actual discovery of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>in 1792. Before
