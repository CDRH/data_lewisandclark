               <p>moderate rain last night, the wind of this morning from the S. E. as to cause the
          water to be So rough that we Could not proceed on untill 8 a. m. at which time it fell a
          little &amp; we proceeded on tho' the waves were yet high and the wind Strong. Saw
          Several Indians on either Side of the river.    at 9 A. M. I saw an Indian
          running down the beech and appd. to be anxious to Speak to us I derected the Canoes to
          land.    this Indian proved to be the brother of the Chief we had on board and
          Came down from his Camp at no great distance to take his leave of his brother.
             the Chief gave him a par of Legins and took an effectunate leave of his
          brother and we procedeed on haveing previously Sent on 2 canoes with hunters to kill
          Some meat at 2 P. M we overtook the Canoe hunters, they had killed three deer which was
          divided and we halted and Cooked Some dinner on the Sandbar.    wind Still
          high and from the Same point. The Chief pointed out Several places where he Said 〈their〉
          his nation formerly lived and related Some extroadinary Stories of their tredition.
          after Dinner we proceeded on, to a point on the N E. Side opposit the remains of an old 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>village a little below the
          enterance of

          this river 20th of October 1804 haveing come 40 miles to day.
          <ref target="n39081801" n="1"/>   after landing which was a little before
          night the hunters run out into the bottom and Killed four deer. The winds blew hard from
          the S. E. all day which retarded our progress very much    after the fires
          were made I set my self down with the 
          <name type="place" key="Big White (Sheheke)">big white</name>man Chiefe and made a
          number of enquiries into the tredition of his nation as well as the time of their
          inhabiting the number of Villages the remains of which we see on different parts of the
          river, as also the cause of their evacuation.    he told me his nation first
          Came out of the ground where they had a great village.    a grape vine grew
          down through the Earth to their village and they Saw light    Some of their
          people assended by the grape vine upon the earth, and Saw Buffalow and every kind of
          animal also Grapes plumbs &amp;c.    they gathered Some grapes &amp; took down
          the vine to the village, and they tasted and found them good, and deturmined to go up
          and live upon the earth, and great numbers climbed the vine and got upon earth men womin
          and children.
          <ref target="n39081802" n="2"/>   at length a large big bellied woman in
          climbing broke the vine and fell and all that were left in the Village below has
          remained there ever Since (The
