Clark</name> had sent at some distance below on the river—    he told me that the horses were heavy loaded and that not being shod it was impossible for horses to travel on the ice. I determined to send down some men with two small slays for the meat and accordingly I gave orders that they should set out early the next morning.    two men were also sent to conduct the horses by way of the plain.
