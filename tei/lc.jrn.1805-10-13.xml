          did not set out till 11 o'clock: we then proceeded with two canoes at a time over the
          rapids, which are about 2 miles in length; and in about two hours got all over safe. We
          then went on again and passed more bad rapids, but got through safe. In the afternoon
          the weather cleared and we had a fine evening. Having gone 23 miles we encamped on the
          north side. The country continues much the same, all high dry prairie. One handsome
          creek

          delayed untill about 10 oClock A. m. then took 2 of the canoes at a time down the
          rapids.    all the men which could not Swim went by land and carried Some
          rifles &amp; Instruments &amp;c.    we got Safe below the rapids by 12 oClock.
             dined on Sammon and proceeded over Several more rapids    the
          wind hard a head.    cleard off about 2 oC. P. m.    we Saw Several
          Old camps where the natives fish in the Spring, but no timber except what they raft down
          a long distance, and they Scaffel it up verry carefully.    towards evening we
          came to a verry rockey place in the River &amp; rapid    the River all
          confined in a narrow channel only about 15
          <ref target="n23101308" n="8"/>yds. wide for about 2 mile and ran as [s]wift as a mill
          tale    the canoes ran down this channel Swifter than any horse could run.
             a great fishery below these rapids.    Saw 2 Indians Swim their
          horses across the River to the N. S. and follow down the River    they have to
          ride fast to keep up with us for the current mostly rapid.    the clifts &amp;
          hills high plains &amp; barrons continues on each Side of the River as usal.
             we Came [
          <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] miles this day and Camped on the Stard Side.   
          passed a Creek on the Lard. Side this aftr. noon.</p>
               <p>Sunday October 13th    This morning we had Rain &amp; delayed setting out
          till about 10 o'Clock A. M.    We took 2 of our Canoes at a time down the
          Rapids.    The Men that were among us, that could not swim, went by land, to
          go below these Rapids.    They carried with them some Rifle Guns &amp;
          Mathematical Instruments &amp;ca.    We were fortunate in getting all our
          Canoes safe over these Rapids, by 12 o'Clock A. M. when we halted to dine on Salmon.
             We proceeded on our Voyage about 2 o'Clock P. M. &amp; passed several old
          fishing Camps, where the Natives come to catch Salmon in the spring of the Year.
             We crossed several more Rapids which were not difficult to pass.
             About 3 o'Clock P. M. the wind rose from the West &amp; the Weather became
          clear &amp; pleasant.    We saw no Timber this day, excepting what the Natives
          had rafted down the River a great distance, which they Scaffold up very carefully.
             Towards evening we came to a very rockey place lying in the River, which
          run very rapid.    The River at this place was confined in a narrow channell,
          &amp; was only about 150 Yards wide for about 2 Miles &amp; ran as swift as Water from a
          Mill tail.—    Our Canoes descended the River at this place with much more
          swiftness than a common horse could run the same distance.    We found below
          these falls a great Indian fishery &amp; saw 2 Indians swim their horses across the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>, to the North side of it.
             They followed us down the River &amp; had to ride fast, to come up with us.
             The current of the River run mostly very rapid, the Hills &amp; plains
          high, &amp; some Clifts of rocks.    The land is very Barren on both sides of
          the River as usual.    We came 35 Miles from the best computation we can make
          this day &amp; encamped on the North side of the River.    Our Course for
          these several days past has been West.    We passed by a Creek this afternoon
          lying on the South side of the River which was small.</p>
