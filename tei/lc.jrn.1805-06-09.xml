               <p>We determined to deposite at this place the large red perogue all the heavy baggage
          which we could possibly do without and some provision, salt, tools powder and Lead
          &amp;c with a view to lighten our vessels and at the same time to strengthen their crews
          by means of the seven hands who have been heretofore employd. in navigating the red
          perogue; accordingly we set some hands to diging a hole or cellar for the reception of
          our stores. these holes in the ground or deposits are called by the engages 
          <hi rend="italic">cashes</hi>[
          <hi rend="italic">NB: cache's</hi>]; on enquiry I found that Cruzatte was well
          acquainted this business and therefore left the management of it intirely to him.
             today we examined our maps, and compared the information derived as well
          from them as from the Indians and fully settled in our minds the propryety of addopting
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>for the
          
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, as that which it would be most
          expedient for us to take. The information of 
          <name type="person" key="Fidler, Peter">Mr. Fidler</name>incorrect as it is strongly
          argued the necessity of taking the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>, for
          if he has been along the Eastern side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountain</name>s as far as even Latd.
          47°, which I think fully as far south as he ever was in that direction, and saw only
          small rivulets making down from those mountains the presumption is very strong that
          those little streams do not penetrate the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky Mountains</name>to such distance as would
          afford rational grownds for a conjecture that they had their sources near any navigable
          branch of the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>, and if he has seen those
          rivulets as far south as 47° they are most probably the waters of some Nothern branch of
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>or 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South
          fork</name>probably the river called by the Indians 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medicine
          River</name>; we therefore cannot hope by going Northwardly of this place being already
          in Latititude 47° 24" to find a stream between this place and the 
          <name type="place" key="Saskatchewan River">Saskashawan</name>which dose penetrate the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name>, and which agreeably to
          the information of the Indians with rispect to the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, dose possess a navigable curent
          some distance in those mountains. The Indian information also argued strongly in favour
          of the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>.
             they informed us that the water of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>was nearly transparent at the
          great falls, this is the case with the water of the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>; that
          the falls lay a little to the South of sunset from them; this is also brobable as we are
          only a few minutes North of 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>bears
          considerably South from hence to the Mountains; that the falls are below the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountain</name>s and near the Nothern
          termineation of one range of those mountains.    a range of mountains which
          apear behind the 
          <name type="place" key="Highwood (South) Mountains">S. Mountains</name>and which appear
          to terminate S. W. from this place and on this side of the unbroken chain of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>gives us hope that this
          part of their information is also correct, and there is sufficient distance between this
          and the mountains for many and I fear for us much too many falls.    another
          impression on my mind is that if the Indians had passed any stream as large as the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>on
          their way to the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>that they would not have omitted
          mentioning it; and the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>from
          it's size and complexion of it's waters must enter the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Ry. Mountains</name>and in my opinion
          penetrates them to a great distance, or els whence such an immence body of water as it
          discharges; it cannot procede from the dry plains to the N. W. of the 
          <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellow Stone river</name>on the East side of
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>for those numerous large
          dry channels which we witnessed on that side as we ascended the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>forbid such a conjecture; and
          that it should take it's sourses to the N. W. under those mountains the travels of Mr.
          Fidler fobid us to beleive. Those ideas as they occurred to me I indevoured to impress
          on the minds of the party all of whom except 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>being still firm in the beleif
          that the N. Fork was the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and that which we ought to take;
          they said very cheerfully that they were ready to follow us any wher we thought proper
          to direct but that they still thought that the other was the river and that they were
          affraid that the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>would
          soon termineate in the mountains and leave us at a great distance from the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. 
          <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Cruzatte</name>who had been an old 
          <name type="person" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>navigator and who from his
          integrity knowledge and skill as a waterman had acquired the confidence of every
          individual of the party declared it as his opinion that the N. fork was the true genuine
          
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and could be no other.
             finding them so determined in this beleif, and wishing that if we were in
          an error to be able to detect it and rectify it as soon as possible it was agreed
          between 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>and myself that one of us should
          set out with a small party by land up the 
          <name type="place" key="Gallatin (South, Southeast Fork) River">South fork</name>and
          continue our rout up it untill we found the falls or reached the snowy Mountains by
          which means we should be enabled to determine this question prety accurately.
             this expedition I prefered undertaking as 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C</name>best waterman &amp;c. and
          determined to set out the day after tomorrow; I wished to make some further observations
          at this place, and as we had determined to leave our blacksmith's bellows and tools here
          it was necessary to repare some of our arms, and particularly my Airgun the main spring
          of which was broken, before we left this place.    these and some other
          preperations will necessarily detain us two perhaps three days. I felt myself very
          unwell this morning and took a portion of salts from which I feel much releif this
          evening. 
          <ref target="n15060901" n="1">The cash being completed I walked to it and examined it's
          construction.</ref>   it is in a high plain about 40 yards distant from a
          steep bluff of the South branch on it's nothern side; the situation a dry one which is
          always necessary.    a place being fixed on for a cash, a circle abut 20
          inches in diameter is first discribed, the terf or sod of this circle is carefully
          removed, being taken out as entire as possible in order that it may be replaced in the
          same situation when the chash is filled and secured.    this circular hole is
          then sunk perpendicularly to the debth of one foot, if the ground be not firm somewhat
          deeper.    they then begin to work it out wider as they proceed downwards
          untill they get it about six or seven feet deep giving it nearly the shape of the kettle
          or lower part of a large still.    it's bottom is also somewhat sunk in the
          center.    the dementions of the cash is in proportion to the quantity of
          articles intended to be deposited.    as the earth is dug it is handed up in a
          vessel and carefully laid on a skin or cloth and then carryed to some place where it can
          be thrown in such manner as to conseal it usually into some runing stream wher it is
          washed away and leaves no traces which might lead to the discovery of the cash.
             before the goods are deposited they must be well dryed; a parsel of small
          dry sticks are then collected and with then [them] a floor is maid of three or four
          inches thick which is then covered with some dry hay or a raw hide well dryed; on this
          the articles are deposited, taking care to keep them from touching the walls by putting
          other dry sticks between as you stoe away the merchandize, when nearly full the goods
          are covered with a skin and earth thrown in and well ramed untill with the addition of
          the turf furst removed the whole is on a level with the serface of the ground.
             in this manner dryed skins or merchandize will keep perfectly sound for
          several years.    the traders of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, particularly those engaged in
          the trade with the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Siouxs</name>are obliged to have frequent
          recourse to this method in order to avoyd being robed.    most of the men are
          busily engaged dressing skins for cloathing. In the evening 
          <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Cruzatte</name>gave us some music on the
          violin and the men passed the evening in dancing singing &amp;c and were extreemly
