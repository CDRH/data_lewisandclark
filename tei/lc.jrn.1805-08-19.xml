               <p>This morning I arrose at dylight and sent out three hunters.    some of the
          men who were much in want of legings and mockersons I suffered to dress some skins.
             the others I employed in repacking the baggage, making pack saddles &amp;c.
             we took up the net this morning but caugt no fish.    one beaver
          was caught in a trap.    the frost which perfectly whitened the grass this
          morning had a singular appearance to me at this season.    this evening I made
          a few of the men construct a sein of willow brush which we hawled and caught a large
          number of fine trout and a kind of mullet
          <ref target="n20081901" n="1"/>about 16 Inhes long which I had not seen before.
             the scales are small, the nose is long and obtusely pointed and exceedes
          the under jaw.    the mouth is not large but opens with foalds at the sides,
          the colour of it's back and sides is of a bluish brown and belley white; it has the
          faggot bones, from which I have supposed it to be of the mullet kind. the tongue and
          pallate are smooth and it has no teeth.    it is by no means as good as the
          trout.    the trout
          <ref target="n20081902" n="2"/>are the same which I first met with at the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">falls of the
          Missouri</name>, they are larger than the speckled trout of our mountains and equally as
          well flavored.—    The hunters returned this evening with two deer.
             from what has 〈already〉 been said of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>it will be readily
          perceived that they live in a wretched stait of poverty.    yet
          notwithstanding their extreem poverty they are not only cheerfull but even gay, fond of
          gaudy dress and amusements; like most other Indians they are great egotists and
          frequently boast of heroic acts which they never performed.    they are also
          fond of games of wrisk.    they are frank, communicative, fair in dealing,
          generous with the little they possess, extreemly honest, and by no means beggarly.
             each individual is his own sovereign master, and acts from the dictates of
          his own mind; the authority of the Cheif being nothing more than mere admonition
          supported by the influence which the propiety of his own exammplery conduct may have
          acquired him in the minds of the individuals who composed the band.    the
          title of cheif is not hereditary, nor can I learn that there is any cerimony of
          instalment, or other epoh in the life of a Cheif from which his title as such can be
          dated.    in fact every man is a chief, but all have not an equal influence on
          the minds of the other members of the community, and he who happens to enjoy the
          greatest share of confidence is the principal Chief. The 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>may be estimated as
          about 100 warriors, and about three times that number of woomen and children.
             they have more children among them than I expected to have seen among a
          people who procure subsistence with such difficulty.    there are but few very
          old persons, nor did they appear to treat those with much tenderness or rispect. The man
          is the sole propryetor of his wives and daughters, and can barter or dispose of either
          as he thinks proper.    a plurality of wives is common among them, but these
          are not generally sisters as with the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetares</name>&amp; 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>but are purchased of
          different fathers. The father frequently disposes of his infant daughters in marriage to
          men who are grown or to men who have sons for whom they think proper to provide wives.
             the compensation given in such cases usually consists of horses or mules
          which the father receives at the time of contract and converts to his own uce.
             the girl remains with her parents untill she is conceived to have obtained
          the age of puberty which with them is considered to be about the age of 13 or 14 years.
             the female at this age is surrendered to her sovereign lord and husband
          agreeably to contract, and with her is frequently restored by the father quite as much
          as he received in the first instance in payment for his daughter; but this is
          discretionary with the father. 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sah-car-gar-we-ah</name>had been thus disposed of
          before she was taken by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name>, or had arrived to
          the years of puberty.    the husband was yet living and with this band.
             he was more than double her age and had two other wives.    he
          claimed her as his wife but said that as she had had a child by another man, who was 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>, that he did not want
          her. They seldom correct their children particularly the boys who soon become masters of
          their own acts.    they give as a reason that it cows and breaks the Sperit of
          the boy to whip him, and that he never recovers his independence of mind after he is
          grown. They treat their women but with little rispect, and compel them to perform every
          species of drudgery.    they collect the wild fruits and roots, attend to the
          horses or assist in that duty cook dreess the skins and make all their apparal, collect
          wood and make their fires, arrange and form their lodges, and when they travel pack the
          horses and take charge of all the baggage; in short the man dose little else except
          attend his horses hunt and fish.    the man considers himself degraded if he
          is compelled to walk any distance, and if he is so unfortunately poor as only to possess
          two horses    he rides the best himself and leavs the woman or women if he has
          more than one, to transport their baggage and children on the other, and to walk if the
          horse is unable to carry the additional weight of their persons—    the
          chastity of their women is not held in high estimation, and the husband will for a
          trifle barter the companion of his bead for a night or longer if he conceives the reward
          adiquate; tho' they are not so importunate that we should caress their women as the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">siouxs</name>were and some of their women
          appear to be held more sacred than in any nation we have seen    I have
          requested the men to give them no cause of jealousy by having connection with their
          women without their knowledge, which with them strange as it may seem is considered as
          disgracefull to the husband as clandestine connections of a similar kind are among
          civilized nations.    to prevent this mutual exchange of good officies
          altogether I know it impossible to effect, particularly on the part of our young men
          whom some months abstanence have made very polite to those tawney damsels.   
          no evil has yet resulted and I hope will not from these connections.—   
          notwithstanding the late loss of horses which this people sustained by the 
          <name type="person" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name>the stock of the band may be
          very safetly estimated at seven hundred of which they are perhaps about 40 coalts and
          half that number of mules.— these people are deminutive in stature, thick ankles,
          crooked legs, thick flat feet and in short but illy formed, at least much more so in
          general than any nation of Indians I ever saw.    their complexion is much
          that of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Siouxs</name>or darker than the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name>
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">mandands</name>or 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shawnee Indians">Shawnees</name>.    generally
          both men and women wear their hair in a loos lank flow over the sholders and face; tho'
          I observed some few men who confined their hair in two equal cues hanging over each ear
          and drawnn in front of the body. the cue is formed with throngs of dressed lather or
          Otterskin aternately crossing each other.    at present most of them have cut
          short in the neck in consequence of the loss of their relations by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minnetares</name>. 
          <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name>has his cut close all over his
          head.    this constitutes their cerimony of morning for their deceased
          relations.    the dress of the men consists of a robe long legings, shirt,
          tippet and Mockersons, that of the women is also a robe, chemise, and Mockersons;
          sometimes they make use of short legings.    the ornements of both men and
          women are very similar, and consist of several species of sea shells, blue and white
          beads, bras and Iron arm bands, plaited cords of the sweet grass, and collars of leather
          ornamented with the quills of the porcupine dyed of various colours among which I
          observed the red, yellow, blue, and black.    the ear is purforated in the
          lower part to receive various ornaments but the nose is not, nor is the ear lasserated
          or disvigored for this purpose as among many nations. the men never mark their skins by
          birning, cuting, nor puncturing and introducing a colouring matter as many nations do.
             there women sometimes puncture a small circle on their forehead nose or
          cheeks and thus introduce a black matter usually soot and grease which leaves an
          indelible stane.    tho' this even is by no means common.    their
          arms offensive and defensive consist in the bow and arrows sheild, some lances, and a
          weapon called by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Chippewa Indians">Cippeways</name>who formerly used it,
          the pog-gar'-mag-gon'.
          <ref target="n20081903" n="3"/>in fishing they employ wairs, gigs, and fishing hooks.
             the salmon is the principal object of their pursuit.    they
          snair wolves and foxes. I was anxious to learn whether these people had the venerial,
          and made the enquiry through 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">the intrepreter</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">his wife</name>; the information was that they
          sometimes had it but I could not learn their remedy; they most usually die with it's
          effects.    this seems a strong proof that these disorders bothe gonaroehah
          and Louis venerae are naive disorders of America.    tho' hese people have
          suffered much by the small pox which is known to be imported and perhaps those other
          disorders might have been contracted from other indian tribes who by a round of
          communication might have obtained from the Europeans since it was introduced into that
          quarter of the globe.    but so much detatched on the other had from all
          communication with the whites that I think it most probable that those disorders are
          original with them.
          <ref target="n20081904" n="4"/>   from the middle of May to the firt of
          September these people reside on the waters of the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>where they consider themselves in
          perfect security from their enimies as they have not as yet ever found their way to this
          retreat; during this season the salmon furnish the principal part of their subsistence
          and as this firsh either perishes or returns about the 1st of September they are
          compelled at this season in surch of subsistence to resort to the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, in the vallies of which, there
          is more game even within the mountains.    here they move slowly down the
          river in order to collect and join other bands either of their own nation or the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>, and having become
          sufficiently strong as they conceive venture on the Eastern side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockey mountains</name>into the plains, where
          the buffaloe abound.   but they never leave the interior of the mountains
          while they can obtain a scanty subsistence, and always return as soon as they have
          acquired a good stock of dryed meat in the plains; when this stock is consumed they
          venture again into the plains; thus alternately obtaining their food at the risk of
          their lives and retiring to the mountains, while they consume it.—    These
          people are now on the eve of their departure for the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, and inform us that they expect
          to be joined at or about the three forks by several bands of their own nation, and a
          band of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>.    as I am
          now two busily engaged to enter at once into a minute discription of the several
          articles which compose their dress, impliments of war hunting fishing &amp;c I shall
          pursue them at my leasure in the order they have here occurred to my mind, and have been
          mentioned. This morning 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">capt. Clark</name>continued his rout with his
          party, the Indians accompanying him as yesterday; he was obliged to feed them.
             nothing remarkable happened during the day.    he was met by an

             The hunters returned in the afternoon, and brought with them 2 deer, which
          they had killed.    We had a Shower of rain about 3 o'Clock P. M. which lasted
          but a few minutes.    We hawled our net across the River but again without
          catching any fish, &amp; find that the only way to catch them is with hook &amp; line.—
