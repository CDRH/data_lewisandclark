            <p>On March 23, 1806, the Corps of Discovery left 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, their winter quarters
        on the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Coast">Pacific Coast</name>, and started back up the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>on their long return journey
        to the United States. It was now nearly two years since they had left 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>bound west; if they could get
        across the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>by the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>early enough, they could descend the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>before it froze and reach
        their starting point in this same year. They were now largely retracing a route they had
        already followed and so did not bother with the detailed courses and distances of the
        outbound journey, but their journals were still filled with the incidents of the voyage
        and descriptions of the country and its people.</p>
            <p>There was still room for new discoveries; on the way down the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>they had missed the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Willamette (Multnomah) River">Willamette River</name>, concealed
        behind islands. They encamped for a week on the north side of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>to hunt and take astronomical
        observations, while 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>made a quick exploration a few miles
        up the new stream. The captains called it the 
        <name type="place" key="Willamette (Multnomah) River">Multnomah</name>after the Indian
        name and regarded it as coming from much deeper in the continent than was really the case.
        On April 6 the party was again on its way.</p>
            <p>They were nearly two weeks getting upriver past the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River, Cascades (Great Rapids, Great Shute)">
        Cascades</name>and the 
        <name type="place" key="Celilo (Great) Falls">Celilo Falls</name>. To the wearisome labor
        of portaging was added the aggravation of bad relations with many of the Indians in the
        vicinity. The natives demanded high prices for any food they sold, and some of them could
        not resist stealing. The captains' patience was at low ebb and they threatened violence if
        stolen goods were not returned. When some Indians made off with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>dog 
        <name type="person" key="Seaman">Seaman</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>sent a party of men to recover his
        friend and companion, with orders to shoot if necessary. Fortunately, no one was killed
        and 
        <name type="person" key="Seaman">Seaman</name>was returned to the Corps.</p>
            <p>Once past the falls they traded canoes for horses to continue their journey by land and
        made their way up the north side of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Walula Indians">Walula</name>(or 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Walula Indians">Walla Walla</name>) Indians, whom they
        found much more hospitable than those lower down the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. On the westward journey the
        captains had promised 
        <name type="person" key="Yelleppit">Chief Yelleppit</name>that they would remain with him
        for a few days on the way back. They kept their promise and camped with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Walula Indians">Walulas</name>from April 27 to 29, at the
        mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Walla Walla (Waller Waller) River">Walla Walla River</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Yelleppit">Yelleppit</name>told them about an overland shortcut
        to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>, so on the thirtieth
        they continued eastward by land following a 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>guide they had met
        several days earlier. They were anxious to reach the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>, with whom they had
        left their horses on the westbound trip.</p>
            <p>This eastbound trip took the party over new ground; going west they had traveled by
        canoe down the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater</name>and 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>rivers
        to the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. With the advice of their guide
        they now took the shortcut between the 
        <name type="place" key="Walla Walla (Waller Waller) River">Walla Walla</name>and the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>,
        passing the present towns of 
        <name type="place" key="Waitsburg, Wash.">Waitsburg</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Dayton, Wash.">Dayton</name>, and 
        <name type="place" key="Pomeroy, Wash.">Pomeroy</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Washington">Washington</name>. They reached the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>a
        little below the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater</name>. On
        the way they met 
        <name type="person" key="Apash Wyakaikt">Wearkoomt</name>, a 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>chief who had been
        helpful to them on their way down the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>the
        previous fall. Having reached the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Snake</name>and
        crossed it on May 4, the party continued up its north side to the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater</name>and up
        the north bank of that river.</p>
            <p>Here in the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>country, in modern
        west-central 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, the captains assumed a new and demanding role
        as physicians to the local people. On the westward trip some medicines they had prescribed
        had eased the ailments of several patients, and had, said 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, "given those nativs and exolted
        oppinion of my skill as a phisician." During a period of nearly six weeks that they were
        forced to remain with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>in May and June of
        1806 they were visited by a host of the afflicted, suffering from a variety of ills,
        notably rheumatic complaints, sore eyes, and abscesses. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was doubtful if any permanent
        cures could result, but the immediate benefit to relations with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>was so great that he
        decided to continue treatment, wishing that they could indeed cure these "poor
        wretches."</p>
            <p>The captains also had to mediate a dispute between the local 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>leaders. The previous
        fall they had left their horses with the hospital chief 
        <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)">Twisted Hair</name>; some more
        prominent chiefs who had then been absent were vexed with him on returning, thinking that
        he had presumed too much in taking on the responsibility. 
        <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)">Twisted Hair</name>, disgusted with
        their criticism, had let the horses wander over a considerable area. Now 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did their best to reconcile the
        squabbling chiefs so that their animals could be recovered.</p>
            <p>On May 14 the party settled in to a camp on the east side of the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater</name>at the
        modern town of 
        <name type="place" key="Kamiah, Idaho">Kamiah</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, where they would remain for nearly a month.
        The 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>told them that it
        would be at least that long before the snows in the 
        <name type="place" key="Bitterroot (Snow) Mountains">Bitterroot Mountains</name>melted
        sufficiently to allow passage east over the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>. Their campsite has come to be
        called 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>after the
        explorers' name for the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>. The party passed
        their time seeking food, counciling and socializing with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>, and obtaining more
        horses for the next stage of the trip.</p>
            <p>Some further medical problems engaged their attention during this lengthy sojourn. 
        <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">William Bratton</name>had been suffering
        ever since 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>from a mysterious back
        ailment which had virtually incapacitated him. No other remedy having worked, the captains
        tried a sweat bath suggested by 
        <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>, the extreme heat being
        alternated with immersion in a cold mountain stream. In a short time 
        <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton's</name>back loosened up and he was
        able to walk again. Another patient was a 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>chief who had suffered
        from paralysis for five years, with no apparent cause. For lack of a better remedy the
        captains subjected him to the sweat-bath treatment, and to their amazement he began
        recovering the use of his limbs.</p>
            <p>Naturally, the two leaders continued their studies of natural history, native culture,
        and geography. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>gathered what information he could
        about country to the north and south of the party's trail, together with the locations of
        Indian tribes, obtaining maps from the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>continued his study of the grizzly
        bears, concluding that in spite of their many color variations they were all of the same
        species. He also discovered the cinnamon bear, a western color variant of the familiar
        black bear. A number of new animals and plants were described, including the pigmy horned
        lizard, western tanager, Columbian ground squirrel, beargrass, and ragged robin. It was
        probably here that they collected what seems to be the only zoological specimen of the
        expedition to have survived to the present day, the skin of a Lewis's woodpecker. In the
        land of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>also made another discovery of a
        root much like the sweet potato. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>description of cous (his "cows")
        is unmistakable; it constituted one of the basic food sources for natives in the
        region.</p>
            <p>In council 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>promised the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>that American traders
        would soon follow them to provide the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>with trade goods,
        especially guns with which to defend themselves against the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>and other enemies. They
        also promised, if they should meet the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>on their eastward trip,
        to try to persuade them to make peace with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>. Their hosts may have
        been a bit skeptical on this point, but the hope of obtaining weapons to match those of
        their enemies inspired even greater regard for their visitors. The men found much to
        admire about their hosts' customs, hospitality, and appearance. The traveling
        ethnographers recorded much about 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>material culture during
        the forced stay. Food, clothes, and housing, of course caught their attention and the
        horse culture of this equestrian people was also a matter of serious consideration.
        Finally, the captains tried to explain 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>attitudes, ceremonies,
        and rituals in their journals.</p>
            <p>By June 9, 1806, the captains decided to begin their move eastward. According to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>the snow would not be
        gone from the mountains along the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>until the beginning of July, but the
        whole party was anxious to start homeward, so they left the valley of the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater</name>for the
        flats above the river, "exolted," 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>says, "with the idea of once more
        proceeding on towards their friends and Country."</p>
