               <p>This morning early we employed all hands; some were making tar or attempting to make
          it, others were attatching the skins on the boat, other cuting and fiting the bark for
          lining puting in the woodworke &amp;c    
          <ref target="n16070301" n="1">some hunters</ref>were sent out to kill buffaloe in order
          to make pemecon to take with us and also for their skins which we now wa[n]t to cover
          our baggage in the boat and canoes when we depart from hence.    the Indians
          have informed us that we should shortly leave the buffaloe country after passing 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>; this I
          much regret for I know when we leave the buffaloe that we shal sometimes be under the
          necessity of fasting occasionally.    and at all events the white puddings
          will be irretreivably lost and 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name>out of imployment.
             our tar-kiln which ought to have began to run this morning has yealded no
          tar as yet and I am much affraid will not yeald any, if so I fear the whole opperation
          of my boat will be useless. I fear I have committed another blunder also in sewing the
          skins with a nedle which has sharp edges these have cut the skin and as it drys I
          discover that the throng dose not fill the holes as I expected tho' I made them sew with
          a large throng for that purpose.    at 10 OCk A. M. we had a slight shower
          which scarcely wet the grass. One buffaloe only and 2 Antelopes killed today six beaver
          and 2 otter have been killed within the last three days. The current of the river looks
          so gentle and inviting that the men all seem anxious to be moving upward as well as
          ourselves.    we have got the boat prety well forward today and think we shall
          be able to complete her tomorrow except 
          <ref target="n16070302" n="2">paying her,</ref>to do which will require some little time
          to make her first perfectly dry.    she has assumed her shape and looks
          extreemly well. She will be very light, more so than any vessel of her size that I ever
          saw.</p>

          as we have yet explored.    but few trees on the Std Side the grass is high
          and fine near the river.    the winds has blown for Several days from the S.
          W. I think it possible that those almost perpetial S W. winds, proceed from the agency
          of the 
          <name type="place" key="Lewis (Snowy) Range">Snowey mountains</name>and the wide leavel
          and untimbered plains which Streach themselves along their borders for an emence
          distance, that the air comeing in Contact with the Snow is Suddenly chilled and
          condensed, thus becomeing heavyer than the air beneath in the plains    it
          glides down the Sides of those mountains and decends to the plains, where by the
          constant action of the Sun on the face of the untimbered country there is a partial
          vacuom formed for it's reception    I have observed that the winds from this
          quarter is always the Coaldest and most violent which we experience, yet I am far from
          giveing full credit to this hypothesis on this Subject; if I find however on the opposit
          Side of these mountains that the winds take a contrary direction I Shall then have full
          faith.

          the boat, that I had not visited

          therefore set out with one of the men to day for that purpose. I found the 2nd pitch the
          most beautiful, though not the highest.
