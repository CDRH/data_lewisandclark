               <p>a fine day; the blacksmith again commences his opperations.    we were
          visited by but few of the natives today.    the situation of our boat and
          perogues is now allarming, they are firmly inclosed in the Ice and almost covered with
          snow. The ice which incloses them lyes in several stratas of unequal thicknesses which
          are seperated by streams of water.    this peculiarly unfortunate because so
          soon as we cut through the first strata of ice the water rushes up and rises as high as
          the upper surface of the ice and thus creates such a debth of water as 〈had〉 renders it
          impracticable to cut away the lower strata which appears firmly attatched to, and
          confining the bottom of the vessels.    the instruments we have hitherto used
          has been the ax only, with which, we have made several attempts that proved
          unsuccessfull from the cause above mentioned.    we then determined to attempt
          freeing them from the ice by means of boiling water which we purposed heating in the
          vessels by means of hot stones, but this expedient proved also fruitless, as every
          species of stone which we could procure in the neighbourhood partook so much of the
          calcarious genus
          <ref target="n09020302" n="2"/>that they burst into small particles on being exposed to
          the heat of the fire.    we now determined as the dernier resort to prepare a
          parsel of Iron spikes and attatch them to the end of small poles of convenient length
          and endeavour by means of them to free the vessels from the ice.    we have
          already prepared a large rope of Elk-skin and a windless by means of which we have no
          doubt of being able to draw the boat on the bank provided we can free from the ice.—</p>
