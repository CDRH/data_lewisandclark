               <p>Some intervales of fair weather last night, rain and wind Continue this morning, as

          course of the winds. I walked to the top of the first part of the mountain with much
          fatigue as the distance was about 3 miles thro' intolerable thickets of Small Pine,
          arrow wood a groth much resembling arrow wood with briers,

          drawing my Self up in many places by the bowers, the Countrey Continues thick and hilley
          as far back a I could See. Some Elk Sign, rained all day moderately. I am wet &amp;c.
          &amp;c. The Hail which fell 2 night past is yet to be Seen on the mountain on which I
          was to day. I Saw a Small red Berry which grows on a Stem of about 6 or 8 Inches from
          the Ground, in bunches and in great quantity on the Mountains, the taste insiped.
          <ref target="n25111303" n="3"/>I saw a number of verry large Spruce Pine one of which I
          measured 14 feet around and verry tall. My principal objects in assdg. this mountain was
          〈not〉 to view the river below, the weather being So Cloudey &amp; thick that I could not
          See any distance down, discovered the wind high from the N. W. and waves high at a Short

          the branch on which we are encamped    our canoe and the three men did not
          return this evening—    if we were to have cold weather to accompany the rain

          arrow wood on the Stem of which there is thorns; this groth about 12 or 15 feet high

          to this the hills were So Steep that I was compelled to draw my Self up by the

            <note xml:id="n25111301" n="1">Sitka spruce, as noted on November 4; it is the dominant
        species of this region. The Sitka spruce vegetation zone is a narrow coastal temperate
        rain forest, generally only a few miles in width except where it extends up river valleys.
        It has a uniform wet and mild climate with rich soils. The forests are dense, tall, and
        among the most productive in the world. The three most common trees are Sitka spruce,
        western hemlock, 
        <hi rend="italic">Tsuga heterophylla</hi>(Raf.) Sarg., and western redcedar. Douglas fir
        and grand fir are also important. The mature forests have lush understories with dense
        growth of shrubs, herbs, ferns, and mosses. Hitchcock et al., 1:132–33; Franklin &amp;

        of these problems. Thwaites (LC), 3:221 n. 1; Cutright (LCPN), 266; Gibbs (AVC), 11; Ray
