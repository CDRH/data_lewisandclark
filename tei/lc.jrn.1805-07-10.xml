                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>set out with his party early
          this morning and passed over to the opposite side.    after which I dispatched
          
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>with 4 Canoes and 
          <ref target="n16071001" n="1">8 men</ref>to take up a load of baggage as far as 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name>camp and return for the
          remainder of our plunder.    with 
          <ref target="n16071002" n="2">six others</ref>I now set to work on my boat, which had
          been previously drawn out of the water before the men departed, and in two hours had her
          fraim in readiness to be deposited.    had a cash dug and deposited the Fraim
          of the boat, some papers and a few other trivial articles of but little importance.
             the wind blew very hard the greater part of the day. I also had the truck
          wheels buried in the pit which had been made to hold the tar.    having
          nothing further to do I amused myself in fishing and caught a few small fish; they were
          of the species of white chub mentioned below 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>, tho' they
          are small and few in number. I had thought on my first arrival here that there were no
          fish in this part of the river. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>proceeded up the river 8
          miles by land (distance by water 23¼)
          <ref target="n16071003" n="3"/>and found 2 trees of Cottonwood and cut them down; one
          proved to be hollow and split in falling at the upper part and was somewhat windshaken
          at bottom; the other proved to be much windshaken.    he surched the bottom
          for better but could not find any he therefore determined to make canoes of those which
          he had fallen; and to contract their length in such manner as to clear the craks and the
          worst of the windsken parts making up the deficiency by allowing them to be as wide as
          the trees would permit.    they were much at a loss for wood to make
          axhandles.    the Chokecherry is the best we can procure for this purpose and
          of that wood they made and broke thir 13 handles in the course of this part of a day.
             had the eyes of our axes been round they would have answered this country
          much better.    the musquetoes were very troublesome to them as well as
          ourselves today. 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>proceeded up the river about
          5 miles when the wind became so violent that he was obliged to ly by untill late in the
          evening when he again set out with the canoes and arrived within 3 miles of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name>Camp where he halted for
          the night.    about five miles above 
          <name type="place" key="Upper portage camp (Mont.)">whitebear camp</name>there are two
          Islands [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: Qu</hi>] in the river covered with Cottonwood box alder and some
          sweet willow also the undergrowth like that of the islands at this place.—</p>

          much win Shaken, we Serched the bottoms for better trees and made a trial of Several

          trees we had fallen, to Contract thir length so as to clear the hollow &amp; winshakes,
          &amp; ad to the width as much as the tree would allow. The Musquitors emencely noumerous
          &amp; troublesom, Killed two deer &amp; a goat. The Canoes did not arrive as I expected,
          owing to the hard wind which blew a head in maney places.    we ar much at a

          round by water.
          <ref target="n16071006" n="6"/>   we proceeded on with the canoes 5 or 6
          miles    then the wind arose So high that we were obledged to lay by untill

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>thought it would be best
          to make two canoes more, if we could get timber large enough. So 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>and 10 men set out in
          search of it.
          <ref target="n16071008" n="8"/>Some of the hunters having seen large timber about 20
          miles up the river, the canoes were sent on loaded, and a party went by land; the
          distance that way being only 6 or 7 miles. If timber is found the canoes are to unload
          and return for the remainder of the baggage. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, myself and nine men
          staid to take the boat asunder and bury her; and deposited her safely under ground. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>had an observation at 12
          which gave 47° 3 10 N. Latitude. In the afternoon I went out to see if there were any
          buffaloe near, but found none: they appear to have all left the river. On the bank of a
          run where there are high rocks, I found a great quantity of sweet gooseberries, all
          ripe.</p>
