               <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> records that <name type="person" key="Howard, Thomas P.">Howard</name> was tried the next day (<ref n="1805-02-10" type="related">February 10</ref>) for "Setting Such a pernicious example to the Savages." If any hostility developed with the local Indians, the knowledge that the walls were so easily scaled would be dangerous. <name type="person" key="Howard, Thomas P.">Howard</name> was found guilty and sentenced to fifty lashes, but the court recommended mercy and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name> forgave him the punishment. For some reason the trial was not recorded in detachment orders. As far as the record goes, this was the last serious disciplinary problem of the expedition, or at least the last meriting trial by court-martial.</note>
