               <p>The day proved fair and favourable for our purposes.    the men were all
          engaged dressing skins and making themselves cloathes except

          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>whom I sent this morning over
          the river with orders to proceed to the entrance of the

          surch of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>and to hunt and kill Elk or
          buffaloe should they find any convenient to the river.    in the evening these
          men returned and informed me that they saw no appearance of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>or party.    they
          found no game nor was there a buffaloe to be seen in the plains as far as the eye could
          reach.    nothing remarkable took place in the course of the day.

             I fear some missfortune has happened them for their previous fidelity and
          orderly deportment induces me to beleive that they would not thus intentionally delay.

          reparing.    we have no pitch and will therefore be compelled to use coal and
          tallow.</p>

               <p>a heavy dew this morning.    loaded the Canoes and proceeded on down about

          evening, they had killed five deer two of which were in good order which they brought
          in.    here I took brackfast and proceeded on a fiew miles and I walked on
          Shore across a point of near 10 miles in extent in this bottom which was mostly open I
          saw Some fiew deer and Elk. I killed 3 of the deer which were Meagure the Elk appeared
          fat. I did not kill any of them as the distance to the river was too great for the men
          to Carry the meat    at the lower part of this bottom a large Creek of runnig
          water 25 yds wide
          <ref target="n37080903" n="3"/>falls in which meanders through an open roleing plain of
          great extent.    in the low bottoms of this Creek I observed Some timber Such
          as Cottonwood, ash &amp; Elm.    on my arival at the lower part of the bottom
          found that the canoes had been in waiting for me nearly two hours. The

          and walked in a Grove of timber where I met with an Elk which I killed.   
          this Elk was the largest Buck I ever Saw and the fattest animal which have been killed
          on the rout. I had the flesh and fat of this Elk brought to Camp
          <ref target="n37080906" n="6"/>and cut thin ready to dry.    the hunters
          killed nothing this evening.</p>
