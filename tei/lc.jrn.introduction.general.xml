            <p>The roots of the expedition of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>were already lengthy by the
        time of the Louisiana Purchase in April 1803. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson's</name>curiosity about the
        West was lifelong, sustained by his broad scientific interests and his hopes and dreams
        for the future of the United States. For at least twenty years before he launched 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>across two thousand miles into
        immortality, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had planned for a
        transcontinental expedition starting up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>. In 1783, while serving in
        Congress, he asked the frontier Revolutionary War hero 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, George Rogers">George Rogers Clark</name>(the older
        brother of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William</name>) to consider leading a privately
        sponsored expedition to explore the West. Then, as later, he feared that 
        <name type="place" key="Britain">Britain</name>might secure a foothold west of the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>(then the western boundary of
        the United States) and forestall American expansion. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, George Rogers">George Rogers Clark</name>declined the
        offer.
        <ref target="ngi000001" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>A few years later, while minister to 
        <name type="place" key="France">France</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>encouraged the hopes of 
        <name type="person" key="Ledyard, John">John Ledyard</name>, an American veteran of 
        <name type="person" key="Cook, James">Captain James Cook's</name>third voyage to the
        Pacific. 
        <name type="person" key="Ledyard, John">Ledyard</name>planned to travel eastward across 
        <name type="place" key="Siberia">Siberia</name>, secure passage on a ship to some point on
        the western coast of North America, and then strike out alone across the continent. It was
        a far-fetched project at best, and the suspicious Russians frustrated it by expelling 
        <name type="person" key="Ledyard, John">Ledyard</name>from their country.
        <ref target="ngi000002" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>In 1792 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, then secretary of state
        under 
        <name type="person" key="Washington, George">Washington</name>, and various friends and
        associates in the American Philosophical Society in 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>tried to interest 
        <name type="person" key="Marshall, Moses">Dr. Moses Marshall</name>, a physician and
        botanist from 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>, in undertaking an
        expedition up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. They offered a reward of a
        thousand guineas to 
        <name type="person" key="Marshall, Moses">Marshall</name>if he could provide proof of
        having reached the "South Sea," but apparently nothing came of the suggestion.
        <ref target="ngi000003" n="3"/>
            </p>
            <p>The following year, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>sponsored a more promising
        effort by 
        <name type="person" key="Michaux, André">André Michaux</name>, a French botanist. Acting
        for the American Philosophical Society, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>sent 
        <name type="person" key="Michaux, André">Michaux</name>west to "find the shortest &amp;
        most convenient route of communication between the U. S. &amp; the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific ocean</name>, within the temperate
        latitudes, &amp; to learn such particulars as can be obtained of the country through which
        it passes, it's productions, inhabitants &amp; other interesting circumstances." Avoiding
        Spanish authorities who might try to stop him, 
        <name type="place" key="Michaux, André">Michaux</name>was to ascend the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and, from its headwaters, locate
        the easiest route to some major stream flowing into the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>. Here already was the basic outline
        of the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>exploration. To appreciate how
        ambitious the scheme was it must be remembered that most of the territory 
        <name type="person" key="Michaux, André">Michaux</name>was to traverse and the people who
        inhabited it were either little known or wholly unknown to Europeans. Moreover, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had every reason to believe
        that the Spanish government, which claimed jurisdiction over 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>, would be hostile to the project. Only
        ten years later 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>could provide 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>with far more information about the
        lower 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Coast">Pacific Coast</name>than he was able to give 
        <name type="place" key="Michaux, André">Michaux</name>. In any event, 
        <name type="place" key="Michaux, André">Michaux</name>became involved in international
        intrigues and never crossed the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>.
        <ref target="ngi000004" n="4"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>made no further serious
        attempt to promote the exploration of the trans-
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>West until he became
        president in 1801; then, circumstances made the project seem not only feasible but also
        vitally necessary. As president, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>was in a better position to
        launch such an expedition and to insure adequate financing; in the same year, world
        political conditions seemed, more than ever, to threaten the preemption of the West by
        some other nation.</p>
            <p>By the time 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>entered the 
        <name type="place" key="White House">White House</name>, there had been several
        significant advances in knowledge of the country beyond the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>. In 1792, the American
        sea-going trader 
        <name type="person" key="Gray, Robert">Captain Robert Gray</name>had discovered and named
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>. In the same year, 
        <name type="person" key="Vancouver, George">Captain George Vancouver</name>of the British
        Navy had made a thorough survey of the northwest coast, sending one of his officers about
        one hundred miles up the great river. In the same decade, fur traders from 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, acting under the authority of
        the Spanish government, moved up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>as far as the villages of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>in present 
        <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Evans, John Thomas">John Thomas Evans</name>, who reached the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>in 1796, received
        instructions from his employer, 
        <name type="person" key="Mackay, James">James Mackay</name>, that seem to anticipate 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>instructions to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Evans, John Thomas">Evans</name>was asked to ascend the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>to its headwaters, inquire of the
        Indians about a river flowing "toward the setting sun," and descend this stream to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>. Along the way he was to collect
        specimens of animals and plants and to be "very accurate in his observations concerning
        the nations." 
        <name type="person" key="Evans, John Thomas">Evans</name>in fact got no farther than the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, where he found British
        traders extending their commercial network from 
        <name type="place" key="Canada">Canada</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Evans, John Thomas">Evans's</name>detailed maps of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>from present northeast 
        <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages were eventually of
        great assistance to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.
        <ref target="ngi000005" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <p>The catalyst, however, of 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>decision to launch the
        expedition was apparently the publication of 
        <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Alexander Mackenzie's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Voyages from 
        <name type="place" key="Montreal">Montreal</name>… through the Continent of North America,
        to the Frozen and 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Oceans</name>
               </hi>(
        <name type="place" key="London">London</name>, 1801); therein 
        <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Mackenzie</name>, a partner in the North
        West Company of 
        <name type="place" key="Canada">Canada</name>, described his 1789 trip to the 
        <name type="place" key="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</name>and his 1792–93 journey across
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</name>to the coast of present 
        <name type="place" key="British Columbia">British Columbia</name>. He had made the first
        crossing of the continent north of 
        <name type="place" key="Mexico">Mexico</name>and had discovered what he took to be the
        upper reaches of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. Having proved that such a
        crossing was possible, he urged in his book that Britain develop the transcontinental
        route, in order to secure the fur trade and open commerce with Asia. Here again was the
        danger that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had long feared—British
        preemption of the far West.
        <ref target="ngi000006" n="6"/>
            </p>
            <p>Many historians have seen 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>appointment of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>as his private
        secretary in 1801 as evidence that he intended from the first to send the young man on a
        western expedition, especially since 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>knowledge of the "western
        country" was a factor in 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>choice. Historian Donald
        Jackson argues that there is no proof of such an intention and suggests that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>may have wished to make use of
        
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>knowledge of the army to weed
        out officers with Federalist leanings. Although 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had stated the contrary, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>frontier experience, especially
        with Indians, was meager. One should not forget, however, that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had volunteered in 1793 for the
        expedition for which 
        <name type="person" key="Michaux, André">Michaux</name>was actually chosen and that in
        1805 he would write of the transcontinental exploration as "a darling project of mine for
        the last ten years."
        <ref target="ngi000007" n="7"/>
            </p>
            <p>In any case, it was 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>now selected to lead the
        enterprise on which he had definitely determined by the end of 1802. Born in 
        <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>in 1774, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had served as an army officer in
        the Northwest Territory for several years and had some experience with wilderness travel.
        His formal education was slight by present standards, but he was well read and had the
        scientific interests that characterized so many of 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>friends. What 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>really wanted was "a person
        who to courage, prudence, habits &amp; health adapted to the woods, &amp; some familiarity
        with the Indian character, joins a perfect knoledge of botany, natural history, mineralogy
        &amp; astronomy." His knowledge of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and his acquaintance with the
        American scientific community told him that Lewis was as close to such a paragon as he
        could realistically hope to find.

            </p>
            <p>The Louisiana Purchase did not prompt the expedition to explore west of the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>; 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was already on his way across the 
        <name type="place" key="Appalachian Mountains">Appalachians</name>in the summer of 1803
        when 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>sent him definite word of the
        diplomatic windfall that had occurred in 
        <name type="place" key="Paris">Paris</name>the previous April. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>hopes had always pointed
        toward eventual American penetration of the lands beyond the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>, but the French decision to
        sell this vast territory presented the United States with an opportunity of which the
        president could only have dreamed for the distant future. Now an expedition became all the
        more important as an inspection and an assertion of sovereignty over the new empire.

            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>agreed that there must be a
        second-in-command competent to carry on if something were to happen to the commander; 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>choice was his old army friend 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>. Four years older than 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, he had also served several years
        in the army on the frontier and had been 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>immediate superior for a time.
        After resigning his captain's commission in 1796, he had engaged in family business in

        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>quite adequately demonstrated his
        mastery of wilderness craft on his great journey, and the expedition did not suffer as a
        result of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>"hypochondriac affections,"
        which even

        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was not altogether a model in
        those respects, in spite of his more elegant literary style. Both were largely
        self-educated by today's standards.

               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>conception of the expedition
        encompassed far more than geographic discovery, important as that was. It would be
        arbitrary to distinguish between his "practical" and "scientific" goals, for 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, a true son of the
        Enlightenment, believed all knowledge to be of some benefit. He characterized the
        enterprise as "purely literary"—devoted to gathering and disseminating scientific
        knowledge—in sounding out the Spanish minister on his government's possible reaction to
        the expedition; the minister was understandably skeptical. After the Louisiana Purchase,
        of course, the practical aspect of the expedition became more immediately relevant.

               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>final instructions of June
        1803, formidable in their scope even to the modern reader, reflect the broad range of
        interests of the third president. In a day of less rigid academic specialization when the
        distinction between professional and amateur was not fixed, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>could be not only a political
        leader but president of the American Philosophical Society, then the principal group
        promoting scientific endeavor in the United States. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>himself was perhaps the
        nation's leading expert on the geography of the trans-
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>West, and geographic
        discovery was, of course, one of his principal purposes for the expedition. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>made the last search up the

               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had much more in mind,
        however. The captains were to open a highway for the American fur trade, to win over the
        Indians from Spanish or British influence, and to lay the foundation for what 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>hoped would be a carefully
        regulated trade and intercourse with the Indians that would avoid some of the evils of
        unrestrained competition and interracial conflict so common in American experience.
        Further, they were to observe and record the whole range of natural history and ethnology
        of the area and the possible resources for future settlers. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>expected a great deal of two

        were ready to begin the great adventure.</p>
            <p>Any government enterprise of comparable importance in the twentieth century would have
        a planning staff bigger than the Corps of Discovery of forty-odd men who set out from 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River Dubois</name>on May 14, 1804. The planning

        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, with advice from 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>friends in the American
        scientific community. Up to the date of setting out, it was essentially 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>expedition; after that date,
        the captains were on their own. They faithfully carried out

            <p>For the first stage of the journey, as far as the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages, they followed the
        footsteps of others. There were maps of the route, however sketchy, and the Indians had
        had some acquaintance with traders. In this period the captains devoted much time to
        informing the Indians of the change of sovereignty, to insuring as much as possible that
        the Indians transferred their nominal allegiance, and to alleviating intertribal
        conflicts. The journey was marred in this period by some disciplinary problems, by the

        <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>; the wait for the

        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>headwaters. In April 1805, they

               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>last entry is a reminder that
        "wrighting &amp;c." was one of the principal tasks of the captains, and one that they
        thoroughly fulfilled. As Donald Jackson has observed, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were "the writingest explorers of

        illegibly, and always with an urgent sense of purpose."
        <ref target="ngi000023" n="23"/>They left us a remarkably full record of their
        enterprise, but questions about that record remain unanswered. One of the most vexing
        problems of the journals, as such, concerns a question whose answer might appear quite
        obvious: when and how were the journals written? The immediate and natural supposition of
        any reader is that the entries were written day by day on the dates placed at their heads
        by the authors. Examination of the journals now available, however, discredits that
        expectation. The existence of duplicate journals, mainly by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, for certain periods of the
        expedition, and internal evidence indicating that many entries cannot have been written on
        the days they cover, require greater consideration of the journal-keeping methods of the
        captains.</p>

        collaboration with

        the expedition, probably had more information about the two captains' methods of keeping a
        journal than anyone else who was not with the expedition, but he did not reveal it to his
        readers. By the time anyone again examined the journals at length, the authors were no
        longer available to provide what were no doubt simple explanations of many mysteries and
        apparent inconsistencies. When Elliott Coues examined the notebooks in the American
        Philosophical Society archives in 1892–93, he was struck by their good condition and
        concluded that the predominant red morocco-bound books, at least, could not have crossed
        the continent: "The covers are too fresh and bright, the paper too clean and sound. . . .
        The handwritings are too good, and too uniform. . . . The red books were certainly written
        after the return of the Expedition, and before 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>death in October, 1809—that is,
        in 1806–9."
        <ref target="ngi000024" n="24"/>
            </p>
            <p>In opposition to Coues's belief that the journals might have been written, in part, as
        late as 1809 is 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>statement that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>turned the notebooks over to him
        "on his return"—that is, on or soon after 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>on December 28, 1806. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>understanding was that they
        had been written day by day, and that each notebook was sealed in a tin box when finished
        to protect it from the elements. Even assuming that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>learned the exact procedure
        the captains followed, his description, written from memory nine years later, might not be
        precisely correct. However, he was hardly likely to have gained the impression that the
        volumes he specifically called "travelling pocket journals" were written on the trip if
        they were blank when he first saw them on 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>return. Nothing could have kept
        the president from poring over them, as he apparently did those sent back from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in 1805. His words
        strongly imply that the notebook journals were more or less complete by the time of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>.
        <ref target="ngi000025" n="25"/>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, Coues never imagined that the captains wrote their journals from memory in
        the years after their homecoming. The red books he viewed at the American Philosophical
        Society did not include some other notebooks there that have different bindings; their
        condition convinced him that those could have been on the expedition, and he thought that
        true of some but not all the small, fragmentary items of a few sheets each that he
        examined. Those last he thought likely to be the remains of field journals made on the
        spot, day by day, their information later being transferred into the notebooks.
        <ref target="ngi000026" n="26"/>
            </p>
            <p>When Reuben Gold Thwaites examined additional materials that he discovered a few years
        later, he found among them 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Elkskin-bound Journal, as he called
        it, covering the same period as some of the red books. This new volume, written on letter
        paper later sewn together and bound, undoubtedly in the field, seemed to fit exactly the
        description of field notes, later copied and expanded in the notebook journals. The
        Elkskin-bound Journal and some other new fragments made Thwaites confident that he
        understood the captains' basic procedures: 
        <quote rend="indented">It was the daily custom of the captains to make rough notes, with
        rude outline maps, plans, and miscellaneous sketches, in field-books which they doubtless
        carried in their pockets. When encamped for a protracted period, these were developed into
        more formal records. In this development, each often borrowed freely from the other's
        notes—
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, the better scholar of the two
        generally rewriting in his own manner the material obtained from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>; while the latter not infrequently
        copied 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>practically verbatim, but with his
        own phonetic spelling. Upon returning to 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, these individual journals were
        for the most part transcribed into neat blank books—bound in red morocco and
        gilt-edged—with the thought of preparing them for early publication. After this process,
        the original field-books must have been cast aside and in large measure destroyed; for but
        one of these [
        <hi rend="italic">the Elkskin-bound Journal</hi>] is now known to exist. There have come
        down to us, however, several note-books which apparently were written up in the camps.
        <ref target="ngi000027" n="27"/>
               </quote>Thwaites did not attempt to say just when the
        field books were made, nor why some field notes and journals, notably the Elkskin-bound
        Journal, were preserved when so many others were "in large measure destroyed."</p>
            <p>Thwaites's explanation is broadly plausible, but again we confront 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>statement that the red books
        turned over to him at the beginning of 1807 were written on the trip. If 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>was mistaken on this point,
        then Thwaites's theory requires the captains to have written the entire body of red
        notebook journals—fourteen notebooks containing several hundred thousand words—between the
        arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>on September 23, 1806, and late
        December 1806. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>last journal entry (September 26,
        1806), apparently written in 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, says that "we commenced
        wrighting &amp;c," but as noted, there is no indication of what they were writing.</p>
            <p>Following Thwaites's theory, the red books had to have been written in the course of
        some three months or a little more, during which the captains were traveling; visiting
        relatives; seeing to other business; and attending public ceremonies, welcoming
        celebrations, and banquets. During that period 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was also escorting the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>chief 
        <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Big White</name>(
        <name type="person" key="Big White (Sheheke)">Sheheke</name>) to the capital. Moreover,
        substantial parts of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journals for the last part of the
        expedition are evidently copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>. On the journey to 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>the captains separated in
        mid-November and did not reunite until January 21, 1807, when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>reached 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>. Unless 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>left a great part of his journals
        with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, which seems most unlikely, the
        period during which the journal writing could have been done narrows to a period of less
        than two months after the expedition's arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>. If we add the fact that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>next to last notebook journal has a
        lengthy passage in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>hand, inserted in the middle
        with no apparent gaps in the writing, the theory that the red books were wholly the
        product of the period after the return to 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>seems questionable.</p>
            <p>There are other good reasons for doubting the postexpedition theory of composition.
        Eighteen red books are known, all having some connection with the expedition, though it is
        not known when the captains obtained them. One of them is Codex O, as labeled by Coues,
        which contains Lewis's astronomical observations for the first year of the expedition and
        his summary of creeks and rivers. It is generally believed that this book was among the
        materials sent back from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in April 1805; it has no
        data collected after that time. If so, then the captains had it with them from the start,
        and in all probability they had all eighteen identical books from the beginning, wherever
        they were purchased. No one can possibly imagine that they carried eighteen notebooks to
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>and back without having intended from
        the first to write in them along the way.</p>
            <p>There is no specific reference to the red books in any of the preexpedition lists of
        supplies. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>listed "Books" and "Writing paper"
        among his requirements for the trip, and since he did not specify titles, the books may
        well mean notebooks. He drew "8 Rect. books" from the U.S. arsenal in 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>and purchased six packing
        boxes for "Stationary &amp;c." there, in the spring of 1803. An undated memorandum in
        Codex C, in an unknown hand, lists goods packed for the expedition at some point. The list
        includes four bales of goods, each containing "2 tin Boxes, with 2 mem. Books in Ea."; a
        recapitulation of the same goods in the memorandum gives "8 tin Boxes with memm. Books".
        This gives sixteen books. Among 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>personal effects inventoried
        after his death in 1809 were "Sixteen Note books bound in red morocco with clasps." The
        coincidence in number is striking; it would indeed be conclusive, except that there are
        eighteen red books extant, all having some connection with the expedition. There is no
        really satisfactory way to account for the two extra books. Since there is no certainty
        when the memorandum in Codex C was written, we cannot say which red books might have been
        in use and so not listed among those packed. For instance, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>used Codex O for his astronomical
        observations from the beginning of the expedition. If the Codex C list was made up just
        before setting out from 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">Wood River</name>, Codex O might not have been
        packed away in a relatively inaccessible box in a bale but could have been with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>or easily available.</p>
            <p>It is, of course, entirely possible that the captains purchased two more identical
        books after the expedition, and it would be exceedingly difficult to say which of those
        now known would be the extra two, since all eighteen red notebooks contain or apparently
        did once contain material that could have been written during the expedition. Neither is
        there any clear indication of which two red books 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>would not have included among the
        expeditionary materials he had with him on his last journey in 1809. The captains'
        practice of taking pages from one notebook and inserting them in another makes it
        impossible to be certain what material (particularly the fragmentary 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>items) may have been in what book
        at the time of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>death, or at any other time

               <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>says the books were "cemented"
        up in tin boxes for protection when completed, but that they had been removed from the
        boxes before 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>delivered them to him. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>or 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>must therefore have told him those
        details, which implies that they gave him some information about their methods of journal
        keeping. The captains could have kept the notebooks in boxes sealed in some manner to keep
        out moisture, taking them out for writing in relatively sheltered camps or when the
        weather was good, while rough field notes served for daily entries under less favorable
        conditions.</p>
            <p>Writing in 1807, 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">David McKeehan</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass's</name>editor, sought to establish
        the reliability of 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>work by stating, "At the different
        resting places during the expedition, the several journals were brought together,
        compared, corrected, and the blanks which had been unavoidably left, filled up."
        <ref target="ngi000029" n="29"/>This information, vague and unspecific as it is, could
        only have come from 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>; the journals referred to could be
        field notes or notebook journals, or both. Certainly such resting places would have been
        the points at which the notebook journals were brought up to date, if they were not, in
        fact, the journals in which the entries were kept day by day.</p>
            <p>The discovery in 1953 of rough, unbound notes by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, covering, besides the period at 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)">Camp Dubois</name>,
        the first eleven months of the expedition—the same period as 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>first three notebooks—complicates
        as much as it clarifies. One can easily believe that these scribbled, interlined entries,
        written on miscellaneous sizes of loose paper, often over sketch maps, arithmetical
        calculations, and addresses on used envelopes, were first-draft notes taken in the field
        on the journey up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. It is then easy to imagine 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>copying and expanding on them in the
        notebooks whenever time allowed, even as late as the winter at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. Once they reached 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, however, the Field
        Notes become increasingly skimpy, with gaps sometimes weeks in length. For this period we
        must either imagine another full set of field notes, whose existence is both unproven and
        unnecessary, or suppose that in this period 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote his entries daily into a bound
        journal.
        <ref target="ngi000030" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>There is, however, material in the notebooks that is not in the Field Notes, indicating
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote into them when events were
        fairly fresh in his mind. In his Codex A entry for July 4, 1804, we find reflections on
        the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Kansa Indians">Kansa Indians</name>not in the Field Notes.
        On the other hand, in the Codex A entry for July 23, 1804, he names 
        <name type="place" key="Camp White Catfish (Iowa)">Camp White Catfish</name>, although the
        fish for which the camp was named was not caught until the next day. Thus we must assume
        that the codex entry was written on or after July 24, or that he wrote the entry on the
        twenty-third, inserting the name of the camp later—which from the appearance of the page
        is entirely possible.</p>
            <p>In the Field Notes for August 20, 1804, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>records in the present tense that 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd</name>was seriously ill,
        then writes of 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd's</name>death. In Codex B for the same day,
        
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>repeats the description of 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd's</name>illness and death. One must suppose
        either that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote both the Field Notes and Codex
        B simultaneously, with considerable difference in wording, or that he wrote the codex
        entry later, without taking into account his knowledge that 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>had died. This journalistic
        convention persists throughout the journals and, of course, complicates the problem of
        determining the time of writing of particular entries. In any case, in the notebook entry
        of August 20, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>refers to 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>as "our Decesed brother," a phrase
        not found in the Field Notes—perhaps evidence that he wrote the notebook entry when the
        emotion was still fairly fresh.</p>
            <p>On October 13, 1804, a court-martial of party members tried 
        <name type="person" key="Newman, John">Private John Newman</name>for "mutinous
        expression." 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>brief record of the episode in his
        Codex C entry for October 13 says that 
        <name type="person" key="Newman, John">Newman</name>was tried "last night." Apparently he
        wrote the codex entry the day after the trial. The paragraph on the trial, comes at the
        very end of the entry, so it is likely that the whole entry was composed on October 14,
        the day after its ostensible date. This is at a time when the Field Notes entries are
        still continuous and fairly extensive; the Codex C entry, however, includes much
        information not found in the Field Notes, apparently taken down by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>at the time he received it. At this
        time he was obviously copying and expanding his first notes into the notebook journal
        quite promptly.</p>
            <p>During the 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>winter, when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>notebook entries are quite full,
        entries in the Field Notes for widely separated dates follow one another without any
        evidence of missing pages. In fact, a single sheet, document 64 of Ernest Osgood's
        arrangement of the Field Notes, contains the entries for the period from November 19,
        1804, to April 3, 1805; the entries follow one another with no indication of spaces for
        later insertion of material. Sheets in the Field Notes may have been lost, but it seems
        more likely that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote directly into his notebook
        journal. As further evidence, note that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>kept the bound book up to date
        when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was absent for ten days in February
        on a hunting trip; 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>then wrote a short summary of his
        excursion in the book on his return. From the appearance of the journal, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote this account immediately after
        his return, rather than inserting it later.</p>
            <p>It does not seem wise to postulate the writing of field notes by either captain in
        cases where none have been found and there is no strong evidence of their having existed.
        Theories involving the existence of such notes are to be avoided unless the evidence
        clearly requires them. The sheer amount of labor involved in composing multiple sets of
        notes and journals argues against such suppositions. Considering the history of journal
        discoveries to date, however, no one would wish to assert positively that there are no
        lost notes or journals, or that none will ever be found. Certainly there are cases where
        notebook journal entries were clearly written weeks or months after the given date, and
        then it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that the writer kept notes of some sort.</p>
            <p>The discovery of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes consisting of the
        Dubois and River Journals, and other discoveries at various times and places, may seem to
        support the possibility of other such field journals. But the Dubois Journals relate to
        the period before the expedition proper and were not the basis, as far as we know, for a
        duplicate set of notebook journals. Obviously 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>kept both field notes and notebook
        journals for the journey up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, but it does not
        necessarily follow that he used the same procedure throughout the expedition, especially
        since he apparently did not follow this method at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and his field notes fall
        off sharply after his arrival there.</p>
            <p>On April 7, 1805, the permanent party set out upriver from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>; at the same time, the
        keelboat carrying the discharged members of the party headed down river with a load of
        dispatches, papers, and specimens for delivery to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>. At this point we encounter
        more complex problems of journal-keeping procedures and missing notes.</p>
            <p>The first question concerns just what journal materials were sent to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>on the keelboat. At several
        points in the summer and fall the captains indicated that they intended to send back a
        pirogue with some of the soldiers and boatmen under 
        <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Corporal Richard Warfington</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>indicates more than once that they
        were preparing materials to be sent back with that party. As it happened, they did not
        dispatch the return party until the following spring, for reasons never stated. Both 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>wrote letters to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>indicating what they were
        sending, but neither was specific enough to spare us some puzzlement. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote on April 3, 1805, that he was
        sending the "notes which I have taken in the form of a journal in their original state,"
        apologizing because "many parts are incorrect." 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>wrote that they were sending the
        president "a part of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name>private journal, the other
        part you will find inclosed in a separate tin box. The journal is in it's original state,
        and of course incorrect, but it will give you the daily detales of our progress, and
        transactions." A great deal hinges on the meaning of the expressions "private journal" and
        "original state," and on how we interpret the two parts of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journal.
        <ref target="ngi000031" n="31"/>
            </p>
            <p>Various interpretations are possible. We could take 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes to be a "private"
        journal, and the notebook journals to be "public" or official; thus the Field Notes
        constitute one part and the notebook journals—Codices A, B, and C—the other. We might take
        the Dubois Journal and the River Journal, the two parts of the Field Notes, as the two
        parts meant, but there is no evidence that the Dubois Journal ever went to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, and the division into the
        Dubois Journal and the River journal is merely a modern convenience. The argument can be
        made that the two parts were parts of the River Journal itself, on the basis of a notation
        by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on document 56 of the Field Notes.
        One side contains journal entries for September 20–23, 1804. The other side bears an
        address:

        <ref target="ngi000032" n="32"/>
            </p>
            <p>On the same document under the September 23 entry 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote, "I must seal up all those
        scripts &amp; draw from my Journal at some other time."</p>
            <p>The address and the conclusion of entries on the same sheet seem to indicate that the
        captains still hoped to send a party back before winter, and that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>intended to send the Field Notes to
        his oldest brother 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, Jonathan">Jonathan</name>, to be kept until his return.
        They had kept 
        <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Warfington</name>with them past the end of
        his enlistment in August so that he could head the return party. We might suppose that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>made sure that his notebook journals
        were up-to-date at this point, since he could not use the Field Notes for this purpose
        after sending them back, and he may have brought the notebooks up-to-date similarly when
        they considered sending materials back from 
        <name type="place" key="Camp White Catfish (Iowa)">Camp White Catfish</name>in July. On
        the other hand, if the notebooks were not up-to-date, this could be the reason why the
        return party did not set out before winter. This might even be the reason why 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>neglected the Field Notes at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and apparently wrote
        directly into his notebook journal, the earlier procedure having proved too
        time-consuming.</p>
            <p>On document 58 of the Field Notes is a notation by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>: "A Continuation of notes taken
        assending the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missourie</name>in 1804—by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">W. Clark</name>." It may be, then, that the two
        parts of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>"private journal" are the two parts
        of the Field Notes— the part sealed up to be sent to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, Jonathan">Jonathan Clark</name>in September 1804, but not
        sent, and the notes taken after that time. The note about "A Continuation" could indicate
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>thought of the Field Notes as being
        in two parts.
        <ref target="ngi000033" n="33"/>
            </p>
            <p>Against the above interpretation, however, is another notation by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, written April 2, 1805, on document
        64 in the Field Notes, during preparations to send off the keelboat and its cargo from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>: 
        <quote rend="indented">I conclude to Send my journal to the President of the United States
        in its original State for his own perusial, untill I Call for it or Some friend if I
        Should not return, an this journal is from the 13th of May 1804 untill the 3rd of April
        1805.</quote>Here again is the phrase "in its original state," suggesting that the journal
        referred to is the same as mentioned in the captains' letters to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>as 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>"private journal." What journal was
        it?</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>says the journal began on May 13,
        1804, which cannot apply to the Field Notes, unless he was in error. The last document of
        the Dubois Journal ends on May 14, and the River Journal's first sheet begins with the
        same date. The first notebook journal, Codex A, however, does begin on May 13. The journal
        to be sent back, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>says, ends on April 3, 1805; that is
        true of the Field Notes and, in a sense, of the notebook journals. The April 3 entry in
        Codex C is followed by a list of items to be sent back on the keelboat, then the entries
        for April 4–7. Since the entry for April 3 in 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes shows that they
        expected to leave the next day, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>could well have thought of the April
        3 entry in Codex C as the last, adding a list of materials to be sent back for 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>information. Thus, when he
        wrote in the Field Notes on April 2 that the journal went to April 3, that could also have
        been the case with the notebook journals. Since they did not, in fact, leave until April
        7—due presumably to last-minute delays—it was natural for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to add entries for the extra days in
        Codex C.</p>
            <p>With such an indication that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>considered his notebook journals to
        be in their "original state," it seems reasonable that the two parts of his journal were
        the Field Notes and the notebook journals—Codices A, B, and C. That the notebook journals
        went to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>is clear from 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>letter to 
        <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Benjamin Smith Barton</name>in December
        1805, referring to the feeding of cottonwood bark to horses by the Indians in terms very
        similar to those in Codex C but not in the Field Notes.
        <ref target="ngi000034" n="34"/>It seems most likely that the Field Notes also went to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, though there is no specific
        evidence proving this. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did note in a letter from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>that he was sending
        "papers of considerable consequence" to his brother in 
        <name type="place" key="Louisville, Ky.">Louisville</name>, and the Field Notes would meet
        this description. It is likely, however, that those "papers" consisted of the Dubois
        Journal, not the River Journal. Document 65 bears the address of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, Jonathan">Jonathan Clark</name>and the notation "notes at 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">Wood River</name>in 1803–4." 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>certainly did not send those
        notes—which surely must be the Dubois Journal—to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, Jonathan">Jonathan</name>before the departure from 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>in 1804, for the other side of
        document 65 bears an entry for November 30, 1804, after they had reached 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. From its appearance,
        document 65 could have been the wrapper in which the 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">Wood River</name>notes (Dubois Journal) were sealed
        for shipment to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, Jonathan">Jonathan Clark</name>. If those notes were in a
        separate packet, it may have been because they were going to a different destination than
        the River Journal, sent to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>. That 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote a full entry for November 30 on
        document 65 may only mean that he thought of taking up regular keeping of the Field Notes
        after they had settled in at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, then abandoned the idea
        in favor of the notebook journals.
        <ref target="ngi000035" n="35"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journal-writing procedure, up to
        the departure from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, then, seems reasonably
        clear. On the upriver journey he kept daily field notes and copied and expanded them into
        his notebook journals as convenient, sometimes neglecting the Field Notes at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in favor of writing
        directly into Codex C. The daily continuity of the Field Notes ends with November 13,
        1804, the entries becoming increasingly irregular; document 64 covers the entire period
        from that date to April 3, 1805, and appears to be the last sheet of the Field Notes.
        During the building of 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in early November, the
        keeping of two journals may have seemed too much of a burden in the midst of other
        demanding work. If so, then Codex C was presumably up-to-date at that time, and perhaps
        Codices A and B were also. Codices B and C, however, overlap on October 1, 2, and 3, and
        the entries in Codex C for the first and second are skimpy in comparison to those in Codex
        B. Possibly 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>began writing in Codex C when Codex B
        was not yet up to date, on the first of October. The fuller entry for October 3 is in
        Codex C, and conceivably he had caught up and filled in Codex B by then.</p>
            <p>More difficult to explain is 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal-keeping procedure and
        particularly the large gaps in his writing, which raise the possibility of missing
        manuscripts. The largest gap, and the one most curious to historians, is the long hiatus
        from the start of the expedition in May 1804, until the group set out from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in April 1805. That gap
        is particularly bewildering because we would expect 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>to be more conscientious at the
        outset of the expedition, especially in light of 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>explicit instructions about
        the keeping of multiple journals.
        <ref target="ngi000036" n="36"/>So incredulous have some observers been at this gap that
        they have speculated that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was probably keeping either field
        drafts or standard journals of the party's activities that have since been lost.
        <ref target="ngi000037" n="37"/>
            </p>
            <p>To say that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>was keeping no journal from the
        outset is not precisely correct. There exist two small fragments, called Codices Aa and Ba
        by Coues, for the dates May 15 and 20, and September 16–17, 1804. Those sheets, apparently
        torn from one of the red books, suggest to some that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was keeping a journal for the
        initial period, and that the remaining pages were so soiled, ruined, or unnecessary that
        they were discarded. Or perhaps the remaining pages are simply lost. Another explanation
        seems plausible and is presented here as part of a larger conception of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal-keeping activities
        throughout the trip.</p>
            <p>In Codex Aa it is noteworthy that the order of days is reversed; the entry for May 20
        precedes the entry for May 15, with no break between the two. The entry for May 20
        recounts 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>activities for that day as he
        set out by land from 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>for 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Charles, Mo.">St. Charles</name>where he was to rendezvous
        with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, who was leading the party upriver.
        The entry also reports the activities of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party. Perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>saw this entry as the beginning of
        his journal keeping since the captains had determined to set out the next day (May 21).
        Then why the addition of notes for May 15? That is a more detailed report of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>trip upriver, written as if 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had been present. Information in
        that entry exceeds the notes taken by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>for that day in either of his two
        accounts (Field Notes and Codex A) and probably came directly from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>thought he ought to add an entry
        for May 15 after his May 20 entry to give a more detailed account of the actual start of
        the expedition. Although 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>set out from 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River Dubois</name>on May 14, the captains had
        earlier established May 15 as the date to begin, and perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>still had that date in mind.</p>
            <p>Codex Ba presents a different situation. On September 16 and 17, 1804, the group was
        encamped at 
        <name type="place" key="American (Corvus) Creek">"Corvus" Creek</name>just above today's 
        <name type="place" key="White River">White River</name>in 
        <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>(see 
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>map 21). There the captains made the decision not to send back
        the pirogue with artifacts and other items representing their journey thus far. Perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had thought that their notes to
        that point would return to 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>with the other materials and
        eventually reach 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>; thus, he may have
        considered that he was now beginning a journal, in a sense the first for him since he had
        apparently quit writing after his May 15 entry. Having made the decision not to send a
        boat and crew back, he may have ceased his journalizing (indeed, he stopped at midpage in
        midsentence) and perhaps delayed writing again until after the winter at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>.</p>
            <p>Even before those dates 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>may have established a pattern of
        laxness in journal writing. He began a diary (here called the Eastern Journal) when he
        left 
        <name type="place" key="Pittsburgh, Pa.">Pittsburgh</name>in August 1803, as he descended
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Ohio River">Ohio River</name>enroute to 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, but from September 19 to
        November 11, he made no entries. He left thirty-nine pages blank in the notebook between
        those separated entries, however, perhaps with the intention of supplying the missing
        information later, but that hiatus was never filled. About October 26, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>joined 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>at 
        <name type="place" key="Louisville, Ky.">Louisville</name>, but 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>did not turn over journal-keeping
        chores to his friend at that time. Had he done so, today we might have a more complete
        record of the remainder of the trip to 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)">Camp Dubois</name>,
        for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was a more consistent recorder than
        his companion. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>returned to journalizing on
        November 11 and gave the journal to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on November 28, near 
        <name type="place" key="Kaskaskia, Ill.">Kaskaskia</name>, as they separated while 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>went ahead by land to 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>brought the boat party forward to
        establish 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)">Camp Dubois</name>.
        From that point we have a nearly consistent record because of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>faithful journal keeping.

            <p>Those writing gaps of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>may be instances of a larger
        pattern of negligence. The gaps as a whole include the missing days from the Eastern
        Journal (September 19 to November 11, 1803); the lapse from May 14, 1804, to April 7, 1805
        (with the exceptions noted); only spotty entries from August 26, 1805; to January 1, 1806;
        and the final hiatus from August 12, 1806, to the completion of the expedition. The last
        gap can be explained by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>being partially disabled from a
        wound; in contrast to other stoppages, he noted that he was laying down his pen at that
        point. In all from May 1804, to September 1806, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>missed over four hundred days of
        journal entries.
        <ref target="ngi000039" n="39"/>
            </p>
            <p>Some authorities have supposed that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was keeping field notes during the
        period from 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)">Camp Dubois</name>to
        
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and intending to use that
        material to fill regular notebooks later, or that the fragments from a red book (the
        entries for May and September) were part of a complete set of notes that are now lost.
        Jackson has made the strongest case for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>having kept notes during the first
        leg of the journey, but he emphasizes the speculative nature of his conclusions. Briefly,
        Jackson believes that a mishap on May 14, 1805, may indicate a loss of journals. On that
        day one of the pirogues turned on its side and filled with water, and some of the papers
        and notebooks got wet. Jackson discovered that within a few days of the accident 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>began conscientiously to copy into
        his own journal 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>natural history notes, something
        he had not previously done. Jackson argues that the spoilages may have been greater than
        expected, convincing the captains that duplicating all records was necessary, not just
        keeping multiple diaries. He also conjectures that "perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>notes for the entire first leg
        of the expedition were either badly water-soaked or entirely lost." Thus, Jackson believes
        that the entries by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>for May and September 1804 may be
        fragments of a larger journal from that early period. Thwaites also thought that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was a regular journal-keeper, but
        his reasoning is less plausible than Jackson's. He supposed that the journals may have
        been lost after 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>death in 
        <name type="place" key="Tennessee">Tennessee</name>. However, we would expect that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>or 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>would have bemoaned such a
        loss at some time, but neither ever made reference to so serious a loss in any known
        source. Jackson's answer for a reason that there is no mention of the supposed loss of
        journals in May 1805 is that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>would tell 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>about the accident after his
        return but that there was no need to announce it to the world in his diary.

            <p>Jackson and others who think 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>kept a journal or field notes
        during the trip to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>have found strong
        evidence in letters of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>just before the party set out
        from that post. The opening phrase of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>letter has been struck out and
        other words substituted by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote, "As 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>has not Leasure to Send
        〈write〉 a correct Coppy journal of our proceedings &amp;c." and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>substituted, "It being the wish of
        
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>." There are several ways to
        read the excised parts: does 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>not have time to send his journal,
        has he not had time to write it, or has he not had time to make a correct copy? 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>letter stated that he would send
        a canoe with some men back from the extreme navigable point of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>(a scheme later rejected) and
        with that boat "I shal send you my journal." Again, one can read the phrase variously: is 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>to send a journal he has been
        keeping or one he intends to write? Rather than speculate on the hidden meaning of the
        letters, it is better to examine the totality of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal keeping and to interpret
        from that perspective.

            <p>Although extant daily entries by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>from 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Charles, Mo.">St. Charles</name>to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>are lacking, there exists
        quite a bit of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>writing from that period, and
        additional material is known to be missing. As the expedition's naturalist he kept fairly
        extensive notes on the flora and fauna of the region through which the party passed. In
        Codex R, he made a list of herbarium specimens that he was collecting. The descriptive
        writing is occasionally lengthy and shows not only 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>powers of observation but also
        his record-keeping activities. Observations of animals are almost as extensive and cover
        over fifty pages of Codex Q. The captain was also noting mineral deposits and geologic
        features along the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and taking astronomical
        observations—both time-consuming tasks that included record-keeping. And, although 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>cannot be credited directly, it is
        known that the captains were keeping lists of Indian vocabularies during this period, work
        that may have amounted to extensive note taking. The vocabularies are the missing material
        that might exhibit additional record keeping by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>.</p>
            <p>From January to May 1804, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was keeping a weather diary. Those
        observations are repeated in 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Codex C, and it seems probable that
        
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was copying 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>entries. After May 14 there is a
        gap of weather data in both captains' books until September 19; the notations are then
        resumed with hardly an interruption until April 3, 1805, when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>began placing weather data with
        the daily entries. The weather notes indicate a substantial amount of writing because they
        consist of two temperature readings for each day, the general state of the weather, the
        wind direction, and the rise and fall of the river. There are also comments on natural
        history including sightings of animals and the budding and fading of flora. It is
        uncertain whether 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>made the notes along the way or at
        
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, but it was a
        collaborative effort of the captains.

            </p>
            <p>Evidence that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>may have done more extensive
        writing exists in the form of a single loose sheet from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes (Osgood's document 35).
        The sheet is entirely in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>hand and contains on one side a
        draft for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>description of the 
        <name type="place" key="Platte River (Nebr.)">Platte River</name>, which he later
        transferred into Codex O as his survey of rivers and creeks. Although there is a date of
        July 21 (1804) on the document, the reverse contains lunar observations (also in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>hand) for February 23, 1805,
        while the party was at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. It could be that the
        draft describing the 
        <name type="place" key="Platte River (Nebr.)">Platte</name>was also written at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and there copied into
        Codex O. Because the draft from the Field Notes is an incomplete portion, it is certain
        that other pages are missing; whether they describe only the 
        <name type="place" key="Platte River (Nebr.)">Platte</name>or are a full draft of his
        summary may never be known. If 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was keeping thorough topographical
        notes throughout the first portion of the trip, it helps explain why no daily entry
        material has been found. It may simply have amounted to too much writing.</p>
            <p>Taken together, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>recording activities up to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>add up to a large amount
        of writing and may represent a proportional share of the writing duties of the captains.
        What emerges is a picture of the two men sharing journal-keeping chores, though not
        following 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>prescription to the letter.
        It is difficult to believe that all of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>daily-entry journals (except for
        a few pages of writing for May and September 1804), from 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Charles, Mo.">St. Charles</name>to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and during the winter of
        1804–5, could be lost. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during that period filled three
        notebooks of writing, and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, the more verbose, would have
        written even more. Unless actual journals by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>or definite references to such
        writing are discovered, it seems likely that he kept no record of daily events for this
        period.</p>
            <p>One incident on the way to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>may corroborate the
        notion that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>kept no journal of daily events
        during that period. On July 14, 1804, a sudden storm hit the river, and great gusts of
        wind turned one boat on its side so that it began to fill with water. Cool heads and quick
        action saved the vessel from destruction, but 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>reported that his notes of the
        previous day had blown overboard during the accident. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>mentioned that the loss "obliges me
        to refur to the 〈notes〉 Journals of Serjeants, and my own recollection [of] the accurences
        Courses Distance &amp;. of that day." If 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had been keeping a journal of
        events during this time, why would 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>go to the journals of the sergeants
        or depend on his own recollection for the "accurences?" Certainly he would have trusted 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>notes over his memory or the
        notes of enlisted men if 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal had been available
        <ref target="ngi000043" n="43"/>
            </p>
            <p>From the April 7, 1805, departure from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>to late August 1805,
        complete notebook journals for both captains exist, with no fragmentary or parallel
        journals until August, although some copying was being done between the two men. There is
        no indication that either followed 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>earlier practice of writing field
        notes and transferring them, with revisions, into notebook journals. Indeed, there is no
        reason to assume that the captains consistently followed any one plan or procedure
        throughout the expedition. Their responsibility was to keep as complete a record as
        possible of the many kinds of information that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>wanted and to preserve that
        record from harm or loss. They could follow any procedure that suited their convenience
        and the conditions of the moment, in keeping with that mission. External conditions varied
        so much throughout the trip that there was every reason to change journal-keeping
        procedures to conform to the needs of the moment. When they were inconsistent in so much
        else, there is no reason to expect them to be consistent in this.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to believe, then, that for every finished journal there was a
        preliminary set of field notes nearly duplicating it, as in the case of the River Journal
        and Codices A and B. Without the known existence of field notes, or strong evidence
        requiring them, there is no need to assume that they were made. Duplication of journals
        would serve as insurance against loss or damage, but with both captains definitely keeping
        journals after April 7, 1805, there would be less need for keeping both field notes and
        notebook journals, which amounted to a time-consuming task.
        <ref target="ngi000044" n="44"/>
            </p>
            <p>Field notes, however, would be of value in situations where there was an increased risk
        of damage or loss from weather or difficult travel conditions, when it seemed wise to seal
        up the notebooks in tin boxes (described by 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>) and keep field notes easily
        accessible or carried on the person. Such precautions could also be taken when one of the
        captains was scouting ahead on foot, accompanied by only a few men; he might leave his
        notebook journals with the main body, for convenience or in case something happened to him
        and he did not return. After such separations, one might copy the experiences of the other
        into his own journal, to insure the preservation of a complete record.</p>
            <p>As they moved up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>around the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>, the
        captains were separated at various times in June, July, and August 1805, as one or the
        other was ahead, portaging the falls or later looking for the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone Indians</name>. In these
        intervals, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>sometimes copied 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journal for the days of separation
        under the date of their reunion, suggesting that he was keeping the notebook journal day
        by day. At other times, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>gave an account of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>activities in his own entries for
        each day, indicating that those entries must have been written after they were reunited. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>in this period did not ordinarily
        copy 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>record of daily events while
        they were separated.
        <ref target="ngi000045" n="45"/>
            </p>
            <p>In some of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>red notebooks are extra pages he
        apparently inserted, sometimes torn from other red books but at least once cut to fit from
        letter paper. The handwriting on the inserted sheets is neater and more legible than 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>usual bold but rather careless
        hand, but it is definitely 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>, and the need for legibility is
        the likely reason for many of the insertions. This circumstance strengthens the likelihood
        that the ordinary handwriting represents daily entries written on the trail, during the
        day or in camp. A notable example is 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>insertion of pages to recopy his
        survey notes of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>portage,
        already written in his rougher hand in the middle of his June 17, 1805, entry, probably
        during the course of the day. He decided to copy the notes over for greater legibility and
        in fact inserted more sheets than he needed. The inserted sheets are in the middle of the
        original rough notes.

            <p>There are four fragmentary journals by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>from August and September 1805,
        designated Codices Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd by Coues. Each consists of a few loose sheets
        covering periods of two to five days. Codex Fa describes events also related in more
        detail in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>Codex F; the others are all from
        periods after the end of Codex F, during a hiatus of over four months for which there are
        no other known 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>journals, except for a later
        fragment, Codex Ia.
        <ref target="ngi000047" n="47"/>It is tempting to regard them as being literally
        "fragments," that is, portions of a lost body of field notes by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>covering perhaps the entire gap in
        his journal from late August 1805, to January 1, 1806. But the fragments themselves
        provide no evidence for this hypothesis. If they had portions of a previous day's entry at
        the beginning, or of the next day's entry at the end, there would be good reason to regard
        them as portions of a larger body of notes now lost. On the contrary, however, they appear
        to be complete in themselves. Codex Fa has a dated heading for an entry at the end that
        was never written, since only a blank space follows the date on the last sheet of the
        codex. Moreover, all of the fragments except Fc relate to periods when the captains were
        separated; Fa chronicles a scouting excursion ahead of the main body when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>might have preferred not to risk
        his notebook journal, and the other two describe periods when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>scouted ahead and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had to keep a record of the
        movements of the main party. Codex Fc derives from two days of relative leisure at 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name>in
        western 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>may have intended to resume
        journal keeping after a lapse of about two weeks.

               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>later Codex Ia (November
        29–December 1, 1805) also covers part of a period of separation and gives no indication of
        being part of a larger whole.
        <ref target="ngi000049" n="49"/>
            </p>
            <p>In Codex G, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>sometimes groups courses and
        distances for several days in one place, suggesting that he may have kept this information
        in separate notes and transferred it to his notebooks when time allowed. It may be that he
        kept course and distance notes on the same sheets with sketch maps, as he did with 
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>maps 33–42, although no such maps have been found for the
        route from the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls</name>to 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name>in
        western 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>, traversed during the period covered in
        Codex G.</p>
            <p>On September 11 the Corps left 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name>on the
        
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>; this is the day on which 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Elkskin-bound Journal begins,
        continuing until December 31, 1805. It thus overlaps his red notebook journals Codex G (to
        October 10), Codex H (October 11–November 19), and Codex I (to December 31). This journal
        consists of sheets of letter paper sewn together and crudely bound in elkskin, presumably
        in the field. While we cannot be certain whether it was bound before or after writing, the
        fact that it ends precisely on the last day of 1805, the day before 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>known journal-writing again
        resumes, strongly suggests the latter.</p>
            <p>From September 11 to 20, the Elkskin-bound Journal consists of courses and distances,
        with sketch maps of the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>route. The courses and distances
        become progressively more detailed, briefly mentioning daily incidents; by September 13
        they are in effect short journal entries in themselves. After September 21, the book
        becomes a regular journal of daily events. Here some speculation seems warranted. The 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>was one of the roughest parts of the
        trip, the trail hazardous and the weather terrible; the horse carrying 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>writing desk slipped down a
        mountainside on the fifteenth, smashing the desk. These were conditions under which it
        would be prudent to seal up the notebook journals in tin boxes for protection and keep
        rough field notes along the trail. The sketch maps and courses and distances suggest that
        the elkskin book started out as the sort of route notes 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>kept at other times, such as those
        with 
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>maps 33–42. Their becoming progressively more extensive from
        September 11 to 20 suggests that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did indeed seal up Codex G at some
        point during this period, the Elkskin-bound Journal becoming the preliminary journal, the
        first draft for the notebooks. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>went ahead with a few men, looking
        for game, on September 18, and the courses and distances in the elkskin book become
        particularly extensive from that date. There can be no certainty, however, that was the
        date when Codex G was sealed up.</p>
            <p>From September 21, the elkskin book consists of regular daily entries in the
        conventional form, not in the form of courses and distances. September 20 was the day 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>met the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perces</name>at 
        <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">Weippe
        Prairie</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, a meeting described in some detail in the
        elkskin notebook courses and distances. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and the main party did not catch
        up until September 22. If Codex G was in a tin box on a packhorse with 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>group, we can understand why 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote his regular September 21 entry
        in the elkskin book. He traveled a few miles that day but gave no courses and distances
        until the next day, September 22, when he wrote, "our first course of yesterday was
        nearly. . .," as if he had not written it down anywhere else and was going by memory.
        There may have been no notes other than those in the elkskin book.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>courses and distances for September
        11–21 and September 25 are together in Codex G after the September 30 entry; he may have
        taken the notebook out on that day and brought it up to date, or he may have been keeping
        entries in it and simply have delayed copying the courses and distances because he was
        busy. In any case, he continued to keep journal entries in the elkskin book until December
        31, paralleling notebook journal entries in Codices G, H, and I. That the Elkskin-bound
        Journal entries were the first draft and the codices the second seems probable. For much
        of the period from early October to early December the expedition was going downriver in
        small dugout canoes, and when they neared the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Coast">Pacific Coast</name>they entered an area of almost
        constant rain and storms. It may have seemed wise to keep the red books in their
        waterproof boxes much of the time and continue to use the sheets that became the
        Elkskin-bound Journal.</p>
            <p>The elkskin book begins on the exact date of starting on the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>, which may indicate that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had not kept detailed field notes for
        some time before that but had written daily information directly into his notebook
        journals. He could well have been keeping course and distance notes, with sketch maps of
        the route, as he had earlier, notes such as the pages in the elkskin book apparently
        started out to be. But why were those bound notes preserved if similar ones for an earlier
        period (the summer and fall of 1805) were not saved also? We must, of course, allow
        something for sheer chance, but the special care taken to bind the notes suggests a
        particular need to preserve material covering that period. One reason for preserving them
        might be the exceptionally large number of maps (nineteen) along with the journal
        material; none of the maps of the Elkskin-bound Journal are repeated in the codices for
        the same period. Again note that there are, to our present knowledge, no notebook journals
        by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>from late August 1805, to January
        1, 1806; only fragmentary loose sheets are known, and all except one (Codex Fc) cover
        periods when the captains were separated.</p>
            <p>The Elkskin-bound Journal ends the day before 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>is known to have resumed his
        journal-keeping, the first day of 1806. It would be a remarkable coincidence if 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>just happened to run out of paper in
        the book on that day. Internal evidence indicates that large portions of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>notebook journals after early
        November 1805 were probably written months later. If the sheets in the elkskin book were
        the only continuous record by either captain for a period of over three and one-half
        months, then we can readily understand why they took special care to preserve them. If 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>red books were sealed up and packed
        away for much of that time, we can also understand why what started out as rough notes and
        sketch maps became a journal of events as well.

            </p>
            <p>What was 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>doing with his notebook journals
        during the period (September 11–December 31, 1805) covered by the Elkskin-bound Journal?
        Entries in late September and early October 1805 in Codex G are generally more extensive
        than those in the Elkskin-bound Journal; both are brief during periods when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was ill or particularly busy. After
        the party set out down the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater
        River</name>in canoes on October 7, the Elkskin-bound Journal again becomes primarily
        expanded courses and distances. Codex H, however, begins on October 11, and from this
        point the elkskin book entries again become progressively more detailed and lengthy, as if
        it were again the record actually kept on the given dates. On November 7, 1805, the day
        the party arrived, or so they thought, in sight of the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>records the event in both journals in
        terms suggesting immediate emotion.</p>
            <p>The Codex H entry for November 7, however, also contains a passage in quotes describing
        the dress of the local Indian women, noting that it was so skimpy that the "battery of
        venus is not altogether impervious to the penetrating eye of the amorite." Not only is the
        language most unlike 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>, but the whole paragraph is placed
        in quotation marks to indicate that it was not 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>. In fact, the whole paragraph
        occurs verbatim in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>Codex J entry for March 19,
        1806—over four months after the ostensible date of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>entry. This forces us to conclude
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote the November 7, 1805, entry in
        Codex H on or after March 19, 1806. Lacking any indication that the page with the quoted
        paragraph was inserted later, we must assume that the remainder of Codex H after that
        date—and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>subsequent notebook journals,
        largely copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>—were written on or after March
        19, 1806—an assumption that creates some intriguing problems.
        <ref target="ngi000051" n="51"/>
            </p>
            <p>There is some evidence, moreover, that much of Codex H before November 7, 1805, was not
        written until months after the given dates. In the entry in that journal for October 18, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>notes how "the Great Chief and one of
        the 
        <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Yakima Indians">Chim-nâ-pum</name>
               </hi>nation" on the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>drew for him a sketch of the upper 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>and its inhabitants and
        tributaries. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>copy of the sketch appears in the
        middle of the journal entry as if done at the same time as the entry itself. Yet the map
        labels as "Clark's River" the 
        <name type="place"
                     key="Pend Oreille (Clark's, Flathead, Lastaro, Lastaw) River">Pend
        Oreille River</name>where it enters the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. There is good reason to believe
        that the captains did not decide to give the name Clark's River to the combined 
        <name type="place" key="Bitterroot (Clark's, Flathead) River">Bitterroot</name>-
        <name type="person"
                     key="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River">Clark
        Fork</name>-
        <name type="place"
                     key="Pend Oreille (Clark's, Flathead, Lastaro, Lastaw) River">Pend
        Oreille</name>rivers until between April 17 and May 6, 1806 (see 
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>, pp. 10–11). An almost exact duplicate of the map in another
        notebook not containing daily entries shows the same stream as the "Flathead River," the
        name they used earlier. It may be, then, that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not write the October 18 entry
        until late April or early May of 1806, inserting the sketch the Indians had given him
        under the appropriate date by copying from an earlier version. Codex H begins only a few
        days before that date, on October 11, 1805, so it might well be that, on finishing Codex G
        on October 10, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>decided that since they were
        traveling downstream in canoes, it would be wise to use the Elkskin-bound Journal for
        daily journal keeping and keep his notebooks safely sealed away in boxes. As noted, the
        elkskin book's entries become increasingly extensive about this time.</p>
            <p>Codex H ends on November 19 with a brief entry and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>words "See another book for
        perticulars." Codex I takes up with a longer entry for the same date, but only after
        thirty-four pages of introductory miscellaneous material—courses and distances from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>, including some for a trip down the
        coast that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>made in January 1806. That Codex I
        then takes up the narrative on November 19, 1805, immediately after this collection of
        data, suggests that Codex H was finished and the daily entries in Codex I begun in
        sequence. If so, then 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>also wrote Codex I after March 19,
        1806, when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>wrote the "battery of venus"
        passage, which 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>copied under the date of November 7,
        1805, in Codex H.</p>
            <p>Why, then, did 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wait so long to write this material
        in the red books? Up to December 31, 1805, he was writing in the sheets bound in elkskin
        and may not have seen any reason to start another journal, or he may not have gotten
        around to it. There is no clear evidence of such notes continuing after the first day of
        1806. But 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Codex I has three short entries for
        January 1, 2, and 3 at one end of the book, upside down to all the rest of the writing in
        that book, which starts at the other end. It would seem that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>began Codex I as a continuation of
        the Elkskin-bound Journal (ending December 31), then decided to do something else. It
        appears that he again took up Codex H, filled it up with entries paralleling the elkskin
        book through November 19, then continued in sequence in Codex I; if so, then he evidently
        did so after March 19, the date of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>observations about the
        visibility of the "battery of venus." Apparently 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote no journals of which we have
        knowledge for nearly three months, and this at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, where he would have had
        relative leisure for writing. Codex I does contain a detailed record of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>trip down the 
        <name type="place" key="Oregon">Oregon</name>coast on January 6–10, taken from notes (here
        called First Draft, January 6–10, 1806) of the kind the captains kept on other occasions
        when separated. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>synopsis of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>trip is in his Codex J for January
        10, the day of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>return, and was likely written at
        that time from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>verbal account and First Draft
        notes.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>began a new journal (Codex J) on
        January 1, 1806, and continued a consistent writing until August 12 when he laid his pen
        down, ending his record of the expedition. That is the first journal writing by him, as
        far as we know, since August 1805, except for scattered fragments. Perhaps the new journal
        is another point of beginning as has been conjectured with Codices Aa, Ba, and Fc, and
        here his good intentions of journal keeping (combined perhaps with a New Year's
        resolution) were fulfilled. Codex J is a detailed record, to March 20, of life at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, and contains extensive
        descriptions of local flora and fauna and the life of the nearby Indians, with numerous
        illustrations. Nowhere else did 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>devote more time to fulfilling the
        scientific objectives of the expedition by recording so much. All of the observations are
        incorporated in the daily entries, generally after the record of the day's events. In what
        was evidently an additional measure to insure the preservation of this material, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>copied most of it into his journals
        almost verbatim. For some reason 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not always copy material under
        the same date as 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and sometimes placed it under an
        entry several days earlier than that of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>. Clearly he was not copying 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>day by day.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>copying of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>for the period after January 1,
        1806, is in a more careful, neater hand. There is no way of knowing whether 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>neater hand was something he could
        do at any time he chose to make the effort, or whether it represents writing at leisure
        and in comfort after the return from the voyage. But if the reason for copying from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was insurance against loss, it
        would make more sense to complete it as soon as possible during the journey.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>Codex J also includes natural
        history material appropriate to the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>and Interior Basin, notes
        additional to the few fragments extant for that period. If 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had kept a journal for that period
        (August-December 1805), why did he copy it into daily entries for the time at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>? Why not copy it into a
        separate journal covering the actual dates? That question must remain a mystery. There
        must have been some sort of natural history field notes or other journals for that period
        that are now lost. If 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>did have notes in daily journal
        form covering the August-December gap, why did he not copy them into his own journal at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>when he would have had
        time? One answer might be that the notes he had were mainly natural history and
        ethnographic material, and that he did copy them into Codex J, under current dates. If
        both 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were copying from supposed notes made
        by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>before arriving at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, then it might be clear
        why 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>version of the scientific material
        comes under different dates than in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journals, while his daily record
        of events follows 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>verbatim on the same dates. But 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>duplication of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>natural history notes in the
        codices (particularly Codex J) is so exact that the hypothetical notes must themselves
        have been as elaborate as those in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>notebooks.

            </p>
            <p>As noted, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>apparently did not write his November
        7, 1805 entry in Codex H until on or after March 19, 1806, when he copied the "battery of
        venus" passage into that entry. March 19, when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>evidently wrote the paragraph, was
        just four days before the expedition left 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>on the return trip. We
        can hardly imagine 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>writing over four months' worth of
        notebook journals, including extensive natural history notes, in that period of time,
        which surely was crowded with preparations for leaving. If he was copying from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>after the departure from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>, when did he do it—along
        the trail, during the lengthy stopover at 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>in 
        <name type="place" key="Idaho">Idaho</name>, or after the arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>? And what did he do about his
        own daily journalizing during the homeward journey?</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>copying of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>continues during the first few
        days of the party's journey up the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>; he was still writing in the same
        book (Voorhis No. 2 in Thwaites's numbering system) and the entries could have been
        written some time later. The last two days of Voorhis No. 2, April 2 and 3, describe 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>trip up the 
        <name type="place" key="Willamette (Multnomah) River">Willamette River</name>on those days
        and could easily have been taken from field notes.
        <ref target="ngi000053" n="53"/>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>copied that narrative under his
        April 6 entry, with some changes in wording. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Voorhis No. 3 begins on April 4 and
        is more a record of daily events without the extended descriptions copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>.</p>
            <p>Since Voorhis No. 3 takes up immediately where No. 2 leaves off, however, it is logical
        to think that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not start No. 3 until the other
        was finished—perhaps some time after the given date. Under April 6, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>again has some natural history data
        copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>entry of April 7. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>may have been keeping some sort of
        field notes at this time. There are such notes made by him for the period of April 16–21,
        but for most of that time the captains were separated, with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>trading for food at various Indian
        villages near the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the
        Columbia</name>. He might well have not wanted to be troubled with carrying a notebook
        journal at that time, but perhaps he was not keeping a journal at all in the period of the
        journey upriver. We have no idea when the two decided that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>should copy 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>
               <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>journals, perhaps doing
        no journalizing himself in the meantime, although the short entries for January 1–3 in his
        Codex I suggest the decision was taken in early January 1806. Nor is it clear how long
        after March 19 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>waited to begin his copying.</p>
            <p>From May 14 to June 10, 1806, the expedition was at rest at 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>, on the north bank
        of the 
        <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Clearwater

        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>country of

        the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>for their passage east. In this
        extended period of relative leisure 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>might have done some of the extensive
        copying from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journals. As noted, the use of
        the name "Clark's Fork" in a map placed with the October 18, 1805, entry in Codex H
        suggests that much of that notebook journal was not written until late April or early May
        of 1806, or later. That possibility would fit well with the hypothesis that much of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>catching up in his notebook
        journals and his copying from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>took place at 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>in May and June of
        1806. Voorhis No. 3 has on its flyleaf a list of 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name>(
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>) names for rivers;
        that fact suggests that the book, covering April 4–June 6, 1806, was out of its box and
        readily available during the period to record the information. Perhaps 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>finished his copying at 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>, although it would
        have been a substantial task. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>records events of the period in words
        very similar to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>, but daily events could
        obviously have been copied the day they happened. It is notable, however, that after the
        end of May we no longer have passages in 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journal that are clearly copied
        from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, placed by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>under dates earlier than in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal.

            <p>At the beginning of Codex M is a map of the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</name>based on a sketch given by "Sundary
        Indians of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name>Nation on the 29th
        30th and 31st of May 1806." 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>may not have copied the sketch until
        several days later, but its presence in Codex M, which begins on June 6, near the end of
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Chopunnish (Idaho)">Camp Chopunnish</name>sojourn, suggests
        that the book was unpacked and available at that time. It is therefore possible that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>copying from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was complete to June 6 and he was
        able to start Codex M on the actual date.</p>
            <p>Having returned to 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo (Travelers' Rest) Creek (Mont.)">Travelers' Rest</name>, the
        captains split the party on July 3, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>going northeast to seek a shorter
        route to the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>southeast to explore the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>. By all previous experience
        they should each have kept a journal during the period of separation, especially since
        they would be covering territory they had not previously explored.
        <ref target="ngi000055" n="55"/>Did they keep field notes on the trail or write in their
        notebook journals?</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>Codex L runs to July 4, then
        resumes after eighteen blank pages with an entry for July 15; that is the only such
        unfilled gap in time in a notebook journal. The fragmentary Codex La (July 3–15) covers
        that period, and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>probably intended it as the first
        draft. He probably packed away the notebook Codex L for safekeeping while traveling
        through the mountains, then resumed writing in it on July 15, leaving the blank pages to
        fill in later from the material in Codex La. In fact he never got around to that, probably
        because he quit writing entirely on August 12, by which date all the writing in Codex L
        was probably complete. He probably wrote his account of the violent encounter with the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>on July 27–28 at least
        a few days later, after rejoining his party following a hurried ride across country. He
        continued Codex L to August 8, after which the fragmentary Codex Lb covers August 9–12; on
        the twelfth 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>stopped writing entirely because
        of discomfort from the accidental gunshot wound inflicted by 
        <name type="person" key="Cruzatte, Pierre">Pierre Cruzatte</name>on August 11. He had
        rejoined 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on August 12, and the latter could
        now keep a record for the whole party.</p>
            <p>The loose pages constituting Codex Lb were evidently once part of a red notebook found
        among 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>papers, which bears on its cover
        the notation "9 to 12 Augt. 1806"; it now contains no expeditionary material. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>evidently began writing in the
        book after finishing Codex L, then stopped after a few days because of the pain of his
        wound. In later years 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>removed those few pages to use the
        book for other purposes. Considering the unfilled gap in Codex L, it appears that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal keeping ceased entirely
        on August 12, 1806, and was then complete as it now stands.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>travels after leaving 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>involved several shifts from
        horseback to canoes and back to horses, but there is little indication that he did not
        write entries directly into his notebook journal (Codex M) for much of the period. A
        fragment for this period, covering the days July 13–19 and July 24–August 3, consists of
        courses and distances for his 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>exploration—July 13 was the
        day he left the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">Three Forks of the
        Missouri</name>headed for the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>. The Codex M entries for
        those days are much more extensive than the material in the fragment. The gap in the
        fragment represents the period when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party stopped to build canoes, when
        there were no courses and distances to be recorded. Codex M has fairly extensive entries
        for those days. The Codex M entries through July 23 are in sequence, with no large gaps or
        crowding; as far as we can tell, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>could either have been keeping that
        journal day by day, or he could have brought it up to date to the twenty-third while
        encamped.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>reached the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, at the mouth of the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>, on August 3. At the end of
        his August 3 entry in Codex M is a passage, over two pages in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>hand, describing the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>, which obviously 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>could not have written before the
        captains' reunion on August 12. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>August 4 entry then follows on the
        next page without any gap. Unless 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>managed to fit his passage neatly
        into a gap left by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, then the subsequent entries by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>must also have been written after
        August 12. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>may have written the passage on
        August 12 before he stopped writing, but he could also have written it weeks later, after
        he had largely recovered from his gunshot wound, even after the arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>.</p>
            <p>In his August 10 entry in Codex M, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>gives a description of a cherry in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>characteristic technical
        vocabulary, which is in fact copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>description in Codex Lb for
        August 12; 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>could not have copied it before
        August 12, the date of their reunion.
        <ref target="ngi000056" n="56"/>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>has a lengthy description of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>experiences after their parting,
        with courses and distances, in his August 12 entry. The day of their reunion was the
        logical place for that information, but there is no proof that he actually wrote it on the
        twelfth. After that narration, however, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>finishes the entry with the remaining
        events of August 12, the natural sequence if he had written the entry on that date.</p>
            <p>The last daily entry in Codex M is that of August 14; it breaks off in the middle and
        is taken up in Codex N, an unusual procedure for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. The entry in Codex M runs into the
        bottom of a weather table for the month of August 1806, which is complete to the end of
        the month. It is not clear which was written first, since 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>might have broken off the August 14
        entry to leave space for finishing the weather table already started. Otherwise, we would
        have to assume he wrote the August 14 entry after the end of August. Codex N takes up
        under the heading of August 15, yet it clearly describes the same Indian council as that
        of August 14, in Codex M; the transition from one day to the next is never clear. Hurried
        copying at a later date might be the explanation of the unusual confusion of dates.</p>
            <p>At the end of Codex M, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote an undated "Memorandom" to
        himself about some things that needed to be done; among them was to "Copy a Sketch of the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">rochjhone [Yellowstone]</name>." Under the date
        of August 10, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>notes that he "finished a copy of my
        Sketches of the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">River Rochejhone</name>," which may mean the
        memorandum was written before that date. He also notes that he must make "a copy of the
        courses and distances," perhaps meaning to copy the fragment giving courses and distances
        for July 13–19 and July 24–August 3. The last item is "to fill up [vacinces?] in my book."
        Those "vacancies" could be merely the various blanks left in the journals for names of
        streams decided on later; they could be portions of pages left blank for insertion of
        material; or they could be more extensive blank spaces in the notebooks. At any rate, the
        note emphasizes the uncertainty for scholars of determining when any particular entry or
        portion of one was written.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Codex N has several blank spaces at
        the end of entries, perhaps left for insertion of extra information in case of need; that
        provides no satisfactory indication of when the writing was done. Codex N also contains
        miscellaneous notes that could have been made at various dates. The first two pages
        (including one side of the front flyleaf) are lists of goods shipped from 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>after the expedition's return,
        written in the same direction as the journal entries that follow. It is possible, then,
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>wrote the whole of the daily entries
        in the book (August 15–September 26) after the latter date. The use of the flyleaf,
        however, might be taken as an indication that the list was written after the journal
        entries. The confusion of dates at the beginning of Codex N, the gaps perhaps left for
        later insertions, and one instance (August 16–17) where one day's entry runs over into the
        beginning of the next, could all be taken as indications of haste. Such haste, however,
        could belong either to the period of the final rush downriver by the homesick explorers,
        or to the period after the return, when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was trying to finish his task. Codex
        N ends on September 26, three days after the arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>; the entries are progressively
        shorter the last few days, the last two notably so. There is no discernible reason why 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>chose to end at this particular point
        rather than on the day of arrival; that would be especially odd if he were copying the
        material from notes later.</p>
            <p>There is still doubt, then, as to when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>finished his writing. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>statement that "ten or
        twelve" red books were turned over to him on 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>return is too vague to support
        any precise conclusions. If 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>showed the president all his own
        and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>daily notebook journals—Codices D
        through N and Voorhis Nos. 1, 2, and 3, there would be fourteen red books.
        <ref target="ngi000057" n="57"/>That leaves room for some unfinished journal keeping by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, consisting most probably of Codex N
        and part of Codex M if there was any such unfinished work. If 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had delivered the remaining material
        on or soon after his own arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>on January 21, 1807, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>might not have considered the
        circumstance memorable or worth mentioning years later, especially since he always tended
        to think and write of the expedition and the journals as essentially 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>.</p>
            <p>The reader may not think the above a substantial advance beyond 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">David McKeehan's</name>statement of 1807 that
        "the several journals were brought together . . . and the blanks . . . filled up . . . at
        the different resting places." That is the procedure common sense would suggest, and it
        accords with the evidence available. In all probability, the bulk of the journals were
        complete when 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>saw them, some three months
        after the end of the expedition. Neither 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>nor 
        <name type="person" key="McKeehan, David">McKeehan</name>made any specific mention of
        field notes, but they were certainly made because some still exist. The possibility
        remains that the captains made other field notes and that some of those may yet be found.
        The evidence, however, does not require us to assume extensive sets of field notes
        amounting to duplicate journals covering the whole journey and copied into notebooks
        during or after the expedition.</p>
            <p>Neither does the evidence indicate a uniform journal-keeping procedure followed
        consistently throughout the expedition. The captains followed their own convenience so far
        as consistent with making a complete record and with the safety of the documents
        themselves. If they had any fixed procedure in mind when they started out, they were
        certainly flexible enough to change it in the light of experience. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>full and extensive Field Notes for
        the journey up to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>do not prove the
        existence of such notes for periods when none have been found. There are good reasons for
        believing that both captains wrote parts of their notebook journals later than their given
        dates, in the case of some of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journals months later. At other
        times the evidence suggests that they kept the notebook journals day by day or soon after
        the given dates. They may have written in the notebook journals daily when the going was
        fairly smooth and the books were easily transported and protected. Under bad conditions
        they probably sealed up the notebooks in tin boxes for safety, using more or less
        extensive rough notes to keep a daily record.</p>
            <p>The most significant criterion for the use of field notes would be the risk factor. In
        the beginning, when they were still gaining experience and testing procedures (on the
        journey to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>), when travel and
        weather conditions were particularly bad (on the 
        <name type="place" key="Lolo Trail">Lolo Trail</name>), or during separations (the trip to
        the whale site on the 
        <name type="place" key="Oregon">Oregon</name>coast), we can expect to find field notes
        with the finished journals.</p>
            <p>The presence of several fragmentary, unbound codices naturally suggests a comparison
        with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes of the first year;
        could they be the remains of a similar comprehensive set of preliminary journals, the
        basis of the notebook journals? The majority of them represent periods when the captains
        were separated; does this mean that the authors wrote them only because of that
        circumstance, or was that the reason those notes were preserved while many others were
        discarded? None of the fragments gives a clear indication of being part of a more
        extensive body of notes. There are no parts of a previous day's entry at the beginning,
        nor the beginning of another entry cut off at the bottom of the last page. In one or two
        cases the author may have intended to continue but left blank space indicating he never
        got around to it. The same appears to be the case with the Elkskin-bound Journal. The
        "fragments," as far as the evidence goes, are complete in themselves and not the remains
        of something larger. There was nothing, after all, to prevent the author of each fragment
        from copying it into his notebook and then discarding it with the rest of his hypothetical
        field notes. The preservation of these scattered pieces is more likely to have been the
        result of the captains' desire to preserve everything that could possibly be useful and
        relevant. Because so many of the fragments are 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>, they are part of the mysteries
        surrounding his journal keeping.</p>
            <p>Nine of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>fragmentary codices (Aa, Ba, Fa,
        Fb, Fc, Fd, Fe, Ia, and Lb) are apparently pages taken from notebooks, all but one (Ia)
        from red books. It is possible that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>removed the pages before writing
        on them, but it is equally possible that the writing was done in the books and the pages
        removed at some later period. Codex Fc, for instance, came from Codex P, and there is some
        reason to believe that those pages were not removed until 1810, when the book was used to
        copy natural history notes for 
        <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Benjamin Smith Barton</name>. As noted,
        many of the fragments represent periods when the captains were separated or when weather
        and travel conditions posed a special risk to the journals. On such occasions 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>may have used a book that was
        largely blank, containing perhaps some relatively unimportant or duplicated data. Thus if
        the book he was carrying with him was damaged by weather or a dip in a river, or if he
        failed to return from a scouting mission, important material would not be lost, as would
        be the case if a regular daily journal suffered. This possibility may strengthen the
        likelihood that the so-called fragments are complete in themselves and not part of a body
        of lost field notes. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>reference to the red books
        as "travelling pocket journals," although he was not present when they were written, at
        least suggests that some of them were at some times carried on the person. Their size
        renders this quite possible. The "fragment" pages could have been removed from the books
        during the expedition, after the return, or when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>were working on the journals in
        1810. If 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>did have daily field notes and did
        not get them copied, what happened to them? When they saved so much else—so many
        fragments, scraps, and sketches—why not save material by the expedition leader covering
        periods when there is no other writing by him? Once again we have hypothetical lost
        journals, for whose existence there is no real evidence.</p>
            <p>When 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>gave 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>custody of the notebook
        journals in 1810, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>retained some of his own notebooks,
        which became part of Thwaites's discovery of material from the Voorhis family. The ones he
        retained covered periods for which there are known 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>journals. The ones turned over to 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>cover the periods where no 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>journals are known to exist and
        the long separation in the summer of 1806. It certainly appears that the basis of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>choice of which of his own books to
        give 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>was the existence or nonexistence
        of journals by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>covering the same period. If so,
        then the present gaps in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journals apparently existed by
        1810 at the latest, and as noted no letters are known that lament the loss of daily
        journals by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, either at the time of his death
        or earlier.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Elkskin-bound Journal represents a
        special case where extra care was taken to preserve a lengthy body of what evidently
        started out as rough course and distance notes with sketch maps made on the spot. But for
        most of the period covered by that journal there is no known writing by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, and it seems that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not write his notebook journals
        for at least half the period until months later. Moreover, conditions during the period
        were often such that the notebooks would have been safer in their sealed boxes. The
        Elkskin-bound Journal ends at the very point where 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>known journalizing resumes.</p>
            <p>From the evidence it appears that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>kept no regular journal for almost
        three months at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>(January, February, and
        March 1806), while 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was keeping his journal with its
        extensive notes on natural history and ethnology. Either they planned all along for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to copy those notes or decided on
        this precaution at some later point for safety's sake. It is unclear when 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>completed the copying of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>
               <name type="place" key="Fort Clatsop (Oreg.)">Fort Clatsop</name>journals or when he wrote
        the remainder of his notebook journals—how much he completed on the trail or how much, if
        any, after reaching 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>. We can only guess how long it
        took him to copy from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>or to compose his own entries. He
        introduced many of his own characteristic spellings into copied material, indicating that
        he was not trying to achieve literal faithfulness, and he sometimes changed the wording
        and included material from his own experiences where it seemed relevant.</p>
            <p>At points where a notebook journal appears from good evidence to have been written
        weeks or months after the given date, it is not unreasonable to suppose the existence of
        some sort of field notes to assist memory. The clearest and most extreme case of the sort,
        
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>notebook journals of fall 1805 to
        spring 1806 (Codices H and I and Voorhis No. 2), is explained by the existing
        Elkskin-bound Journal (from November 1805 to December 31, 1805), and after January 1, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journals. In cases where the
        interval between the given date and the actual writing of the entry was shorter, the notes
        could have been as extensive as the existing field notes of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>from the first year, or they might
        have been in the nature of expanded course and distance notes with sketch maps, of which
        various examples remain.</p>
            <p>There is little reason to accept the theory that the red notebook journals were all
        written after the return from subsequently discarded field notes. Considering the great
        amount of extant material and the labor involved in writing it, we need not imagine
        extensive sets of field notes paralleling the notebooks when the existence of such notes
        is neither known nor required by the evidence. Whatever 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>"we commenced wrighting" in his
        last journal entry refers to, it was probably not the task of writing all the red books
        covering a year and a half of travel. Most of the material we now have was written by the
        captains in the course of the expedition. In reading it, we are in a sense traveling with
        them and sharing their day-by-day experiences and uncertainties.</p>

            <p>Whatever the nature of the "wrighting" mentioned in 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>last journal entry, the captains
        were in no doubt about the importance of their written record. Much of 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson's</name>instructions to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>consisted of either detailed lists
        of the sort of information they were to record or admonitions about the importance of
        making duplicates and preserving their notes against loss. If they could make contact with
        some American ship on the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>coast, even if they did not choose to
        return by sea, they were to send some trustworthy member of the Corps of Discovery home by
        that route with a copy of their journals to date. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>wanted a full record of their
        findings to present to the world as soon as possible in a multivolume work, including a
        narrative of the journey and a full exposition of their scientific and geographic
        discoveries, with appropriate maps and illustrations. The published accounts of 
        <name type="person" key="Cook, James">Captain Cook's</name>voyages and the journals of
        American naturalist 
        <name type="person" key="Bartram, William">William Bartram</name>probably provided models
        of what 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had in mind. Certainly he did
        not intend to have the journals published in their original, rough form; the convention of
        the time demanded that someone should produce a polished, literary version. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>intended that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, who had the sort of literary

        with the work would meet repeated delays and frustrations; indeed, no one alive at the
        time would see the full record presented to the world. For all his good intentions, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>himself was responsible for
        many of the initial delays, for he promptly appointed 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and

        would be a narrative of the journey, the second would present the geography and "a view of
        the Indian Nations," and the third would give the scientific results. "

        working on the narrative but the frustrations and pressures he met also tragically
        disrupted his personal life. Financial difficulties, political opposition, and probably
        alcoholism brought him to despair. In October 1809, on a journey to 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>to straighten out his tangled

        have sought to prove that he was murdered. At the time of his death he had done nothing to
        prepare the narrative of the expedition for publication, but fortunately, the journals
        were found in his personal belongings. The task now fell to

            <p>In the meantime, Sergeant 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>had published a heavily revised version
        of his journal in 1807. To supplement their own records, the captains had required the

        discussed in another part of this volume, and existing journals will appear in this

        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>had no permission to publish, and

        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did indeed have to take over and
        finish their joint task, now in a phase for which he considered himself little qualified.
        We might have expected that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, having left the presidency
        in 1809, would have had the time, as he certainly had the qualifications, to prepare the
        work for publication himself, but there is no evidence that he ever considered it,
        although he maintained his interest in its progress.</p>
            <p>With 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>death, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>became custodian of the captains'
        journals, and to him fell the duty of preparing the narrative account of the expedition.
        Unsure of his own literary abilities, he turned to 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Nicholas Biddle</name>, a literary figure of 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>. Reluctant at first to
        accept the task, 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>eventually acquiesced and agreed
        to visit 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>at 
        <name type="place" key="Fincastle, Va.">Fincastle</name>,

        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>spent about three weeks in the
        spring of 1810, learning about the expedition and poring over the journals. 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>took copious notes in partially
        filled and unused notebooks from the expedition. His task was to write an account of the
        trip while leaving scientific matters to others. 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>had full use of the captains'
        journals at that time and 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant John Ordway's</name>journal as well, and
        took most of them with him. Later in 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>he had the personal
        assistance of

            <p>After 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>return to the West, he and 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>corresponded about the problems of
        publication and further questions that occurred to 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>. The failure of 
        <name type="person" key="Conrad, John">John Conrad's</name>publishing business in 1812
        further delayed publication. In 1813, 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>made arrangements with another 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>firm, Bradford and Inskeep,
        and also turned the work over to 
        <name type="person" key="Allen, Paul">Paul Allen</name>for final revision. Although 
        <name type="person" key="Allen, Paul">Allen's</name>contribution was secondary, his name
        was the only one to appear on the title page as author. 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>probably followed a literary
        convention of the time that a gentleman did not publish under his own name, if he did not

            <p>For nearly eighty years 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>work, except for the 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>volume, would stand as the sole

        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and

        that in it they were reading the actual journals of the captains. 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>was scrupulous about accuracy,
        taking care to question 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on innumerable points. He had not
        traveled in the West, and he could not have known the country as the captains did. Because
        of a personal interest in ethnology, he included much of the wealth of information to be
        gleaned from the journals about native peoples. Certainly his care, together with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>map of the West published with it (
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>map 126), helped make the work a valuable source of
        information on the country and its people.</p>

        history appear in

        <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Barton</name>in 1810 and had the natural
        history notes in the daily-entry journals copied into other notebooks for the naturalist.
        Because of 
        <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Barton's</name>age and failing health,
        and perhaps his procrastination, no volume on the scientific achievements of the

            <p>After 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>had deposited the journals with
        the American Philosophical Society in 1817 and 1818, the volumes rested virtually
        untouched for some seventy-five years, and 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>history remained their only
        representation to the world. Yet the 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>paraphrase was by no means all
        that 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had hoped; in particular, the
        omission of the scientific findings helped establish a view of the expedition, common to
        this day, as primarily a romantic adventure. That conception was altered largely through
        the work of one man of large scientific achievements and with an unassailable conviction
        of the correctness of his own views. Elliott Coues became the next editor of the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>documents and in his work illuminated
        the numerous scientific discoveries of the captains. Moreover, he codified the society's
        expedition documents under a reference system that is in use to this day. Although Coues
        was to become one of the most notable editors of western historical documents, his
        professional training was in quite different fields. He had served for eighteen years as
        an army surgeon, but his great interest was in birds, and he had become the leading
        American ornithologist of his day. His military duties took him to various regions
        traversed by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, so that, unlike 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>, he had firsthand knowledge of
        the West. He came to the editing task in 1891 when publisher Francis P. Harper sought
        someone to prepare a new edition of 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>history.
        <ref target="ngi000065" n="65"/>
            </p>
            <p>In a sense, Coues rediscovered the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>manuscripts that had been deposited
        by 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>with the American
        Philosophical Society in 1817 and 1818. Since that time the journals had hardly been
        touched, and although they were not lost, they were certainly little known. Society
        records demonstrate that while the journals rested securely in the archives between 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>and Coues's time there were a
        number of applications for their use. In 1837, Secretary of War Joel Poinsett asked the
        society to loan the journals to John James Audubon, who wished to prepare a natural
        history of the expedition. Audubon was then in Europe, and it was decided not to risk the
        journals to an ocean voyage, but the society offered full use of them at 
        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Pa.">Philadelphia</name>. In 1884, the society
        published its minutes up to 1838, which revealed to readers that the journals were in its
        keeping. During the next few years, ethnologists Daniel G. Brinton and Henry Henshaw and
        geographer Alfred J. Hill inquired about the manuscripts. But it was Coues who rekindled
        the nation's interest in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.
        <ref target="ngi000066" n="66"/>
            </p>
            <p>During the Christmas season of 1892, Coues began to examine the manuscript journals in
        the study of his home at 1726 N Street, 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington, D.C.</name>, having been loaned the
        documents to prepare his edition of 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>work. Coues was unawed by these
        original notebooks, for he quickly began to set them in order for easy reference and to
        tamper with them in a shameless fashion. He removed their brass holding clasps; he
        reordered and covered loose pages and set them in chronological sequence; and he labeled
        each notebook and paginated the lot. He even made a secret copy of the whole without the
        knowledge or consent of the society. Moreover, he added numerous and sometimes long
        interlinear notations and trimmed several ragged pages. For those reasons, despite their
        admiration for Coues's edition (his annotation was a magnificent addition to 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>work), scholars have been
        critical of the doctor.
        <ref target="ngi000067" n="67"/>
            </p>
            <p>Not all that Coues did to the journals, however, should be considered detrimental. His
        labeling, reordering, and paging of the notebooks and loose papers provide a practical way
        of cataloging and referring to the journals. Besides designating the notebooks as codices
        and setting them in chronological order, Coues wrote out a lengthy description of the
        journals' contents—noting maps, drawings, figures, and tables—and discussed the authorship
        and disposition of each journal. All that work is very helpful, although it does not
        excuse his defacing of the manuscripts.
        <ref target="ngi000068" n="68"/>
            </p>
            <p>Coues's 1893 edition of 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">History</hi>was in many ways a masterly work. He was able to identify
        many of the plants and animals mentioned and to locate many geographical points. With the
        aid of the journals, he elucidated many of 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>obscure passages, adding
        extensive supplementary quotes from the journals. Coues was a champion of the footnote,
        undaunted by problems of space; his notes come close to outrunning 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>text, and he was willing to
        alter 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>language when quoting from the
        journals. He seldom hesitated to interject his own opinions or information, whether or not
        it was relevant to the subject; in particular, he could not refrain from mentioning if he
        had visited points passed by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and he seldom admitted doubt on any
        point if he could possibly avoid it. Nonetheless, his editorial work was a major
        contribution to the knowledge of the expedition.
        <ref target="ngi000069" n="69"/>
            </p>
            <p>Coues evidently made his secret copy of the journals in anticipation of editing them
        for publication himself, but other work and his early death in 1899 prevented this.
        <ref target="ngi000070" n="70"/>Instead, the job fell to Reuben Gold Thwaites, who
        undertook the task for the publishing firm of Dodd, Mead and Company in 1901. Thwaites,
        head of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, was already an experienced editor of
        several western historical documents. In the course of his 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>research he discovered a number of
        new documents that greatly enhanced his edition. He included everything from the
        expedition that had been deposited at the American Philosophical Society by 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>but decided against including 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>journal because he considered it
        easily available elsewhere. Among his discoveries were the journals of 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Sergeant Charles Floyd</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Private Joseph Whitehouse</name>and, even
        more important, a number of daily journals and other documents by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>that the latter had retained instead
        of giving them to 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>in 1810. Those were in the
        possession of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>granddaughter and
        great-granddaughter, 
        <name type="person" key="Voorhis, Julia Clark">Julia Clark Voorhis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Voorhis, Eleanor Glasgow">Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis</name>, and now
        constitute the Voorhis Collection at the Missouri Historical Society, 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>. (See Appendixes B and C.)
        <ref target="ngi000071" n="71"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thwaites's work would surely have satisfied 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>. All scientific material was
        included as well as the maps found in the Voorhis Collection. He also printed a number of
        the letters from the collection in an appendix. Yet Thwaites labored under certain
        handicaps of space and time and lacked the broad geographic and scientific knowledge that
        Coues brought to his work. Errors of transcription slipped by, and his organization of
        materials is open to criticism in some respects. By the standards of a later generation,
        his annotation was meager and somewhat erratic; he borrowed from Coues's footnotes and
        supplemented them with help from other scientists and his own knowledge of western
        history. The deficiencies of his work demonstrate both the increasing intellectual
        specialization and the amount of scholarship that remained to be done on the expedition.
        Nonetheless, Thwaites made available to the world for the first time the bulk of the
        captains' and their subordinates' journals, more or less as the authors had prepared them.
        It was his work that made possible the subsequent generations of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>scholarship that have finally
        rendered a new edition necessary.
        <ref target="ngi000072" n="72"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thwaites thought he had probably uncovered all the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>material still in existence, but
        within a decade of his edition, new documents became available. Among expedition papers
        discovered by 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>grandsons in their grandfather's
        papers in 1913 were the three-volume journal of 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant John Ordway</name>and a journal kept by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and later 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>of the preliminary trip from
        Pittsburgh to 
        <name type="place" key="Camp Dubois (Camp Wood, River Dubois) (Ill.)">Camp Dubois</name>,
        from August 30 to December 12, 1803. Thwaites had known that 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>had kept a journal and had been
        searching for it when he discovered the Voorhis journals, but the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>document—here called the Eastern
        Journal—was a totally unexpected discovery, for no one had suspected that any notes were
        kept on this initial phase of the trip. The editorial work on 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>journal and the Eastern Journal went
        to Milo Milton Quaife, Thwaites's successor at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.
        Quaife was a professional historian, though at the time he took the job he lacked the
        editorial experience of both Coues and Thwaites, and the scientific and geographic
        knowledge of Coues. He carefully compared 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>account with those of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, and 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>. He restrained himself in
        annotation, unlike Coues, and most of his notes relate to geography; however, he has been
        criticized for his dearth of annotation.

            <p>The rediscoveries of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>documents described thus far, while
        pleasant surprises to scholars, were in places where such materials might reasonably have
        been expected, if they were in existence. In 1953, however, a major find came to light
        under totally unexpected circumstances. In 
        <name type="place" key="Saint Paul, Minn.">St. Paul, Minnesota</name>, Lucile M. Kane,
        curator of manuscripts for the Minnesota Historical Society, inspected the papers stored
        in an old desk of General John Henry Hammond, who had died in 1890. One bundle of papers,
        wrapped in a 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington, D.C.</name>newspaper, proved to be
        sixty-seven sheets of field notes written by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>in 1804 and 1805, with some
        interpolations by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>. Portions of them cover the
        winter at 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River Dubois</name>, about which little was
        previously known. The rest consist of preliminary notes for the period May 14, 1804–April
        13, 1805, though entries are less frequent after November 1804. The first group of papers
        has been called the Dubois Journal while the second set has been labeled the River
        Journal. Thwaites had suspected that such notes were made, then copied and expanded in the
        regular notebooks at some subsequent time that he could not determine, and the new find
        confirmed his surmise, at least for the period of the River Journal.

            <p>Ernest Staples Osgood, an experienced historian of the West, became editor of the Field
        Notes, but litigation over the ownership of the documents interrupted his work. The heirs
        of Hammond's estate eventually regained control of the papers from the Minnesota
        Historical Society and sold them. The final private owners, Frederick W. Beinecke and
        family, ultimately donated them to Yale University where they remain today. Osgood then
        concluded his editing of the papers and his book was published in 1964 by Yale University
        Press. Osgood's work is in many ways the best in the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>story to date. In annotating the
        Dubois Journal, he was able to illuminate a period hitherto largely obscure; the portions
        dealing with the actual journey to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, though covering more
        familiar events, provided much useful supplementary knowledge. Osgood devoted a lengthy
        introduction to the many problems of the origin and history of the documents and provided
        facsimiles so that readers could make their own comparisons.

            <p>The need for a new edition of the journals has been apparent for some time. The number
        of discoveries of new journals and the nature of modern editorial techniques have made
        Thwaites's edition somewhat obsolete. In fact, Thwaites did not publish everything that
        was available in his day, for he omitted some miscellaneous material in the Voorhis
        Collection, and he did not include 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass's</name>journal in his volumes since it was
        accessible at the time. Quaife also neglected to publish everything that came in with the 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle</name>family deposit but concentrated
        instead on the two outstanding finds, the Eastern Journal and 
        <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway's</name>Journal. Those items and other
        overlooked material will be in this edition. More recently discovered material is also
        available here for the first time, most important, 
        <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph Whitehouse's</name>paraphrased
        journal, discovered in 1966, which extends the available portion of the original.
        Moreover, the difficulty of obtaining some published material today (especially Quaife's
        and Osgood's works) has increased the need for this edition. Considering Thwaites's gaps,
        slight as they are, we can say that this is the first comprehensive, collated edition of
        all known journals.</p>
            <p>The principal goal of the new edition is to present users with a reliable, definitive
        text. The aim is to approach Coues's unfulfilled ambition of creating a text that is
        "verbatim et literatim et punctuatim." Earlier editors, pressed for time and working
        virtually alone, were not so fortunate as to have several reviews by different persons of
        their transcriptions. Every effort is being made here to present a transcript that is
        nearly identical to the original.</p>
            <p>The new edition will also give readers a thorough, uniform annotation of the journals.
        Previous editors, at least until Osgood, have relied largely on the work of Coues in his
        annotation of 
        <name type="person" key="Biddle, Nicholas">Biddle's</name>paraphrased edition of 1814 or
        have not annotated as thoroughly as present users wish. Scholars have been particularly
        struck by the paucity of notes in Thwaites's edition. With the publication of Osgood's
        work in 1964, it became clear how antiquated previous editions were. Osgood had
        considerable editing skills, but he also benefited from the great amount of
        twentieth-century scholarship on 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. He was especially aided by the
        publication in 1962 of Jackson's edition of expeditionary correspondence, which had
        actually created a surge of new scholarship. Since Osgood's work covers only a portion of
        the trip (through the winter of 1804–5) and only a small part of the writing for that time
        (
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes), the additional
        writing and the long, interesting segment from April 1805 to September 1806 is largely
        fallow ground, to be worked here for the first time with modern annotation. A full
        discussion of the transcribing policies and the annotating guidelines adopted for this
        edition is given in the following section, Editorial Procedures. We hope that the new
        edition will foster a broader knowledge and spark a new enthusiasm for the expedition, its
        courageous members, and its accomplishments.</p>

        much later. Jackson may consider the lost notes to be field notes; at one point he uses

        noncommittal." Ibid., 226, headnote. Cutright thinks that the words imply that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had not completed converting his
        field notes into a regular journal. His interpretation of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>letter is that it cannot be
        taken as "
        <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>evidence that he had a journal in form to send to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>." Cutright's wording
        ("journal in form") leaves an opening for supposing field notes, as he does with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>letter. Cutright (LCPN), 120. Only
        one historian has concluded that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>kept no journal, "I do not think
        there is enough available evidence to support a conclusion that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was keeping a journal on the first
        leg of the journey." But even he hesitates over a full commitment and in another instance
        writes, "Field notes . . . must have been taken by both 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during the whole journey." Osgood

            <note xml:id="ngi000042" n="42">It may be significant that September 19 is the date of
        again taking up the weather notations, since it is so near the start of Codex Ba and the

        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was copying the weather data into his
        Codex C, then there may be a case of missing field notes, at least weather remarks, for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>during this period. Because 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>weather diary has so much of

        that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>was the weather recorder and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>the copier. However, one can as

            <note xml:id="ngi000044" n="44">On many occasions the captains copied from each other's
        journals; judging from vocabulary and phrasing, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>most often copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, who was more literate and better
        versed in scientific terminology. Because

        under the same date as it is found in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>journal, we can say with some
        confidence that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>notebook journal entries in 1805
        and 1806 were not always written on the days given. Jackson has shown that after 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>there was a definite
        break in journalizing techniques, so that not only multiple journals but also duplicate
        records of important observations were being kept. Jackson (TJ), 192–95.</note>
            <note xml:id="ngi000045" n="45">Initial times of separation and journal copying include
        the following: April 25–26, 1805, when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>added some notes about 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>activities, which information he
        received after the men reunited; June 4–8, 11–16, 1805, when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>copied from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>journal (Voorhis No. 1) into his
        own (Codex E) under entries on the day they rejoined, suggesting that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was writing day by day in his
        notebook journal; and during the portage around the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the
        Missouri</name>and afterwards when 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>included the "Occurrences with 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>and Party" as part of each
        day's entry (in Codices E and F), indicating that he wrote those individual entries after
        the two reunited. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>explained his procedure in the
        latter instance, for on June 23 he wrote, "I shall on each day give the occurences of both
        camps during our seperation as I afterwards learnt those of the lower camp from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>." He continued this practice
        until they reunited on July 1. Without saying so, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>apparently continued the practice
        while separated from 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, July 10–13, 15–16, 18–22, and
        23–27, 1805. For periods when he was scouting ahead in July 1805, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>gives the courses and distances of
        the main party in Codex G, presumably copying from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>at some time after their reunion.
        Courses and distances are given in blocks of several days, interspersed with several days'
        narrative entries, in a way that suggests 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>went ahead in Codex G to write them,
        leaving space to fill in the narrative material. The latter narrates only his own
        movements, and he may have written them within a few days of their occurrence.</note>

        for the two weeks from the end of Codex Fb (August 26). If so, he surely had notes of some
        kind on which to base the entries. Apparently he never got around to it, and there is no
        sign that he continued after September 10, 1805, at least not in Codex P.</note>

        apparently Number 8 in 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>original numbering system, so he
        must have inserted the note before his collaboration with

        numbering system for cross-references. See Appendix B.</note>
