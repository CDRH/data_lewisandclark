          canoes, and continued until six were made.</p>
               <p>On the 20th and 21st we carried them to the river about a mile and an half distant:
          There I remained with two men to finish them, and to take care of them, until the 26th,
          when some men came up from the fort, and we put the canoes into the water. As the river
          had risen there was some water between the ice and the shore. We got three of them safe
          to the fort; but the ice breaking before the other three were got down, so filled the
          channel, that we were obliged to carry them the rest of the way by land. On the 27th we
          put one of the canoes into the water to ascertain what weight they would carry. We found
          they would not carry as much as was expected, and 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>agreed to take a large
          periogue along. The remainder of the month we were employed in preparing our craft for a
