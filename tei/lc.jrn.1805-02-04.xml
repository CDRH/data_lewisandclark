          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>set out with a hunting party

          <ref target="n09020401" n="1"/>who together with two others, have established a small

             visited by many of the natives today.    our stock of meat which
          we had procured in the Months of November &amp; December is now nearly exhausted; a
          supply of this articles is at this moment peculiarly interesting as well for our
          immediate consumption, as that we may have time before the approach of the warm season
          to prepare the meat for our voyage in the spring of the year. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>therefore deturmined to
          continue his rout down the river even as far as the River bullet unless he should find a
          plenty of game nearer—    The men transported their baggage on a couple of
          small wooden Slays drawn by themselves, and took with them 3 pack horses which we had
          agreed should be returned with a load of meat to fort mandane as soon as they could
          procure it.    no buffaloe have made their appearance in our neighbourhood for
          some weeks [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: time (shorter)</hi>]; and I am informed that our Indian
          neighbours—suffer extreemly at this moment for the article of
