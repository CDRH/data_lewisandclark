               <p>This evening I discovered that my Chronometer had stoped, nor can I assign any cause

          two instances proved to be the same, I have concluded, that whatever this impediment may

          and that when she is in motion, her error on 
          <hi rend="italic">mean time</hi>above stated, may be depended on as accurate. In
          consequence of the chronometer's having thus accedentally stoped, I determined to come
          too at the first convenient place and make such observations as were necessary to
          ascertain her error, establish the Latitude &amp; Longitude, and determine the variation
