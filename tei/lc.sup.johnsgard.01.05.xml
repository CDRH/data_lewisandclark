              Standing Bear only a year later with about 30 of his followers to bury his eldest
              son in an ancestral graveyard led to the entire group's arrest. It produced one of
              the most famous courtroom scenes in American history and raised the remarkable legal
              question as to whether a Native American was a "person" under the meaning of
              then-existing law. The case against Standing Bear was eventually dismissed by the
              Supreme Court, and a restoration of 26,236 acres of
