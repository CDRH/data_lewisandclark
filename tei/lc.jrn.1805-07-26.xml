               <p>Set out early this morning as usual current strong with frequent riffles; employ the
          cord and seting poles.    the oars scarcely ever being used except to pass the
          river in order to take advantage of the shore and current.    at the distance
          of 3¾ m. passed the entrance of a large Creek 15 yds. wide which discharges itself on
          Lard. near the center of a Lard. bend it is a bold runing stream    this we
          called 
          <name type="place" key="Sixteenmile (Howard's) Creek">Howard's Creek</name>after 
          <name type="person" key="Howard, Thomas P.">Thomas P. Howard</name>one of our party.
          <ref target="n17072601" n="1"/>   at the distance of one mile further we
          passed the entrance of a small run which falls in just above a rocky clift on Lard.
          <ref target="n17072602" n="2"/>here the hills or reather mountains again recede from
          the river and the valley again widens to the extent of several miles with wide and
          fertile bottom lands.    covered with grass and in many places a fine terf of
          green-swoard.    the high lands are thin meagre soil covered with dry low
          sedge and a species of grass
          <ref target="n17072603" n="3"/>also dry the seeds of which are armed with a long
          twisted hard beard at the upper extremity while the lower point is a sharp subulate firm
          point beset at it's base with little stiff bristles standing with their points in a
          contrary direction to the subulate point to which they answer as a barb and serve also
          to pres it forward when onece entered a small distance.    these barbed seed
          penetrate our mockersons and leather legings and give us great pain untill they are
          removed.    my poor dog suffers with them excessively, he is constantly
          binting and scratching himself as if in a rack of pain.    the prickly pear
          also grow here as abundantly as usual.    there is another species of the
          prickly pear of a globular form,
          <ref target="n17072604" n="4"/>composed of an assemblage of little conic leaves
          springing from a common root to which their small points are attached as a common center
          and the base of the cone forms the apex of the leaf which is garnished with a circular
          range of sharp thorns quite as stif and more keen than the more common species with the
          flat leaf, like the Cockeneal plant.    on entering this open valley I saw the
          snowclad tops of distant mountains before us.    the timber and mountains much
          as heretofore.    saw a number of beaver today and some otter, killed one of
          the former, also 4 deer; found a deer's skin which had been left by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>with a note informing me of his
          having met with a horse but had seen no fresh appearance of the Indians.   
          the river in the valley is from 2 to 250 yds. wide and crouded with Islands, in some
          places it is ¾ of a mile wide including islands.    were it passed the hills
          it was from 150 to 200 yds. the banks are still low but never overflow.    one
          of the men brought me an indian bow which he found, it was made of cedar and about 2 F.
          9 Inh. in length.    it had nothing remarkable in it's form being much such as
          is used by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetares</name>&amp;c. This morning 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>left 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>at the camp of last evening
          and proceeded up the river about 12 miles to the top of a mountain from whence he had an
          extensive view of the valley of the river upwards and of a large creek which flowed into
          it on Std. side.
          <ref target="n17072605" n="5"/>   not meeting with any fresh appearance of
          Indians he determined to return and examine the 
          <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name>of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name>and meet me by the time he
          expected me to arrive at 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">the forks</name>.
             he returned down the mountain by the way of an old Indian road which led
          through a deep hollow of the mountain facing the south    the day being warm
          and the road unshaded by timber [
          <hi rend="italic">X: in the deep valley</hi>] he suffered excessively with heat and the
          want of water, at length he arrived at a very cold spring, at which he took the
          precaution of weting his feet head and hands before drank but notwithstanding this
          precaution he soon felt the effects of the water.    he felt himself very
          unwell shortly after but continued his march rejoined 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Sharbono</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Fields</name>where the party eat of a fawn which
          
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Jo. Fields</name>had killed in their absence
             
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>was so unwell that he had no
          inclination to eat.    after a short respite he resumed his march pass 
          <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">the North fork</name>at
          a large island; here 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>was very near being
          swept away by the current and cannot swim, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C</name>however risqued him and saved his
          life. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>continued his march to a small
          river which falls into 
          <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">the North
          fork</name>some miles above the junction of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">3 forks</name>it being the
          distance of about four miles from his camp of last evening    here finding
          himself still more unwell he determined to encamp.
          <ref target="n17072606" n="6"/>   they killed two brown or Grisley bear this
          evening on the island where they passed the 
          <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">N. fork of the
          Missouri</name>.    the stream is much divided by islands and it's current

          our course through the mountains. There are some cedar and spruce trees on the shore;
          but very little of any kind on the mountains. About 11 o'clock we got through this range
          into a valley: About 2 came to a large island and halted on it for dinner. A

          <ref target="n17072610" n="10"/>came among our canoes in the water, of a kind different
          from any I had seen. It was about two feet long, of a light colour, with small spots all
          over. One of our hunters went on ahead in the morning, and at this place killed 4 deer.
          While we remained here it became cloudy and some rain fell. At 4 o'clock we proceeded on
          through the valley; passed a creek on the south side,
