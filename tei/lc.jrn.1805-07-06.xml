          as large as musket balls and covered the ground perfectly.    we hand some of
          it collected which kept very well through the day and served to cool our water. These
          showers and gusts keep my boat wet in dispite of my exertions.    she is not
          yet ready for the grease and coal.    after the hail and rain was over this
          morning we dispatched 4 hunters and two canoes to the head of the rappids as we had
          determined last evening.    the
