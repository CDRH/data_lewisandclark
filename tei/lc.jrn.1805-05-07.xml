               <p>A fine morning, set out at an early hour; the drift wood begins to come down in
          consequence of the river's rising; the water is somewhat clearer than usual, a
          circumstance I did not expect on it's rise.    at 11 A. M. the wind became so
          hard that we were compelled to ly by for several hours, one of the small canoes by the
          bad management of the steersman filled with water and had very nearly sunk; we unloaded
          her and dryed the baggage; at one we proceed on the wind having in some measure abated.
             the country we passed today on the North side of the river is one of the
          most beautifull plains we have yet seen, it rises gradually from the river bottom to the
          hight of 50 or 60 feet, then becoming level as a bowling green.    extends
          back as far as the eye can reach; on the S. side the river hills are more broken and
          much higher tho' some little destance back the country becomes level and fertile.
             no appearance of birnt hills coal or pumicestone, that of salts still
          continue.
          <ref target="n13050701" n="1"/>   vegitation appears to have advanced very
          little since the 28th Ulto.—    we continue to see a great number of bald
          Eagles, I presume they must feed on the carcases of dead anamals, for I see no fishing
          hawks
          <ref target="n13050702" n="2"/>to supply them with their favorite food.   
          the water of the river is so terbid that no bird wich feeds exclusively on fish can
          subsist on it; from it's mouth to this place I have neither seen the blue crested fisher
          <ref target="n13050703" n="3"/>nor a fishing hawk.    this day we killed 3
          Buffaloe 1 Elk &amp; 8 beaver; two of the Buffaloe killed by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>near our encampment
          <ref target="n13050704" n="4"/>of this evening wer in good order dressed them and saved
          the meat, the Elk I killed this morning, thought it fat, but on examineation found it so
          lean that we took the tongue marrowbones and Skin only.</p>
