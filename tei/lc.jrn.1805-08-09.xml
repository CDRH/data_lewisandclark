               <p>The morning was fair and fine; we set out at an early hour and proceeded on very
          well.    some parts of the river more rapid than yesterday. I walked on shore
          across the land to a point which I presumed they would reach by 8 A. M. our usual tme of
          halting.    by this means I acquired leasure to accomplish some wrightings
          which I conceived from the nature of my instructions necessary lest any accedent should
          befall me on the long and reather hazardous rout I was now about to take.
          <ref target="n18080901" n="1"/>   the party did not arrive and I returned
          about a mile and met them, here they halted and we breakefasted; I had killed two fine
          gees on my return.    while we halted here 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>arrived, and informed us that
          having missed the party the day on which he set out he had returned the next morning to
          the place from whence he had set out or furst left them and not finding that he had
          supposed that they wer above him; that he then set out and marched one day up wisdom
          river, by which time he was convinced that they were not above him as the river could
          not be navigated; he then returned to the forks and had pursued us up this river.
             he brought the skins of three deer which he had killed which he said were
          in good order. he had lived very plentifully this trip but looked a good deel worried
          <ref target="n18080902" n="2"/>with his march.    he informed us that 
          <name type="place" key="Big Hole (Sensable, Wisdom) River">Wisdom river</name>still kept
          it's course obliquely down 
          <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">the Jefferson's river</name>as far
          as he was up it.    immediately after breakfast I slung my pack and set out
          accompanyed by 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>
                  <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name>who had been previously directed to
          hold themselves in readiness for this service. I directed my course across the bottom to
          the Stard. plain led left 
          <name type="place" key="Beaverhead Rock">the beaver's head</name>about 2 miles to my
          left and interscepted the river about 8 miles from the point at which I had left it; I
          then waded it and continued my rout to the point where I could observe that entered the
          mountain, but not being able to reach that place, changed no direction to the river
          which I struck some miles below the mountain and encamped for the evening having
          traveled 16 M.
          <ref target="n18080903" n="3"/>   we passed a handsom little stream formed by
          some large spring which rise in this wide bottom on the Lard. side of the river.
             we killed two Antelopes on our way and brought with us as much meat as was
          necessary for our suppers and breakfast the next morning.    we found this
          bottom fertile and covered with taller grass than usual.    the river very
          crooked much divided by lands, shallow rocky in many plases and very rapid; insomuch
          that I have my doubts whether the canoes could get on or not, or if they do it must with
          great labour.—    
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>proceeded after I left him as
          usual found the current of the river increasing in rapidity towards evening his hunters
          killed 2 antelopes only.    in the evening it clouded up and experienced a
          slight rain attended with some thunder and lightning the musquetoes very troublesome
          this evening.    there are some soft bogs in these vallies covered with turf.
             the earth of which this mud is composed is white or bluish white and
          appears to be argillacious.

                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 9th.</hi>   We set out at sunrise, and had a fine
          morning with some dew; proceeded on till 9 o'clock when we halted for breakfast. Here
          one of the hunters
          <ref target="n18080906" n="6"/>came to us who had been out since the morning the canoes
          went up the north branch by mistake, and who had that morning proceeded them by land.
          Here also 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and three men
          <ref target="n18080907" n="7"/>started to go on ahead; and at 10 we proceeded on with
          the canoes. The river is narrow and very crooked, and the valley continues about the
          same breadth. There is some timber on the mountain on the south side, and white earth or
          rocks appearing through the pines. At noon we halted for dinner, and hauled out one of
          the canoes, which had sprung a leak and caulked her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 9th August 1805</hi>.    a clear cool morning.
             Several hunters out on Shore    we Set out as usal and proceeded
          on.    the wind high from the S. E.    took on board a goat which
          one of the hunters had killed.    we halted abt. 8 oC. for breakfast.
             
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name>joined us who had been
          lost 3 days.    he had killed 3 buck Deer, which was fat.    he
          brought in the Skins &amp; a little meat.    
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>

          long distance to look out the way for us to go &amp; expect to find the Snake nation of
          Indians.    we proceeded on.    took on bord a deer which one of the
          hunters killed.    we Saw no game worth notice except a fiew deer.
             the River and Smooth prarie the Same as yesterday.    〈back at
          the forks our Captains named this Stream 
          <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">Jeffersons River</name>, the N.

          <ref target="n18080909" n="9"/>and the South fork〉, not known yet.    So I
          expect that ought to be called the head of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missourie</name>although we are yet on the head
          branch, which we expect to See the head of it Soon.    Some Thunder.
             the Musquetoes troublesome.    the beaver pleanty as usal,
          &amp;c.    Saw Snow on the Mountains Some distance a head.   
          proceeded on    passed the old bed of the River where it formerly ran along
          the high land at South Side of the prarie Some cotton trees along it.    the
          prarie low, Some part of which is soft &amp; boggy which we expect is good turf to burn
          was dug &amp; dryed.    Thunder Showers passed round or over.   
          Came 18 miles and Camped on L. S. near a grove of cotton trees &amp; willows.</p>
               <p>Friday August 9th    We had a clear cool morning, several of our Hunters
          left the camp early to go out a hunting &amp; We set out as usual, and proceeded on our
          Voyage, the wind blowing high from the South east, We stopped with one of our Canoes
          &amp; took on board a Goat, which one of the hunters, that went out this morning had
          killed, &amp; left on the bank of the River; we proceeded on till about 8 o'Clock A. M.
          when we halted to take breakfast.    Here we were joined by 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name>, one of our party that
          had been lost, for these 3 days past, he had killed 3 buck Deer, which he said was very
          fat, he brought with him, some of the Meat and the Skins of them.    
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>&amp; 3 of our party
          〈here〉 left us here &amp; set out to go by land a long distance up the River, in order
          to look out the best way for us to proceed, &amp; to find out the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake</name>nation of Indians.—
             We then proceeded on a small distance, &amp; took on board one of the
          Canoes, a Deer which one of the hunters had killed &amp; left on the bank of the River
          also; We saw no Game, excepting a few deer, which were in the bend of the River.
             We passed some smooth plains much the same as those we passed Yesterday.
             We all expect that we are near the head Waters or source of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Mesouri River</name>, as the River, here is
          growing much narrower than it was, We had some thunder in the afternoon, and the
          Musketoes was very toublesome.    The beaver was very plenty to be seen in the
          River, &amp; along the shores.    We saw Snow on the mountains which lay ahead
          of us.—    We continued on our way, and passed a place, where we supposed the
          Bed of the River formerly was, and high land, lying on the South side of the Priaries
          lying back from the River, with some Cotton wood Trees growing on it, The priaries here
          lay low on both sides of the River, some part of which is soft &amp; boggy, which we
          expect would make good turf    In the evening we had some Showers of rain
          accompanied with thunder, We encamped on the South side of the River, near a Grove of
          Cotton wood trees, &amp; Willows, having come 18 Miles this day.—</p>
