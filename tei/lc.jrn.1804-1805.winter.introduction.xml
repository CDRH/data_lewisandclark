            <p>The end of the winter at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>marked an important stage
        in the expedition; difficult and potentially dangerous as the route had so far been, all
        the men's efforts had been directed to reaching a point where other whites had ventured
        before them, on a route already mapped. From 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>on, they would enter
        country for which they had only Indian information and the conjectural maps based on that
        information and on geographical speculation.</p>
            <p>All along the captains had distinguished between their "permanent party" and the
        others, boatmen and soldiers, who would return from some point up the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. The heavy keelboat would become
        less useful as the river became shallower in its upper reaches, while the hired boatmen
        would be less necessary when the keelboat went back. They had designated 
        <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Corporal Richard Warfington's</name>squad
        from the start as the group that would return from some point during the first year
        carrying dispatches and specimens to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>. The original plan
        was that this return party would leave, probably in a pirogue, before the first winter; 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>would thus receive early word
        of the progress of the expedition, would have their first journals to peruse, and would
        receive their first plant, animal, and mineral specimens. Even if disaster later overtook
        the Corps of Discovery, something would be saved to add to knowledge of the West. The
        captains finally decided not to send this return party back before winter, but to wait for
        the following spring.</p>
            <p>Among the items sent back were the journals completed to date; while there may still be
        room for some discussion here (see the 
        <ref n="introduction.v02" type="related">Introduction to vol. 2</ref>), it seems clear
        that most of the daily journal material was 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>, including the Field Notes and
        Codices A, B, and C. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>Codex O, also sent back, is a
        collection of astronomical observations made during the first eleven months of the journey
        and "A Summary view of the Rivers and Creeks, which discharge thems[elves] into the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>. . . ." A more condensed, tabular
        list of rivers, creeks, and "remarkable places" by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>is in Codex C; both men include lists
        of tributaries of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>above 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>and of the 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>, based on Indian
        information. There are also a number of miscellaneous documents that nearly repeat these
        summaries; they are discussed in the pages which follow. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>summaries form 
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part1" type="related">part 1</ref>. A list which identifies 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>points by their modern names is
        also a part of this section.</p>
            <p>Some of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>observations (such as astronomical
        notes and weather data) are dated and can be placed in the journals by date, as is done in
        this edition. Many of the other miscellaneous materials, however, cannot be dated with any
        precision, except that they clearly belong to the period ending with the departure from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. For this reason they
        appear together as a miscellany of observations covering the first phase of the expedition
        and sent back from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. One such item is an
        extensive separate document by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>listing and describing Indian tribes
        east of the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</name>, his "
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part2" type="related">Estimate of Eastern Indians</ref>." From
        this, supplemented by other journal material, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>prepared "A Statistical View
        of the Indian Nations Inhabiting the Territory of Louisiana and the Countries Adjacent to
        its Northern and Western Boundaries," which he presented to Congress and which was
        published in 1806. Again miscellaneous documents duplicate this material and they are
        discussed below. The Indian material, along with a list identifying the tribes by modern
        designation, makes up 
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part2" type="related">part 2</ref>.</p>
            <p>On the trip to 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>took extensive notes on the fauna
        and flora of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>valley. These he copied into
        special notebooks, Codices Q and R. The zoological material in Codex Q is placed in these
        volumes by date, as are astronomical and weather data. The botanical information from
        Codex R presents a different situation. The material is presented in the journal as a
        list, similar to the captains' summaries of rivers and creeks. Moreover, since many of the
        items are undated they appeared more appropriate for this section. Botanical specimens
        that were sent back from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>with 
        <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Warfington's</name>party were eventually
        received by the American Philosophical Society and are listed in the Donation Book there. 
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part3" type="related">Part 3</ref>contains the lists from Codex
        R and the Donation Book. Since so many of these plants are not mentioned in the captains'
        daily journals, a table has been added to match the lists and to give modern
        identifications of the plants as far as possible.</p>
            <p>A list of mineral specimens sent back from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>is also a part of the
        Donation Book, apparently a copy of a list prepared by the captains themselves, done by
        persons at the society. It appears as 
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part4" type="related">part 4</ref>. 
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part5" type="related">Part 5</ref>is a section of miscellaneous
        items that were apparently drawn up at 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, while 
        <ref n="1804-1805.winter.part6" type="related">part 6</ref>is lists of Indian presents
        and "necessary stores" for the expedition from Codex C.</p>
