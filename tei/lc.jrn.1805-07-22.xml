               <p>We set out early as usual. The river being divided into such a number of channels by
          both large and small Island that I found it impossible to lay it down correctly
          following one channel only in a canoe and therefore walked on shore took the general
          courses of the river and from the rising grounds took a view of the Islands and it's
          different channels which I laid don in conformity thereto on my chart.   
          there being but little timber to obstruct my view I could see it's various meanders very
          satisfactorily. I passed though a large island which I found a beautifull level and
          fertile plain about 10 feet above the surface of the water and never overflown.
             on this Island I [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: We</hi>] met with great quantities of a smal onion
          <ref target="n17072201" n="1"/>about the size of a musquit ball and some even larger;
          they were white crisp and well flavored    I geathered about half a bushel of
          them before the canoes arrived. I halted the party for breakfast and the men also
          geathered considerable quantities of those onions.    it's seed had just
          arrived to maturity and I gathered a good quantity of it. This appears to be a valuable
          plant inasmuch as it produces a large quantity to the squar foot and bears with ease the
          rigor of this climate, and withall I think it as pleasantly flavored as any species of
          that root I ever tasted. I called this beatifull and fertile island after this plant 
          <name type="place" key="Onion Island">Onion Island</name>.    here I passed
          over to the stard. shore where the country was higher and ascended the river to the
          entrance of a large creek which discharges itself into the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>on the Stard. side.   
          it is composed of three pretty considerable creeks which unite in a beautifull and
          extensive vally a few miles before it discharges itself into the river.
          <ref target="n17072202" n="2"/>   while wateing for the canoes to arrive I
          killed an otter which sunk to the bottom on being shot, a circumstance unusual with that
          anamal.    the water was about 8 feet deep yet so clear that I could see it at
          the bottom; I swam in and obtained it by diving. I halted the party here for dinner; the
          canoes had taken different channels through these islands and it was sometime before
          they all came up. I placed my thermometer in a good shade as was my custom about 4 P. M.
          and after dinner set out without it and had proceeded near a mile before I recollected
          it    I sent 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>back for it, he found it and
          brought it on.    the murcury stood at 80 a. 0    this is the
          warmest day except one which we have experienced this summer.

          the hills come close to the river. At breakfast our squaw informed us she had been at
          this place before when small. Here we got a quantity of wild onions. At half past 9, we

          and had fled, taking us for enemies. We went 17 miles and an half and encamped on an
          island; where we found the musquitoes very bad. We saw to day several banks of snow on a
          mountain west of us.

          few trees growing on it, We found growing along the shores of the River, a great
          quantity of Currants; We took into a narrow Channell, of the River which run behind an
          Island, which was about 5 Miles through, Our party began to think before we had passed
          through this Channel, that we had taken the wrong River, For The whole of these 5 Miles,
          〈had〉 we saw a number of Islands lying a small distance from each other, 2 of which was
          very large.    They lay very level and were all Priaries.—    We
          were all well pleased when we passed the last of these Islands, and found that we
          entered into the River, which appear'd the same as when we took this Channel, One of our
