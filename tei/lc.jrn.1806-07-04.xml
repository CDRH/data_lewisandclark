          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name>; he had pursued us a few
          days after our departure and overtook us at this place; he proved to be the same young
          man who had first attempted to pass the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>early in June last when
          we lay on the 
          <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Kooskooske</name>and
          was obliged to relinquish the enterprize in consequence of the debth and softness of the
          snow. I gave a shirt a handkercheif and a small quantity of ammunition to the indians.
             at half after eleven the hunters returned from the chase unsuccessfull. I
          now ordered the horses saddled smoked a pipe with these friendly people and at noon bid
          them adieu.    they had cut the meat which I gave them last evening thin and
          exposed it in the sun to dry informing me that they should leave it in this
          neighbourhood untill they returned as a store for their homeward journey.   
          it is worthy of remark that these people were about to return by the same pass by which
          they had conducted us through the difficult part of the

          these affectionate people our guides betrayed every emmotion of unfeigned regret at
          seperating from us; they said that they were confidint that the

          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Minnetares</name>) would cut us off.
             the first 5 miles of our rout was through a part of the extensive plain in
          which we were encamped, we then entered the mountains with the 
          <name type="place"
                        key="Clark Fork (Clark's, East Fork Clark's, Flathead) River">East

          the banks bold not very high but never overflow.    the East fork below its
          junction with this stream is 100 yds. wide and above it about 90.    the water
          of boath are terbid but the East branch much the most so; their beds are composed of
          sand and gravel; the East fork possesses a large portion of the former.   
          neither of those streams are navigable in consequence of the rapids and shoals which
          obstruct their currents.    thus far a plain or untimbered country bordered
          the river which near the junction of these streams spread into a handsome level plain of
          no great extent; the hills were covered with long leafed pine and fir. I now continued
          my rout up the N. side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Blackfoot (East Fork Clark's) River">Cokahlahishkit
          river</name>through a timbered country for 8 miles and encamped in a handsom bottom on
          the river where there was an abundance of excelence grass for our horses.   
          the evening was fine, air pleasent and no musquetoes.    a few miles before we
          encamped I killed a squirrel of the speceis common to the

          crossed the mountains after us. At 10 o'clock our hunters came in, but had not killed
          any thing. We were, however, able to furnish them with two deer and a half, from those
          that were killed yesterday. We then gave them some presents, and took a friendly leave
          of them: and it is but justice to say, that the whole nation to which they belong, are
          the most friendly, honest and ingenuous people that we have seen in the course of our
