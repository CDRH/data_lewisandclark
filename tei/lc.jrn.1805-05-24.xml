          the ballance of the day to employ our sails to advantage; we proceed at a pretty good
          pace notwithstanding the courant of the river was very strong.    we passed
          two large and four small Islands; also several streams on either side; the first of

          country that mountains and other elivated objects appear much nearer than they really

          than we found them at any place lower down. The water is high, rapid and more clear. At
          dinner time a party was sent out to bring the meat of some animals that had been killed
          at a distance. Here we left two canoes to wait for them and proceeded on. We passed a
