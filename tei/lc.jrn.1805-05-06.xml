               <p>The morning being fair and pleasant and wind favourable we set sale at an early hour,
          and proceeded on very well the great part of the day; the country still continues level
          fertile and beautifull, the bottoms wide and well timbered comparitively speaking with
          other parts of the river; no appearance of birnt hills pumice stone or coal, the salts
          of tartar or vegitable salts continues to appear on the river banks, sand bars and in
          many parts of the plains most generally in the little revines at the base of the low
          hills.
          <ref target="n13050601" n="1"/>   passed three streames today which
          discharged themselves on the Lard. side; the first of these we call 
          <name type="place" key="Spring (Little Dry) Creek (McCone County, Mont.)">little dry
          creek</name>   it contained some water in standing pools but discharged none,
          the 2ed 50 yards wide no Water, we called it 
          <name type="place" key="Sand (Big Dry) Creek (McCone County, Mont.)">Big dry
          Creek</name>, the 3rd is bed of a conspicuous river 200 yards wide which we called 
          <name type="place" key="Prairie Elk Creek (Little Dry River)">little dry river</name>;
          <ref target="n13050602" n="2"/>the banks of these streams are low and bottoms wide with
          but little timber, their beds are almost entirely formed of a fine brown sand intermixed
          with a small proportion of little pebbles, which were either transparent, white, green,
          red, yellow or brown.    these streams appeared to continue their width
          without diminution as far as we could perceive them, which with rispect to the river was
          many miles, they had recenly discharged their waters.    from the appearance
          of these streams, and the country through which they passed, we concluded that they had
          their sources in level low dry plains, which probably is the character of the country
          for a great distance west of this, or to the vicinity of the 
          <name type="place" key="Black Hills">black hills</name>, that the country being low on
          the same leve[l] nearly and in the same parallel of latitude, that the rains in the
          spring of the year 〈in a few days〉 suddonly melts the snow at the same time and causes
          for a few days a vast quantity of water which finds it's way to the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>through those channels; by
          reference to the diary of the weather &amp;c it will be percieved that there is scarcely
          any rain during the summer Autumn and winter in this open country distant from the
          mountains. Fields still continues unwell.    saw a brown bear swim the river
          above us, he disappeared before we can get in reach of him; I find that the curiossity
          of our party is pretty well satisfyed with rispect to this anamal, the formidable
          appearance of the male bear killed on the 5th added to the difficulty with which they
          die when even shot through the vital parts, has staggered the resolution several of
          them, others however seem keen for action with the bear; I expect these gentlemen will
          give us some amusement shotly as they soon begin now to coppolate.    saw a
          great quantity of game of every species common here. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>walked on shore and killed two
          Elk, they were not in very good order, we therefore took a part of the meat only; it is
          now only amusement for 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>and myself to kill as much meat
          as the party can consum; I hope it may continue thus through our whole rout, but this I
          do not much expect.    two beaver were taken in traps this morning and one
          since shot by one of the party.    saw numbers of these anamals peeping at us
          as we passed out of their wholes which they form of a cilindric shape, by burrowing in
          the face of the abbrupt banks of the river.</p>
