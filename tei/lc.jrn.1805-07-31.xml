This morning I waited at my camp very impatiently for the arrival of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and party; I observed by my watch that it was 7 A. M. and they had not come in sight. I now became very uneasy and determined to wait until 8 and if they did not arrive by that time to proceed on up the river taking it as a fact that they had passed my camp some miles last evening.    just as I set out to pursue my plan I discovered <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> walking up shore some distance below me and waited untill arrived    I now learnt that the canoes were behind, they arrived shortly after.    their detention had been caused by the rapidity of the water and the circuitous rout of the river.    they halted and breakfasted after which we all set out again and I continued my walk on the Stard. shore    the river now becomes more collected    the islands tho' numerous ar generally small.    the river continues rapid and is from 90 to 120 yd. wide has a considerable quantity of timber in it's bottoms.    towards evening the bottoms became much narrower and the timber much more scant.    high hills set in close on the Lard. and the plain high waivy or reather broken on the Stard. and approach the river closely for a shot distance vally above 1½ M wd.    About one mile above <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name> encampment of the last evening the principall entrance of a considerable river discharges itself into <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson's river</name>.    this stream is a little upwards of 30 yd. wide discharges a large quantity of very clear water it's bed like that of <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson's river</name> is pebble and gravel.    it takes it's rise in the snowclad mountains between <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">Jefferson's</name> and <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">Madison's</name> Rivers to the S. W. and discharges itself into the former by seven mouths it has some timber in it's bottoms and vas numbers of beaver and Otter.<ref target="n18073101" n="1"/>    This stream we call <name type="place"
                        key="Willow Creek (Philosophy River) (Gallatin County, Mont.)">River Philosophy</name>.<ref target="n18073102" n="2"/>    the rock of the clifts this evening is a hard black grannite like that of the clifts of most parts of the river below the limestone clifts at the <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">3 forks of the Missouri</name>.<ref target="n18073103" n="3"/> this evening just before we encamped <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> discovered a brown bear enter a small cops of bushes on the Lard. side; we surrounded the place an surched the brush but he had escaped in some manner unperceived but how we could not discover.    nothing killed today and our fresh meat is out.    when we have a plenty of fresh meat I find it impossible to make the men take any care of it, or use it with the least frugallity.    tho' I expect that necessity will shortly teach them this art.    the mountains on both sides of the river at no great distance are very lofty.    we have a lame crew just now, two with tumers or bad boils on various parts of them, one with a bad stone bruise, one with his arm accedently dislocated but fortunately well replaced, and a fifth has streigned his back by sliping and falling backwards on the gunwall of the canoe.    the latter is <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Gass</name>. it gives him great pain to work in the canoe in his present situation, but he thinks he can walk with convenience, I therefore scelected him as one of the party to accompany me tomorrow, being determined to go in quest of the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake</name> Indians. I also directed <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name> and <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> to hold themselves in readiness. <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name> thinks that his ankle is sufficiently recovered to stand the march but I entertain my doubts of the fact; he is very anxious to accompany me and I therefore indulge him. There is some pine<ref target="n18073104" n="4"/> on the hills on both sides of the river opposite to our encampment which is on the Lard. side upon a small island just above a run.    the bull rush &amp; Cat-tail flag<ref target="n18073105" n="5"/> grow in great abundance in the moist parts of the bottoms    the dryer situations are covered with fine grass, tanzy, thistles, onions and flax.<ref target="n18073106" n="6"/>    the bottom land fertile and of a black rich loam.    the uplands poor sterile and of a light yellow clay with a mixture of small smooth pebble and gravel,<ref target="n18073107" n="7"/> poducing prickley pears, sedge and the bearded grass in great abundance;<ref target="n18073108" n="8"/> this grass is now so dry that it would birn like tinder.—    we saw one bighorn<ref target="n18073109" n="9"/> today as a few antelopes and deer.—</p>

Wednesday July 31st    About 10 o'Clock last night, the hunters that were out came to our Camp, and had left <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, who staid out, all night, We had a fine morning and set out at sunrise; and proceeded on our Voyage;  we found the current of the River running strong against us, we passed the Mouth of a large creek which lay on the South side of the River [<hi rend="italic">erasure</hi>] which was damed up in many places by the Beaver, We passed also by low bottomed land, lying on both sides of the River, which was cover'd with small Cotton wood timber, Willows, &amp;ca—.    About 8 o'Clock A. M. we arrived at the place where <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> was &amp; had encamped last night.    We halted at this place and breakfasted.    We then proceeded on, and passed a 
plain lying on the South side of the River.    The hills near to this plain begin to make in near the River, on both sides of it.    We also passed a very large Island, which lay low, and mostly Priari land, and but little Timber, on it; On 
the South side of the River opposite to this Island is a large open plain, having a handsome Creek,<ref target="n18073116" n="16"/> running through it.—    On this plaine we found growing, abundance of Wild flax, Tanzey, thistles &amp; wild flowers, and had grass growing luxuriently on it, There was some timber likewise at this place which grew near the River.    We dined at that place under a delightful grove of cotton timber, which lies a small distance from a Mountain; which had 
large heaps of Snow lying on it.—    We proceeded on about One Mile when we passed hills, lying on both sides of the River, which keeps along under the mountains, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> saw a Mountain Sheep (or Ibex) with his spy Glass, on a round hill towards the Mountain; We found the Game getting very scarce, &amp; we are now without fresh meat, which was very uncommon with us.    This day proved very warm; We continued on our way, and passed clifts of Rocks, and high Walls of Stone lying along the Shores on both sides of the River.—    We saw growing along the hills sides on each side of the River some scattering pine trees.    We encamped in the Evening on a small Island, lying on the South side of the River, having came this day 17¾ Miles.    Our hunters that were on Shore wounded a White or Brown bear, but it made its escape.
