               <p>Tuesday 8th July 1806.    a clear cold morning &amp; hard frost.
             we Set out eairly with our horses and proceed. on over this large extensive
          plains.    crossed Several large creeks    Saw elk &amp; deers and
          goats or antelopes.    our course abt. South    Struck the trail of
          the party    at about 12 miles we come to a boiling hot Spring
          <ref target="n37070818" n="18"/>at the edge of this plains which is large and handsom
             we halted a fiew minutes at this Spring    found a peace of
          vinison in it well boiled which we expect the party left for us.    we eat it.
          I drank Some of the water found it well tasted but So hot
          <ref target="n37070819" n="19"/>that I cannot hold my hand in a Second of time.
             it fairly boils out of the ground in Sundry places &amp;C.    we
          proceeded on    crossd a creek
          <ref target="n37070820" n="20"/>near Sd. Springs and kept our course abt. South up a
          creek on which Saw many beaver dams &amp;C.    about noon we dined at the head
          of the creek near the dividing ridge.
          <ref target="n37070821" n="21"/>   then crossd the ridge about one mile and
          came on a creek running South, which we expect is a branch of 
          <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">jeffersons
          river</name>   followed down it 10 or 12 mls. and crossed an other ridge and
          came in the valley &amp; on the east fork of 
          <name type="place" key="Beaverhead (Jefferson) River">jeffersons river</name>.
             followed down on the trail of the party a Short distance and Camped
          <ref target="n37070822" n="22"/>at dark on the branch of the creek.   
          hobbled the unruley horses and lay down to Sleep fatigued rideing upwards of 40 miles
          this day.    and nothing to eat this evening but the head of a goat or
          antelope which the party had droped on the road.—</p>
