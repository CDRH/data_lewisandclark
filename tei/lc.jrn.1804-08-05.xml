               <p>Set out early    great appearance of wind and rain    (I have
          observed that Thundor &amp; lightning is not as common in this Countrey as it is in the
          atlantic States)    Snakes are not plenty, one was killed to day large and
          resembling the rattle Snake only Something lighter—.    I walked on Shore this
          evening S. S.    in Pursueing Some Turkeys I [s]truck the river twelve miles
          below within 370 yards, the high water passes thro this Peninsulia; and agreeable to the
          Customary Changes of the river I Concld. [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: Should Calculate</hi>] that in two years the main Current of the
          river will pass through. In every bend the banks are falling in from the Current being
          thrown against those bends by the Sand points which inlarges and the Soil I believe from
          unquestionable appearns. of the entire bottom from one hill to the other being the mud
          or ooze of the River at Some former Period mixed with Sand and Clay easily melts and
          Slips into the River, and the mud mixes with the water &amp; the Sand is washed down and
          lodges on the points—    Great quantities of Grapes on the banks, I observe
          three different Kinds at this time ripe, one Of the no. is large &amp; has the flaver of
          the Purple grape.

          called the cow or bull snake from a bellowing nois which it is said sometimes to make

          them make that or any other noise myself.—</p>
               <p>I have frequently observed an acquatic bird [
          <hi rend="italic">EC: sterna antillarum</hi>] in the cours of asscending this river but
          have never been able to procure one before today, this day I was so fortunate as to kill
          two of them, they are here more plenty than on the river below.    they lay
          their eggs on the sand bars without shelter or nest, and produce their young from the
          15th to the last of June, the young ones of which we caught several are covered with
          down of a yellowish white colour and on the back some small specks of a dark brown.
             they bear a great resemblance to the young quale of ten days oald, and
          apear like them to be able to runabout and peck their food as soon as they are hatched—
             this bird, lives on small fish, worms and bugs which it takes on the virge
          of the water    it is seldom seen to light on trees an qu[i]te as seldom do
          they lite in the water and swim tho' the foot would indicate that they did it's being
          webbed    I believe them to be a native of this country and probly a constant
          resident.—</p>
               <p>the weight of the male bird is one ounce and a half, it[s] [l]ength from b[e]ak to
          toe 7½ inches    from tip to tip of wing across the back one foot seven inches
          and a half    [the beak] is one ⅛ inch lonong, large where it joins the head
          flated on the sides and tapering to a sharp point, a little declining and curvated, a
          fine yellow, with a shade of black on the extremity of upper beak; the eye is prominent,
          black and on a angular scale of ½ Inc; occupyse 3⅓ in width.    the upper part
          of the head is black from the beak as low as the middle of the eye and a little below
          the joinging of the neck except however some white which joins the upper part of the
          beak 〈and extends〉 which forks and passing over the sides of the forehead terminate
          above each eye—    the under part of the bird, that is the thr[o]at and cheeks
          as high as the eye, the neck brest belly and under part of the wings and tail are of a
          fine white, the upper part of the neck, back, and wings are of a fine, quaker colour, or
          bright dove colour with reather more of a bluish tint—except however the three first or
          larger feathers in the wing which on upper side are of a deep black.    the
