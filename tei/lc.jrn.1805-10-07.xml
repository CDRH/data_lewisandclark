          and a chief &amp; one more Indian who agreed to go down with us has gone by land Some
          distance down and then Intends comming on board.    we proceeded on over a
          nomber of bad rapids where the canoes run fast and obledged us to git out in the cold
          water and hale them off.    Some places the water is deep &amp; current gentle
          for Some distance, but the Shole rapids are common &amp; rockey.    the River
          hills make close to the River on each Side.    Some clifts of rocks, a fiew
          Scattering pine trees on the hills, but they are mostly barron broken, &amp; covred over
          with grass.    Some Small cotton wood along the Shores.    Some of
          the rapids which are deep enofe to run clear are So bad that we take water over the
          canoes by the waves.    Strike Some large rocks &amp; Slide of without
          Injury—.    Came 21 miles and Camped on Stard. Side    the officers
          canoe leaks So that they changes their Baggag in an other canoe for fear of gitting the
          Instruments &amp;c. wet.    the Evening cloudy.    one man taken
          Sick with the collick.    we passed Some old Indian Camps this afternoon &amp;
          a Small canoe on Shore—</p>
               <p>Monday October 7th    This morning we had clear pleasant weather, all our
          party that were able were employed in getting the other three new Canoes into the River,
          which they effected.    they got every thing in readiness on board of them and
          got them loaded.    About 3 oClock P. M. we set out on our way to descend the
          River, &amp; the 2 Indians of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake</name>Nation, that came to Pilot
          us across the Mountains, agreed to continue with us.    We also had a chief
          &amp; one Indian from the last Town we came through who also agreed to accompany us.—
             These two last Indians, set off down the River by land to go some distance,
          &amp; intend to join our party again.    We then proceeded on our Voyage, and
          crossed a number of bad rapids, where our Canoes got fast, &amp; obliged us to get out
          in the Water (that was cold) and hawl them off.    we found the Water in some
          places deep, &amp; the current running gentle for some distance.    The Rapids
          were very frequent &amp; Shoal, the bottom of the River rockey, and the hills making
          close in to the River on both sides of it.    There is some Clifts of rocks,
          lying along the Shore &amp; a few scattering pine trees, growing on some of the hills
          〈but they〉 which are mostly broken &amp; covered with grass.    We saw some
          few cotton wood Trees, growing on each side of the River along the Shore, We also found,
          that in some of the Rapids where we had plenty of water for our Canoes to pass, that the
          Waves ran so high that our Canoes took in a great deal of water, &amp; we struck several
          Rocks, in passing over them, but the Rapidity of the stream forced us over them.—</p>
               <p>We came about 27 Miles this day, and encamped on the North side of the River.
             The Canoe that our Officers went in, leaked so bad, that they were forced
          to unload it, &amp; put their baggage into another Canoe, for fear of getting their
          Mathematical Instruments &amp; baggage wet.    We passed this afternoon some
          old Indian Camps &amp; saw a Canoe lying on the Shore.    The Evening proved
          cloudy.    One of our party was taken ill, this evening of a Cholic occasioned
          by being so much in the water.</p>
