          each of the Indians a pair of mockasons, and they agreed to stay to day and wait for the
          party.— One of our hunters went out, but had no success. The day keeps cloudy, and the
          musquitoes are very troublesome. There is also a small black fly
          <ref target="n36062404" n="4"/>in this country, that so torments our horses, that they
          can get no rest, but when we make small fires to keep them off. At noon two hunters
          <ref target="n36062405" n="5"/>went on ahead to a small creek, to endeavour to kill
          some provision, as we cannot kill any here; and unless the party come up to night, I
          intend to go on with the Indians tomorrow morning. In the evening the party arrived with
          three more Indians, and we all encamped together for the night.</p>
