               <p>We arrose very early this morning, assigned the canoes their loads and had it put on
          board.    we now found our vessels eight in number all heavily laden,
          notwithstanding our several deposits; tho' it is true we have now a considerable stock
          of dryed meat and grease.    we find it extreemly difficult to keep the
          baggage of many of our men within reasonable bounds; they will be adding bulky articles
          of but little use or value to them. At 10 A. M. we once more saw ourselves fairly under
          way much to my joy and I beleive that of every individual who compose the party. I
          walked on shore and killed 2 Elk near one of which the party halted and dined.
             we took the skins marrow bones and a part of the flesh of these Elk.
             in order to lighten the burthen of the canoes I continued my walk all the
          evening and took our only invalledes 
          <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name>an 
          <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">LaPage</name>with me.    we
          passed the river near where we dined and just above the entrance of a beautifull river
          80 yards wide which falls in on the Lard. side which in honour of 
          <name type="person" key="Smith, Robert">Mr. Robert Smith</name>the Secretary of the Navy
          we called 
          <name type="place" key="Smith River">Smith's River</name>.
          <ref target="n17071501" n="1"/>   this stream meanders through a most lovely
          valley to the S. E. for about 25 miles when it enters the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name>and is concealed from our
          view.    many herds of buffaloe were feeding in this valley.    we
          again crossed the river to the Stard. side and passed through a plain and struck the
          river at a Northwardly bend where there was timber    here we waited untill
          the canoes arrived by which time it was so late that we concluded to encamp for the
          night.
          <ref target="n17071502" n="2"/>   here 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>wouded a deer which ran into
          the river    
          <name type="person" key="Seaman">my dog</name>pursued caught it drowned it and brought
          it to shore at our camp.    we have now passed 
          <name type="place" key="Square Butte (Fort Mountain)">Fort Mountain</name>on our right
          it appears to be about ten miles distant.    this mountain has a singular
          appearance    it is situated in a level plain, it's sides stand nearly at
          right angles with each other and are each about a mile in extent.    these are
          formed of a yellow clay only without the mixture of rock or stone of any size and rise
          perpendicularly to the hight of 300 feet.    the top appears to be a level
          plain and from the eminence on which I was yesterday I could see that it was covered
          with a similar cost of grass with the plain on which it stands.    the surface
          appears also to possess a tolerable fertile mole [mold] of 2 feet thick, and is to all
          appearance inaccessible.    from it's figure we gave it the name of 
          <name type="place" key="Square Butte (Fort Mountain)">fort mountain</name>.
          <ref target="n17071503" n="3"/>   those mounds before mentioned near the
          falls have much the same apeparance but are none of them as large as this one.
             the prickly pear is now in full blume and forms one of the beauties as well
          as the greatest pests of the plains.    the sunflower is also in blume and is
          abundant.
          <ref target="n17071504" n="4"/>   this plant is common to every part of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>from it's entrance to this place.
             the lambsquarter, wild coucumber, sand rush and narrow dock are also common
          here.

                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>killed another deer and an
          Otter today.    we find it inconvenient to take all the short meanders of the
          river which has now become cooked and much narrower than below, we therefore take it's
          general course and lay down the small bends by the eye on our daily traverse or chart.
             the river is from 100 to 150 yds. wide.    more timber on the
          river than below 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>for a great
          distance.    on the banks of the river there are many large banks of sand much
          elivated above the plains on which they ly and appear as if they had been collected in
          the course of time from the river by the almost incessant S. W. winds; they always
          appear on the sides of the river opposite to those winds.—</p>
