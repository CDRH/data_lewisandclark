               <p>Had frequent showers in the course of the last night. 
          <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>set out to hunt on the high lands
          some distance up on the N. E. side of 
          <name type="place" key="Lolo (Collins's) Creek (Idaho)">Collins's Creek</name>. The
          Clyster given the Child last evening operated very well.    it is clear of
          fever this evening and is much better, the swelling is considerably abated and appears
          as if it would pass off without coming to a head.    we still continue fresh
          poltices of onions to the swolen part.    we directed the indians in what
          manner to treat the dieased Cheif, gave him a few dozes of flour of sulpher and Creem of
          tartar &amp; some portable soupe and directed them to take him home.    they
          seemed unwilling to comply with the latter part of the injunction for they consumed the
          day and remained with us all night.    at 1 P. M. 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Feilds</name>returned, accompanyed by 
          <name type="person" key="Hohots Ilppilp">Hohâstillpilp</name>several other inferior
          Cheifs and some young men. These hunters informed us they were unable to reach the
          grounds to which they had been directed in consequence of the debth and rapidity of a
          large creek which falls in about 10 Ms. above. they passed 
          <name type="place" key="Lawyer (Commearp) Creek">Commearp Creek</name>at about 1½ Ms.
          and a second creek reather larger at 3 Ms. further.
          <ref target="n35052601" n="1"/>   at the distance of 4 Ms. up this last creek
          on their return they called at a village which our traders have never yet visited, here
          they obtained a large quantity of bread and roots of Cows on very moderate terms.
             we permitted 
          <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Sergt. Pryor</name>and four men to pass
          the river tomorrow morning with a view to visit this village    we also
          directed 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>
                  <name type="person" key="York">York</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">LePage</name>to set out early for the
          same place and procure us some roots.    our meat is again exhausted, we
          therefore directed 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>to hunt the horse in the morning
          which the Indians have given us to kill.    one of our men saw a salmon in the
          river today.    in the afternoon we compleated our canoe and put her in the
          water; she appears to answer very well and will carry about 12 persons.—   
          the river still rising fast and snows of the mountains visibly diminish</p>

          place on the opposit side above at which place they precured roots on very reasonable
          terms.    they Could not proceed higher up to hunt as the creeks were too high
          for them to Cross, &amp;c.    we gave permission to 
          <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Serjt. Pryor</name>and 4 men to cross
          the river and trade with nativs of the village the
