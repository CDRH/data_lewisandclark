               <p>Nothing transpired today worthy of notice.    we are agreeable disappointed
          in our fuel which is altogether green pine.    we had supposed that it burn
          but illy, but we have found that by spliting it that it burns very well. The dress of
          the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clatsops</name>and others in this
          neighbourhood differs but little from the discribed of the skillutes; they never wear
          leggins or mockersons which the mildness of this climate I presume has rendered in a
          great measure unnecessary; and their being obliged to be frequently in the water also
          renders those articles of dress inconvenient.    they wear a hat of a conic
          figure without a brim confined on the head by means of a stri[n]g which passes under the
          chin and is attatched to the two opsite sides of a secondary rim within the hat.
             the hat at top terminates in a pointed knob of a connic form also, or in
          this shape.
          <ref target="n28013001" n="1"/>   these hats are made of the bark of cedar
          and beargrass wrought with the fingers so closely that it casts the rain most
          effectually in the shape which they give them for their own uce or that just discribed.
             on these hats they work various figures of different colours, but most
          commonly only black and white are employed.    these figures are faint
          representations of whales the canoes and the harpoonneers striking them.   
          sometimes squares dimonds triangles &amp;c. The form of knife which seems to be prefered
          by these people is a double edged and double pointed daggar; the handle being in the
          middle, and the blades of unequal lengths, the longest usually from 9 to ten inches
          〈long〉 and the shorter one from four to five. these knives they carry with them
          habitually and most usually in the hand, somtimes exposed but most usually particularly
          when in company with strangers, under their robes    with this knife they cut
          and lense their fish make their arrows &amp;c.    this is somewhat the form of
          the knife—
          <ref target="n28013002" n="2"/>   A is a small loop of a strong twine through
          which they sometimes insert the thumb in order to prevent it's being wrested from their
          hand.</p>

          <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clatsops</name>and others of the nativs
          in the neighbourhood differ but little from that described of the

               <p>The 
          <hi rend="italic">Sac-a commis</hi>is the groth of high dry Situations, and invariably
          in a piney Country, or on its border; it is Generally found in the open piney woodlands
          as on the Western Side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name>but in this neighbourhood
          we find it in the praries or on the borders in the more open woodland's; a very rich
          Soil is not absolutely necessary, as a meager one frequently produces it abundantly.
             the nativs on the West side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name>who can precure this
          berry invariably use it; to me it is a very tasteless and insipid frute. This Shrub is
          an evergreen, the leaves retain their virdue most perfectly throughout the winter even
          in the most rigid climate as on 
          <name type="place" key="Lake Winnipeg">Lake Winnipic</name>.    the root of
          this shrub puts foth a great number of Stems, which seperate near the surface of the
          ground; each Stem from the size of a Small quill, to that of a mans finger. These are
          much branched forming an accute angle with the Stem, and all more properly procumbent
          than crossing, for altho' it sometimes puts foth radicles from the Stems and branches
          which Strike obliquely into the ground, those radicles are by no means general, equable
          in their distances from each other nor do they appear to be calculated to furnish
          nutriment to the plant but rather to hold the Stem or branch in its place.   
          the bark is formed of several thin layers of a Smothe thin brittle substance of a redish
          brown colour easily seperated from the woody Stem in flakes.    the leaves
          with respect to their possition are scatter'd yet closely arranged near the extremities
          of the twigs particularly.    the leaves are about ¾ of an inch in length and
          about half that in width, is oval but obtusely pointed, absolutely entire, thick, Smoth,
          firm, a deep green and slightly grooved. the leaf is Supported by a Small footstalk of
          preportionable length.    the berry is attached in an irregular and Scattered
          manner to the Small boughs among the leaves, tho' frequently Closely arranged, but
          always Supported by a Seperate Short and Small peduncles, the incersion of which
          produces a Small concavity in the berry while its opposit side is Slightly convex; the
          form of the berry is a Spheroid, the Shorter diameter being in a line with the peduncle
          or Stem—.    this berry is a pericarp the outer Coat of which is a thin firm
          tough pellicle, the inner part consists of dry mealy powder of a yellowish white colour
          invelloping from four to six propotionably large hard light brown seeds each in the form
          of section of a spheroid which figure they form when united, and are distitute of any
          membranous covering.—    the colour of this fruit is a fine scarlet.
             the nativs usually eat them without any preparation.    the fruit
          ripens in September and remains on the bushes all winter.    the frost appears
          to take no effects on it.    these berries are Sometimes gathered and hung in
          their houses in bags where they dry without further trouble, for in their succulent
          State they appear to be almost as dry as flour.</p>
