A fair morning    made the above observations during which time the principal Chief came down with Several of his principal men and Smoked with us. Several men and woman offered Dogs and fish to Sell, we purchased all the dogs we could, the fish being out of Season and dieing in great numbers in the river, we did not think prper to use them, Send out Hunters to Shute the Prarie Cock a large fowl which I have only Seen on this river; Several of which I have killed, they are the Size of a Small turkey, of the pheasant kind, one I killed on the water edge to day measured from the Beek to the end of the toe 2 feet 6 &amp; ¾ Inches; from the extremities of its wings 3 feet 6 inches; the tale feathers is 13 inches long: they feed on grasshoppers and the Seed of the wild plant which is also peculiar to this river and the upper parts of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missoury</name> somewhat resembling the whins—.<ref target="n23101708" n="8"/>

I took two men in a Small Canoe and assended the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name> 10 miles to an Island near the Stard. Shore on which two large Mat Lodges of Indians were drying Salmon, (as they informed me by Signs for the purpose of food and fuel, &amp; I do not think at all improbable that those people make use of Dried fish as fuel,[)] The number of dead Salmon on the Shores &amp; floating in the river is incrediable to Say and at this Season they have only to collect the fish Split them open and dry them on their Scaffolds on which they have great numbers, how far they have to raft their timber they make their Scaffolds of I could not lern; but there is no timber of any Sort except Small willow bushes in Sight in any direction— from this Island the natives showed me the enterance of a large Westerly fork which they Call <name type="place" key="Yakima (Tapteete) River">Tâpetêtt</name> at about 8 miles distant, the evening being late I deturmined to return to the forks, at which place I reached at Dark.    from the point up the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name> is N. 83° W. 6 miles to the lower point of an Island near the Lard. Side    passed a Island in the middle of the river at 5 miles at the head of which is a rapid, not dangerous    on the Lard Side opposite to this rapid is a fishing place 3 Mat Lodges, and great quants. of Salmon on Scaffolds drying. Saw great numbers of Dead Salmon on the Shores and floating in the water, great numbers of Indians on the banks viewing me and 18 canoes accompanied me from the point—    The Waters of this river is Clear, and a Salmon may be Seen at the deabth of 15 or 20 feet. West 4 miles to the lower point of a large island near the Stard. Side at 2 Lodges, passed three large lodges<ref target="n23101710" n="10"/> on the Stard Side near which great number of Salmon was drying on Scaffolds    one of those Mat lodges I entered found it crouded with men women and children and near the enterance of those houses I saw maney Squars engaged Splitting and drying Salmon. I was furnished with a mat to Sit on, and one man Set about prepareing me Something to eate, first he brought in a piece of a Drift log of pine and with a wedge of the elks horn, and a malet of Stone curioesly Carved he Split the log into Small pieces and lay'd it open on the fire on which he put round Stones, a woman handed him a basket of water and a large Salmon about half Dried, when the Stones were hot he put them into the basket of water with the fish which was Soon Suficently boiled for use.    it was then taken out put on a platter of rushes neetly made, and Set before me    they boiled a Salmon for each of the men with me, dureing those preperations, I Smoked with those about me who Chose to Smoke which was but fiew, this being a custom those people are but little accustomed to and only Smok thro form.    after eateing the boiled fish which was delicious, I Set out &amp; halted or came too on the Island at the two Lodges. Several fish was given to me, in return for Which I gave Small pieces of ribbond from those Lodges the natives Showed me the mouth of <hi rend="italic">Tap teel</hi> River about 8 miles above on the west Side    this western fork appears to beare nearly West, The main <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name> N W.—    a range of high land to the S W and parralal to the river and at the distance of 2 miles on the Lard.

Those women are more inclined to Copulency than any we have yet Seen, with low Stature broad faces, heads flatened 〈the eyes back〉 and the forward compressed so as to form a Streight line from the nose to the Crown of the head,<ref target="n23101712" n="12"/> their eyes are of a Duskey black, their hair of a corse black without orniments of any kind braded as above.</p>
               <p>
The orniments of each Sect are Similar, Such as large blue &amp; white beeds, either pendant from their ears or encircling their necks, or wrists &amp; arms.    They also ware bracelets Of Brass, Copper &amp; horn, and trinkets of Shells, fish bones and curious feathers. Their 〈Dress are as follows viz〉 garments Conists of a short Shirt of leather and a roabe of the Skins of Deer or the Antilope but fiew of them ware Shirts all have Short robes. Those people appears to live in a State of comparitive happiness: they take a greater Share labor of the woman, than in common among Savage tribes, and as I am informd. Content with one wife (as also those on the <name type="place"
                        key="Snake (Ki-moo-e-nim, Lewis's, Southeast Branch of Columbia) River">Ki moo e nim river</name>)    Those people respect the aged with veneration, I observed an old woman in one of the Lodges which I entered    She was entirely blind as I was informed by Signs, had lived more than 100 winters, She occupied the best position in the house, and when She Spoke great attention was paid to what She Said—.

                  <ref target="n23101713" n="13"/> rivers are Subject to Sore eyes, and maney are blind of one and Some of both eyes.    this misfortune must be owing to the reflections of the Sun &amp;c. on the waters in which they are continually fishing during the Spring Summer &amp; fall, &amp; the Snows dureing the, winter Seasons, in this open countrey where the eye has no rest.<ref target="n23101714" n="14"/> I have observed amongst those, as well in all other tribes which I have passed on these waters who live on fish maney of different Sectes who have lost their teeth 〈quit〉 about middle age, Some have their teeth worn to the gums, perticelar hose of the upper jaws, and the tribes generally have bad teeth    the cause of it I cannot account    sand attachd. to the roots &amp;c the method they have of useing the dri'd Salmon, which is mearly worming it and eating the rine &amp; Scales with the flesh of the fish, no doubt contributes to it<ref target="n23101715" n="15"/>

               <p>
The House or Lodges of the tribes of the main <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name> is of large mats made of rushes, Those houses are from 15 to 60 feet in length generally of an Oblong Squar form, Suported by poles on forks in the iner Side, Six feet high, the top is covered also with mats leaveing a Seperation in the whole length of about 12 or 15 inches wide, left for the purpose of admitting light and for the Smok of the fire to pass which is made in the middle of the house.— The roughfs are nearly flat, which proves to me that rains are not common in this open Countrey</p>
               <p>
Those people appeare of a mild disposition and friendly disposed— They have in their huts independant of their nets gigs &amp; fishing tackling each bows &amp; large quivers of arrows on which they use flint Spikes. Theire ammusements are Similar to those of the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>.    they are not beggerley and receive what is given them with much joy.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thursday 17th.</hi>    We remained here all day for the purpose of taking an observation. We got a number of dogs from the natives. Salmon are very plenty but poor and dying, and therefore not fit for provisions. In the plains 
are a great many hares and a number of fowls, between the size of a pheasant and turkey, called heath hens or grous. We killed a great many of these fowls which are very good eating. The small river, which we called <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flathead</name> and afterwards <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke's</name> river, is a branch of the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Great Columbia</name>, and running a northwest course, falls into it a considerable distance above this place; we 
therefore never passed the mouth of that river.<ref target="n23101719" n="19"/>

               <p>
Thursday October 17th    We had a clear pleasant morning.    Our officers delayed this day here, in order to ascertain the latitude of this place &amp;ca.    The Natives sold us several more dogs &amp;ca    They had very few buffalo robes among them, &amp; were cloathed in deer &amp; Elk skins dressed with the hair on &amp; sewed together, &amp; made into Robes.    Some of these Indians had Red &amp; blue Cloth &amp; a number of articles that must have been procured from some Civilized 〈people〉 nation.    They also had some horses.    They made signs to us that there is deer &amp; Elk below this place.—    We saw an immense quantity of Fowls in the plains, they were considerable larger than the Priari or heath hen.    Some of our party went out with Guns &amp; killed 3 of them.—    Our officers were of the opinion that the River which we descended, &amp; which we all took, to be the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name> should lose its name at this place and that the North fork being the largest should be called the <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>,<ref target="n23101721" n="21"/> &amp; the South fork of the River (or rather River) which we had descended, should be named <name type="place"

Salmon, Dogs &amp; a few Elk skins.    We saw a number of horses on the opposite shore, and a number of their Grave Yards, which were picketed in.    Our Officers took a Meridinal Oservation, &amp; found the Forks of these Two Rivers 
at their Confluence to lay in Latitude 46° 15' 13 7/10S North.
