               <p>A shower of rain fell very early this morning after which we dispatched the men for
          the remaining baggage at the 6 mile stake. 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>seting their tarkiln,
          Sergts. 
          <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>at work on the waystrips and myself
          and all other hands engaged in puting the boat together which we accomplished in about 3
          hours and I then set four men at work sewing the leather over the cross bars of Iron on
          the inner side of the boat, which form the ends of the sections.    about 2 P.
          M. the party returned with the baggage, all well pleased that they had completed the
          laborious task of the portage. The Musquetoes uncommonly troublesome    the
          wind hard from the S. W. all day    I think it possible that these almost
          perpetual S. W. winds proceede from the agency of the 
          <name type="place" key="Lewis (Snowy) Range">Snowey Mountains</name>and the wide level
          and untimbered plains which streach themselves along their bases for an immence distance
          (i e) that the air comeing in contact with the snow is suddonly chilled and condenced,
          thus becoming heaver than the air beneath in the plains, it glides down the sides of
          these mountains &amp; decends to the plains, where by the constant action of the sun on
          the face of an untimbered country there is a partial vacuum formed for it's reception. I
          have observed that the winds from this quarter are always the coldest and most violent
          which we experience, yet I am far from giving full credit to my own hypothesis on this
          subject; 
          <ref target="n16070201" n="1">if hoever I find on the opposite side of these mountains
          that the winds take a contrary direction I shall then have more faith.</ref>After I had
          completed my observation of Equal Altitudes today 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>Myself and 12 men passed over
          to the large Island to hunt bear.    the brush in that part of it where the
          bear frequent is an almost impenitrable thicket of the broad leafed willow; this brush
          we entered in small parties of 3 or four together and surched in every part.
             we found one only which made at 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and he shot him in the brest
          at the distance of about 20 feet, the ball fortunately passed through his heart, the
          stroke knocked the bear down and gave 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>time to get out of his sight;
          the bear changed his course we pursued him about a hundred yards by the blood and found
          him dead; we surched the thicket in every part but found no other, and therefore
          returned.    this was a young male and would weigh about 400 lbs.   
          the water of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>here is in most places about 10
          feet deep.    after our return, in moving some of the baggage we caught a
          large rat.
          <ref target="n16070202" n="2"/>   [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: Copy for 
          <name type="person" key="Barton, Benjamin Smith">Dr Barton</name>
                  </hi>]    it
          was somewhat larger than the common European rat, of lighter colour; the body and outer
          part of the legs and head of a light lead colour, the belly and inner side of the legs
          white as were also the feet and years.    the toes were longer and the ears
          much larger than the common rat; the ears uncovered with hair.    the eyes
          were black and prominent the whiskers very long and full.    the tail was
          reather longer than the body and covered with fine fur or poil of the same length and
          colour of the back.    the fur was very silkey close and short. I have
          frequently seen the nests of these rats in clifts of rocks and hollow trees but never
          before saw one of them.    they feed very much on the fruit and seed of the
          prickly pear; or at least I have seen large quantities of the hulls of that fruit lying
          about their holes and in their nests.</p>
