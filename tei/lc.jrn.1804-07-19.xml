          <ref target="n04071901" n="1"/>   July 19th    afte[r] breakfast
          which was on a rosted Ribs of a Deer a little and a little Coffee I walked on Shore
          intending only to Keep up with the Boat, Soon after I got on Shore, Saw Some fresh elk
          Sign, which I was induced to prosue those animals by their track to the hills
             after assending and passing thro a narrow Strip of wood Land, Came Suddenly
          into an open and bound less Prarie, I Say bound less because I could not See the extent
          of the plain in any Derection, the timber appeared to be confined to the River Creeks
          &amp; Small branches, this Prarie was Covered with grass about 18 Inches or 2 feat high
          and contained little of any thing else, except as before mentioned on the River Creeks
          &amp;c, This prospect was So Sudden &amp; entertaining that I forgot the object of my
          prosute and turned my attention to the Variety which presented themselves to my view
             after continueing on the rise for Some minits, I deturmined to make my
          course to a line of woods to S: E.    I found in this wood a butifull Streem
          of running water, in prosuing it down Several others Joined it and at 3 miles fell into
          the river between 2 clifts,
          <ref target="n04071902" n="2"/>I went up &amp; under one clift of dark rich Clay for ½
          me.    above this a Clay bank which had sliped in    her[e] I found
          Sand Stone Containing Iron ore, this ore appears to be inbeded under the Clay just above
          the water
