               <p>The morning was cloudy and continued to rain as usual, tho' the cloud seemed somewhat
          thiner. I therefore posponed seting out untill 9 A. M. in the hope that it would clear
          off but finding the contrary result I had the horses caught and we set out biding a
          lasting adieu to this place which I now call camp disappointment. I took my rout through
          the open plains S. E. 5 ms. passing a small creek
          <ref target="n37072601" n="1"/>at 2 ms. from the mountains wher I changed my direction
          to S. 75 E. for 7 ms. further and struck a 
          <name type="place"
                        key="Two Medicine River (Main or South Branch Marias River)">
          principal branch
          <ref target="n37072602" n="2"/>of Maria's river</name>65 yds. wide, not very deep, I
          passed this stream to it's south side and continued down it 2 ms. on the last mentioned
          course when another branch
          <ref target="n37072603" n="3"/>of nearly the same dignity formed a junction with it,
          coming from the S. W.    this last is shallow and rappid; has the appearance
          of overflowing it's banks frequently and discharging vast torrants of water at certain
          seasons of the year.    the beds of both these streams are pebbly particularly
          the S. branch.    the water of the N. branch is very terbid while that of the
          S. branch is nearly clear not withstanding the late rains. I passed the S. branch just
          above it's junction and continued down the river which runs a little to the N of E 1 ms.
          and halted to dine and graize our horses.
          <ref target="n37072604" n="4"/>   here I found some indian lodges which
          appeared to have been inhabited last winter in a large and fertile bottom well stocked
          with cottonwood timber.    the rose honeysuckle and redberry bushes constitute
          the undergrowth there being but little willow in this quarter both these rivers abov
          their junction appeared to be well stocked with timber or comparitively so with other
          parts of this country.    here it is that we find the three species of
          cottonwood which I have remarked in my voyage assembled together    that
          speceis common to the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>I have never before seen on the
          waters of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, also the narrow and broad
          leafed speceis.
          <ref target="n37072605" n="5"/>   during our stay at this place 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>killed a buck a part of the
          flesh of which we took with us.    we saw a few Antelopes some wolves and 2 of
          the smallest speceis of fox
          <ref target="n37072606" n="6"/>of a redish brown colour with the extremity of the tail
          black.    it is about the size of the common domestic cat and burrows in the
          plains.    after dinner I continued my rout down the river to the North of Eat
          about 3 ms. when the hills putting in close on the S side I determined to ascend them to
          the high plain which I did accordingly, keeping 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">the Fields</name>with me; 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>passed the river and kept
          down the vally of the river. I had intended to decend this river with it's course to
          it's junction with the fork which I had ascended and from thence have taken across the
          country obliquely to 
          <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">rose river</name>and decend that
          stream to it's confluence with 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>.
          <ref target="n37072607" n="7"/>the country through which this portion of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>passes to the fork which I
          ascended appears much more broken than that above and between this and the mountains. I
          had scarcely ascended the hills before I discovered to my left at the distance of a mile
          an assembleage of about 30 horses, I halted and used my spye glass by the help of which
          I discovered several indians on the top of an eminence just above them who appeared to
          be looking down towards the river I presumed at 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>. about half the horses were
          saddled.    this was a very unpleasant sight, however I resolved to make the
          best of our situation and to approach them in a friendly manner. I directed 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>to display the flag which I had
          brought for that purpose and advanced slowly toward them, about this time they
          discovered us and appeared to run about in a very confused manner as if much allarmed,
          their attention had been previously so fixed on 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>that they did not discover us
          untill we had began to advance upon them, some of them decended the hill on which they
          were and drove their horses within shot of it's summit and again returned to the hight
          as if to wate our arrival or to defend themselves. I calculated on their number being
          nearly or quite equal to that of their horses, that our runing would invite pursuit as
          it would convince them that we were their enimies and our horses were so indifferent
          that we could not hope to make our escape by flight; added to this 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>was seperated from us and I
          feared that his not being apprized of the indians in the event of our attempting to
          escape he would most probably fall a sacrefice.    under these considerations
          I still advanced towards them; when we had arrived 〈at the distance of〉 within a quarter
          of a mile of them, one of them mounted his horse and rode full speed towards us, which
          when I discovered I halted and alighted from my horse; he came within a hundred paces
          halted looked at us and turned his horse about and returned as briskly to his party as
          he had advanced; while he halted near us I held out my hand and becconed to him to
          approach but he paid no attention to my overtures.    on his return to his
          party they all decended the hill and mounted their horses and advanced towards us
          leaving their horses behind them, we also advanced to meet them. I counted eight of them
          but still supposed that there were others concealed as there were several other horses
          saddled. I told the two men with me that I apprehended that these were the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians, Piegan">Minnetares of Fort de
          Prarie</name>and from their known character I expected that we were to have some
          difficulty with them; that if they thought themselves sufficiently strong I was
          convinced they would attempt to rob us in which case be their numbers what they would I
          should resist to the last extremity prefering death to that of being deprived of my
          papers instruments and gun and desired that they would form the same resolution and be
          allert and on their guard.    when we arrived within a hundred yards of each
          other the indians except one halted I directed the two men with me to do the same and
          advanced singly to meet the indian with whom I shook hands and passed on to those in his
          rear, as he did also to the two men in my rear; we now all assembled and alighted from
          our horses; the Indians soon asked to smoke with us, but I told them that the man whom
          they had seen pass down the river had my pipe and we could not smoke untill he joined
          us. I requested as they had seen which way he went that they would one of them go with
          one of my men in surch of him, this they readily concented to and a young man set out
          with 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>in surch of 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>. I now asked them by sighns
          if they were the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians, Piegan">Minnetares of the
          North</name>which they answered in the affermative;
          <ref target="n37072608" n="8"/>I asked if there was any cheif among them and they
          pointed out 3    I did not believe them however I thought it best to please
          them and gave to one a medal to a second a flag and to the third a handkercheif, with
          which they appeared well satisfyed.    they appeared much agitated with our
          first interview from which they had scarcely yet recovered, in fact I believe they were
          more allarmed at this accedental interview than we were.    from no more of
          them appearing I now concluded they were only eight in number and became much better
          satisfyed with our situation as I was convinced that we could mannage that number should
          they attempt any hostile measures.    as it was growing late in the evening I
          proposed that we should remove to the nearest part of the river and encamp together, I
          told them that I was glad to see them and had a great deel to say to them.   
          we mounted our horses and rode towards the river which was at but a short distance, on
          our way we were joined by 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>
                  <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Fields</name>and the indian.    we
          decended a very steep bluff about 250 feet high to the river where there was a small
          bottom of nearly ½ a mile in length and about 250 yards wide in the widest part,
          <ref target="n37072609" n="9"/>the river washed the bluffs both above and below us and
          through it's course in this part is very deep; the bluffs are so steep that there are
          but few places where they could be ascended, and are broken in several places by deep
          nitches which extend back from the river several hundred yards, their bluffs being so
          steep that it is impossible to ascend them; in this bottom there stand tree solitary
          trees
          <ref target="n37072610" n="10"/>near one of which the indians formed a large
          simicircular camp
          <ref target="n37072611" n="11"/>of dressed buffaloe skins and invited us to partake of
          their shelter which 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and myself accepted and the 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fieldses</name>lay near the fire in
          front of the sheter.    with the assistance of 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>I had much conversation with
          these people in the course of the evening. I learned from them that they were a part of
          a large band which lay encamped at present near the foot of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>on the 
          <name type="place"
                        key="Two Medicine River (Main or South Branch Marias River)">main
          branch of Maria's river</name>one ½ days march from our present encampment; that there
          was a whiteman with their band; that there was another large band of their nation
          hunting buffaloe near the broken mountains and were on there way to the mouth of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>where they would probably be
          in the course of a few days.    they also informed us that from hence to the
          establishment where they trade on the 
          <name type="place" key="Saskatchewan River">Suskasawan river</name>is only 6 days easy
          march or such as they usually travel with their women and childred which may be
          estimated at about 150 ms.
          <ref target="n37072612" n="12"/>that from these traders they obtain arm amunition
          sperituous liquor blankets &amp;c in exchange for wolves and some beaver skins. I told
          these people that I had come a great way from the East up the large river which runs
          towards the rising sun, that I had been to the great waters where the sun sets and had
          seen a great many nations all of whom I had invited to come and trade with me on the
          rivers on this side of the mountains, that I had found most of them at war with their
          neighbours and had succeeded in restoring peace among them, that I was now on my way
          home and had left my party at the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">falls of the
          misouri</name>with orders to decend that river to the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>and there wait my arrival and
          that I had come in surch of them in order to prevail on them to be at peace with their
          neighbours particularly those on the West side of the mountains and to engage them to
          come and trade with me when the establishment is made at the entrance of this river to
          all which they readily gave their assent and declared it to be their wish to be at peace
          with the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Tushepahs</name>whom they said had
          killed a number of their relations lately and pointed to several of those present who
          had cut their hair as an evidince of the truth of what they had asserted. I found them
          extreemly fond of smoking and plyed them with the pipe untill late at night.
             I told them that if they intended to do as I wished them they would send
          some of their young men to their band with an invitation to their chiefs and warriors to
          bring the whiteman with them and come down and council with me at the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>and that the ballance of them
          would accompany me to that place, where I was anxious now to meet my men as I had been
          absent from them some time and knew that they would be uneasy untill they saw me.
             that if they would go with me I would give them 10 horses and some tobacco.
             to this proposition they made no reply, I took the first watch tonight and
          set up untill half after eleven; the indians by this time were all asleep, I roused up 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>and laid down myself; I directed
          
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Fields</name>to watch the movements of the
          indians and if any of them left the camp to awake us all as I apprehended they would
          attampt to seal [steal] our horses.    this being done I fell into a profound
          sleep and did not wake untill the noise of the men and indians awoke me a little after
          light in the morning.—</p>
