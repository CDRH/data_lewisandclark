          pleasant, and a fair wind from S. E. At 8 we halted for breakfast, when our young Indian
          left us to go to his camp at a handsome prairie, gently rising from the river on the
          north side; a small distance above which are beautiful groves of Cotton wood on both
          sides of the river. About 12 one of the periogues run against a snag which broke a hole
          in it. We then crossed to the south side to mend the periogue, and to wait to receive
          the Indians we expected; and landed a little below some high bluffs. Our camp was in a
          wide bottom, in which are large elm
