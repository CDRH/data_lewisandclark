                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Cap Clark</name>set out this morning to go a
          head with six hunters.
          <ref target="n22091802" n="2"/>   there being no game in these mountains we
          concluded it would be better for one of us to take the hunters and hurry on to the
          leavel country a head and there hunt and provide some provision 〈for〉 while the other
          remained with and brought on the party    the latter of these was my part;
          accordingly I directed the horses to be gotten up early being determined to force my
          march as much as the abilities of our horses would permit. the negligence of one of the
          party 
          <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>who had a spare horse 〈in〉
          not attending to him and bringing him up last evening was the cause of our detention
          this morning untill ½ after 8 A M when we set out. I sent 
          <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>back to serch for his horse,
          and proceeded on with the party    at four in the evening he overtook us
          without the horse, we marched 18 miles this day and encamped on the side of a steep
          mountain;
          <ref target="n22091803" n="3"/>we suffered for water this day passing one rivulet only;
          we wer fortunate in finding water in a steep raviene about ½ maile from our camp.
             this morning we finished the remainder of our last coult.    we
          dined &amp; suped on a skant proportion of portable soupe,
          <ref target="n22091804" n="4"/>a few canesters of which, a little bears oil and about
          20 lbs. of candles form our stock of provision, the only resources being our guns &amp;
          packhorses.    the first is but a poor dependance in our present situation
          where there is nothing upon earth exept ourselves and a few small pheasants, small grey
          Squirrels, and a blue bird of the vulter kind about the size of a turtle dove or jay
          bird.
          <ref target="n22091805" n="5"/>   our rout lay along the ridge of a high
          mountain course S. 20 W. 18 m.    used the snow for cooking.—</p>

          and made a little portable Soup.    the Mountains continue as fer as our eyes

          All our horses except one were collected early: Six hunters
          <ref target="n22091814" n="14"/>went on ahead; one man
          <ref target="n22091815" n="15"/>to look for the horse; and all the rest of us proceeded
          on our journey over the mountains, which are very high and rough. About 12 we passed a
          part where the snow was off, and no appearance that much had lately fallen. At 3 we came
          to snow again, and halted to take some soup, which we made with snow water, as no other
          could be found. Here the man, who had been sent for the horse came up, but had not found
          him. Except on the sides of hills where it has fallen, the country is closely timbered
          with pitch and spruce pine, and what some call balsam-fir.
          <ref target="n22091816" n="16"/>We can see no prospect of getting off these desert
          mountains yet, except the appearance of a deep cove on each side of the ridge we are
          passing along. We remained here an hour and an half, and then proceeded on down a steep
          mountain, and encamped after travelling 18 miles. We had great difficulty in getting
          water, being obliged to go half a mile for it down a very steep precipice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wednesday 18th Sept. 1805</hi>.    a clear pleasant morning
             
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>and Six hunters Set out at
          Sunrise to go on a head to try to kill Some game if possable.    we got up all
          our horses except one which we expect is lost.    one man Sent back Some
          distance to hunt him.    we Set out about 7 oClock and proceeded on a ridge of
          the mountains Some distance, then went up and down rough rockey mountains as usal.
             but verry little water.    about 3 oClock P. m. we halted on a
          ridge of the mountn. to let our horses feed a little, and melt a little Snow as we found
          no water to make a little Port. Soup as we have nothing else to eat.    the
          day moderate the Snow melts a little.    the mountains appear a head as fer as
          we can See.    they continue much further than we expected.    we
          proceeded on down a verry Steep part of the mount. then up on the side of another before
          we found any water, and Campd at dark on the Side of the motn. where we found a Spring
          by going down a Steep hill where it was dangerous to take our horses to water.
             we Suped on a little portable Soup and lay down on this Sideling mount.
             Came 14 miles day</p>
               <p>Wednesday Septemr 18th    This morning clear pleasant weather, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>&amp; Six of our best
          hunters, set out at sunrise to go on a head; to try &amp; kill some Game if possible, We
          got up all our horses excepting one, which we expect we have lost, One of the party was
          sent back to hunt him.    We then set out &amp; proceeded on our Journey,
          about 7 oClock A. M. we passed on a ridge of mountains, some distance, then ascended
          &amp; descended rough rockey Mountains as usual, &amp; found but very little Water.
             About 3 o'Clock P. M. we halted on a ridge of the Mountains to let our
          horses feed, and to melt some Snow to make a little portable Soup, having nothing else
          to eat.    The weather moderated, &amp; the snow melted a little.   
          The Mountains appear a head of us as far as we can see &amp; continue much further than
          we expected.—</p>
               <p>We proceeded on down a very steep part of the Mountain, then ascended the side of
          another mountain; where we found water.    We encamped on the side of this
          mountain at dark, &amp; found a spring, which was down a steep hill, which was so
          dangerous to descend, that we did not take our horses to it for water.    We
          supped on a little portable Soup, &amp; lay down on a Sideling mountain.    We
          came about 14 Miles this day.—</p>
