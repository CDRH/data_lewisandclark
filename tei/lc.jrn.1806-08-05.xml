          remain this morning for them.    the hunters killed four deer this morning
          near our encampment. I remained untill noon when I again reimbarked and set out
          concluding that as

          <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>had not arrived by that time that

          done last evening had not the centinel hailed him.    we continued our rout
          untill late in the evening when I came too and encamped on the South side about 10 miles

          <ref target="n37080501" n="1"/>   on our way we killed a fat cow and took as

          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Feildses</name>killed 2 large bear
          this evening one of them measured nine feet from the extremity of the nose to that of
          his tail, this is the largest bear except one that I have seen.    we saw
          several bear today as we passed but did not kill any of them.    we also saw
          on our way immence herds of buffaloe &amp; Elk, many deer Antelopes, wolves, geese
          Eagles &amp;c. but few ducks or prarie hens.
          <ref target="n37080502" n="2"/>   the geese cannot fly at present; I saw a
          solitary Pillacon
          <ref target="n37080503" n="3"/>the other day in the same situation.    this
          happens from their sheding or casting the fathers of the wings at this season.</p>

               <p>The Musquetors was So troublesom to the men last night that they Slept but very
          little.    indeed they were excessive troublesom to me.    my
          Musquetor Bear has a number of Small holes worn through they pass in. I Set out at an
          early hour intending to proceed to Some other Situation. I had not proceded on far
          before I Saw a ram of the big horn Animal near the top of a Lard. Bluff    I
          assended the hill with a view to kill the ram.    the Misquetors was So
          noumerous that I could not keep them off my gun long enough to take Sight and by thair
          means missed.    at 10 a. m. the wind rose with a gentle breeze from the N. W.
          which in Some measure thinned the Misquetors. I landed on a Sand bar from the South
          Point intending to form a Camp at this place and Continue untill 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt Lewis</name>Should arive.   
          and killed two Buck Elks and a Deer the best of their flesh &amp; fat I had Saved.
             had all the dryed meat &amp; fat put out to Sun and continued at this place
          untill late in the evening finding that there were no buffalow or fresh Sign I
          deturmined to proceed on accordingly Set out at 4 P. M and proceeded on but a fiew miles
          eeir I saw a Bear of the white Species walking on a Sand bear. I with one man went on
          the Sand bear and killed the Bear which proved to be a feemale very large and fat. much
          the fattest animale we have killed on the rout as this bear has got into the river
          before we killed her I had her toed across to the South Side under a high Bluff where
          formed a Camp,
          <ref target="n37080504" n="4"/>had the bear Skined and fleaced.    our
          Situation was exposed to a light breeze of wind which continued all the forepart of the
          night from the S W. and blew away the misquetors.</p>

             a little after dark came up a hard Thunder Shower of wind and rain and
          nearly filled our canoes, So that we had to unload them.    the Sand flew So

          heard at a distance. About midnight the small canoe
          <ref target="n37080505" n="5"/>we left yesterday came floating down with the current,
          and would have passed us if our centinel had not hailed it; the hunters in it killed a
          bear and two deer. This morning was also cloudy, and we halted here till noon in
          expectation that the other canoe
          <ref target="n37080506" n="6"/>would come down; but there was then no appearance of it;
          and we began to suspect it had passed in the night. The forenoon had become clear and
          pleasant, and at noon we got under way. As we went on we killed a very fat buffaloe and
          some deer; and two hunters
          <ref target="n37080507" n="7"/>who went on a-head in the morning, killed two very large
          brown bears. At sunset we encamped and at dark a violent gust of rain and wind came on
          with thunder and lightening, which lasted about an hour; after which we had a fine clear
          night.</p>
