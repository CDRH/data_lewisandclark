               <p>The two young Cheifs who visited last evening returned to their village on

          bullets.    they were also directed to procure some bags for the purpose of
          containing our roots &amp; bread.    in the evening they all returned except 
          <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>who remained all night.
             they procured a few strings but no bags.

          excurtion up 
          <name type="place" key="Lolo (Collins's) Creek (Idaho)">Collins's Creek</name>this
          evening.    we wish to leave the deer in the neighbourhood of the 
          <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">quawmash
          plains</name>undisturbed untill the 10th when we intend removing thither to lay in some
          meat for our voyage over the Mountains.    our party are much engaged in
          preparing their saddles arranging their loads provisions &amp;c for our departure. There
          is a speceis of cherry
          <ref target="n35060703" n="3"/>which grows in this neighbourhood in sitations like the
          Choke cherry or near the little rivulets and wartercouses.    it seldom grows
          in clumps or from the same cluster of roots as the choke cherry dose.    the
          stem is simple branching reather diffuse stem the cortex is of a redish dark brown and
          reather smooth.    the leaf is of the ordinary dexture and colour of those of
          most cherries, it is petiolate; a long oval 1¼ inhes in length and ½ an inch in width,
          obtuse, margin so finely serrate that it is scarcely perseptable &amp; smooth.
             the peduncle is common 1 inch in length, branch proceeding from the
          extremities as well as the sides of the branches, celindric gradually tapering; the
          secondary peduncles are about ½ an inch in length scattered tho' proceeding more from
          the extremity of the common peduncle and are each furnished with a small bracted.
             the parts of fructification are much like those discribed of the choke
          cherry except that the petals are reather longer as is the calix reather deeper.
             the cherry appears to be half grown, the stone is begining to be hard and
          is in shape somewhat like that of the plumb; it appears that when ripe it would be as
          large as the Kentish cherry, which indeed the growth of the bush somewhat resembles; it
          rises about 6 or 8 feet high</p>

          vast body of water; notwithstanding it's high State the water remains nearly
          transparent, and it's temperature appears to be quit as cold as that of our best
          Springs.    we met with a butifull little bird in this neighbourhood about the
          Size and Somewhat the Shape of the large Sparrow.    it measures 7 inches from
          the extremity of the beak to that of the tail, the latter Occupying 2½ inches.
             the beak is reather more than half an inch in length, and is formed much
          like the Virginia Nightingal; red bd. it is thick and large for a bird of it's size,
          wide at the base, both Chaps convex, and pointed, the upper exceeds the under chap a
          little is Somewhat cirved and of a brown Colour; the lower chap of a Greenish yellow.
             the eye full reather large and of a black colour both puple and iris.
             the plumage is remarkably delicate; that of the neck and head is of a fine
          orrange yellow and red.    the latter predomonates on the top of the head and
          around the base of the beak from whence it gradually diminishes towards the lower part
          of the Neck, the orring yellow prevails most, the red has the Appearance of haveing been
          laid over a Ground of yellow.    the breast, the Sides, rump and some long
          feathers which lie between the legs extend underneath the tail is of a fine orrange
          yellow.    the tail, back and wings are black, except a Small Strip of yellow
          on the outer part of the Middle joint of the wing, ¼ of an inch wide and an inch in
          length.    the tail is composed of 12 feathers of which those in the Center
          are reather Shortest, and the plumage of all the feathers of the tail is longest on that
          Side of the quill next to the Center of the tail.    the legs and feet are
          black, nails long and Sharp; it has four toes on each foot, of which three are forward
          and one behind; that behind is as long as the two outer of the three toes in front—.</p>

          drops of rain. I went over with five of our party
          <ref target="n35060707" n="7"/>to the village, on the other side of the river; and
          while we were going some snow fell. The greater part of the natives were out hunting. In
          the evening we all returned to camp, except two, who remained at the village. Some of
          the natives again came to visit us, one of whom
          <ref target="n35060708" n="8"/>gave a horse to one of our men,
          <ref target="n35060709" n="9"/>who is very fond of conversing with them and of learning
          their language.</p>
