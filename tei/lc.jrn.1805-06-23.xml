               <p>This morning early I scelected a place for the purpose of constructing my boat near
          the water under some shady willows. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>had the Canoe and baggage
          brought up, after which we breakfasted and nearly consumed the meat which he had left
          her[e].    he now set out on his return with the party. I employed the three
          men with me in the forenoon clearing away the brush and forming our camp, and puting the
          frame of the boat together.    this being done I sent 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Shields</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>to look out for the necessary timber,
          and with 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>decended the river in the canoe
          to the mouth of 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medicine
          river</name>in surch of the hunters whom I had dispatched thither on the 19th inst. and
          from whom we had not heard a sentence. I entered the mouth of 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">medicine
          river</name>and ascended it about half a mile when we landed and walked up the Stard.
          side. frequently hooping as we went on in order to find the hunters; at length after
          ascending the river about five miles we found 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>who had passed the 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medecine
          river</name>&amp; fixed his camp on the Lard. side, where he had killed seven deer and
          several buffaloe and dryed about 600 lbs. of buffaloe meat; but had killed no Elk. 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>could give me no further account
          of 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Fields</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>than that he had left them
          about noon on the 19th at the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">great falls</name>and had
          come on the mouth of 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medicine
          river</name>to hunt Elk as he had been directed, and never had seen them since.
             the evening being now far spent I thought it better to pass the 
          <name type="place" key="Sun (Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, Medicine) River">Medicine
          river</name>and remain all night at 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon's</name>camp; I passed the river on a
          raft which we soon constructed for the purpose.    the river is here about 80
          yds. wide, is deep and but a moderate current.    the banks low as those of
          the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>above 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>yet never
          appear to overflow.    as it will give a better view of the transactions of
          the party, I shall on each day give the occurrences of both camps during our seperation
          as I afterwards learnt those of 
          <name type="place" key="Lower portage camp">the lower camp</name>from 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>.    on his return
          today he cut of several angles of the rout by which we came yesterday, shortened the
          portage considerably, measured it and set up stakes throughout as guides to marke the
          rout.    he returned this evening to 
          <name type="place" key="Lower portage camp">the lower camp</name>in sufficient time to
          take up two of the canoes from portage creek to the top of the plain about a mile in
          advance.    this evening the men repaired their mockersons, and put on double
          souls to protect their feet from the prickley pears.    during the late rains
          the buffaloe have troden up the praire very much, which having now become dry the sharp
          points of earth as hard as frozen ground stand up in such abundance that there is no
          avoiding them.    this is particulary severe on the feet of the men who have
          not only their own wight to bear in treading on those hacklelike points but have also
          the addition of the burthen which they draw and which in fact is as much as they can
          possibly move with.    they are obliged to halt and rest frequently for a few
          minutes, at every halt these poor fellows tumble down and are so much fortiegued that
          many of them are asleep in an instant; in short their fatiegues are incredible; some are
          limping from the soreness of their feet, others faint and unable to stand for a few
          minutes, with heat and fatiegue, yet no one complains, all go with cheerfullness.
             in evening 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name>returned to 
          <name type="place" key="Lower portage camp">the lower camp</name>and informed 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>of the absence of 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, with rispect to whome they
          were extreemly uneasy. 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Fields</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>had killed several buffaloe
          at the bend of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name>above 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>and had
          dryed a considerable quantity of meat; they had also killed several deer but no
          Elk.—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sunday 23rd.</hi>   The morning was cloudy. When I awoke
          this morning I found a material difference between the river and country here and below 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>. Here the
          river is wide and the current gentle. There are three small islands at this place and
          some timber on the banks, but not much, and what is there is cotton-wood and willow. The
          banks are very low, and the country rising in plains a considerable distance on both
          sides of the river; and far off mountains covered with snow on both sides and ahead. Two
          of the men
          <ref target="n16062304" n="4"/>and myself remained with 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>here to assist him in
          putting together his iron boat, the rest went back for another load. The iron boat-frame
          is to be covered with skins and requires a quantity of thin shaved strips of wood for
          lining. In the forenoon we put the frame together, which is 36 feet long, 4½ wide, and 2
          feet 2 inches deep. In the afternoon
