               <hi rend="italic">This study examines how the nation's print media played a role in the
          making of heroes out of early American explorers. The method includes examining the
          magazine and newspaper text for hero labels and those important hero referents that
          scholars have long described: distinctive physical skills, an exemplary response to a
          challenge, and admirable moral characteristics, as well as a reputation that transcends
          a lifetime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Americans celebrated the news that the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition had unexpectedly
        reappeared near 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>on 23 September 1806. Convinced
        that the men had all perished,
        <ref target="n01" n="1"/>the country, along with 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</name>, expressed
        "unspeakable joy"; 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>wrote 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Meriwether Lewis</name>, "The length
        of time without hearing of you had begun to be felt awfully."
        <ref target="n02" n="2"/>The 1806–1807 return of the Corps of Discovery
        <ref target="n03" n="3"/>is the focus of this article.</p>
            <p>The aim here is to add to the theoretical conceptualization of heroism in an era known
        for espousing egalitarianism and when contemporary news stories about heroes were rare.
        Repeated patterns of coverage, such as recurrent phrases, can symbolically structure the
        social world in a meaningful way.
        <ref target="n04" n="4"/>Thus, this study examines news coverage as a way of
        understanding an aspect of the social world of 1806–1807. During this early national
        period,
        <ref target="n05" n="5"/>when the press was vigorously partisan and primarily carried
        spot news reports, news attributes consistently used in stories about the Corps will
        suggest not only the social significance of the explorers' feats, but also the specific
        types of heroes the men were upon their return.</p>
            <p>In 1800, the press was small and elite. The nation's twenty-four daily and 234 weekly
        newspapers had low circulations, in part because access was limited by prohibitive
        subscription costs (up to $10 yearly, while the annual salary was less then $60).
        <ref target="n06" n="6"/>Aimed at voting citizens, the news reports were mainly of
        political happenings, mostly from the nation's capital. Whether supported by the
        Federalist or Democratic-Republican political parties, newspapers rarely ran what today
        would be called feature stories.
        <ref target="n07" n="7"/>Rather, it was the magazines that emphasized people, usually
        earlier notables—without labeling them heroes—such as patriots from the Revolutionary War
        and leaders and political men of the Enlightenment. Magazines such as 
        <hi rend="italic">The Monthly Anthology</hi>were "to celebrate useful talents, to record
        patriotick [
        <hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] labours, and to exhibit characteristic traits of virtue."
        <ref target="n08" n="8"/>
            </p>
            <p>Today, a "hero" label can be overused and overlaps with a "celebrity" status, writes
        historian Daniel Boorstin.
        <ref target="n09" n="9"/>In 1806 the term "hero" rarely appeared in print text to
        describe contemporary individuals in a society that ideally valued "every man," every
        citizen equally. Yet, texts alone do not determine social meaning; rather meanings emerge
        in interaction with audience perceptions, values, and memory at the time, write Pan and
        Kosicki.
        <ref target="n10" n="10"/>During the early nineteenth century, writers who referred to
        heroes generally wrote of a much earlier time. The oral tradition of the Old World told,
        through songs and poetry, about brave and noble deeds. Certainly, many Americans knew from
        their European roots about such heroes, dating to Homer's epic poetry.
        <ref target="n11" n="11"/>Yet, when the neonate U.S. magazines wrote about American
        patriots, gentlemen, and scholars, the emphasis was on their "duty and obligation."
        <ref target="n12" n="12"/>It would take another generation for the press to call the
        founding fathers heroes.
        <ref target="n13" n="13"/>Communication researchers note that for media recognition, the
        hero must exhibit a greatness of soul in the connection with a particular pursuit, most
        often remembered only after the person's death.
        <ref target="n14" n="14"/>
            </p>
            <p>Many scholars point out that heroes long were god-like creatures, mostly male,
        <ref target="n15" n="15"/>with superhuman abilities or strength. In fact, no matter the
        era or continent, heroes exhibit similar attributes: distinctive physical skills, an
        exemplary response to a set of challenges or a particular challenge, and admirable moral
        characteristics. Moreover, the person's reputation must transcend a lifetime.
        <ref target="n16" n="16"/>Thus, this study examines the print media coverage for
        descriptions of the Corps members and in particular seeks the references to these
        generally agreed-upon heroic attributes.

        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>. At 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>(now in 
        <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>), the expedition picked up fur

        <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Pomp</name>).</p>
            <p>Traveling 7,000 miles, the expedition left 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">Woods River</name>, which is across the 
        <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</name>from 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>; it went up the

        now in 
        <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>, across the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>; and then followed the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>, and back. Although Congress
        initially appropriated $2,500 for this controversial and partisan exploration,
        <ref target="n18" n="18">"</ref>the expedition eventually cost almost twenty times that
        amount.
        <ref target="n19" n="19"/>
            </p>
            <p>Readers of the earliest news reports knew that the Corps was preparing their departure
        from the 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>area in 1804 and that they left 14
        May. While the newspapers focused on 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, one account, later
        copied by other newspapers, referred to other members, albeit unnamed. For example, a June
        
        <hi rend="italic">National Intelligencer</hi>reported that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>had "engaged three hunters
        whose knowledge of the different tribes of Indians extended a considerable distance."
        According to the 
        <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer</hi>, hunters said that during their excursions they saw
        "an Indian woman who had been taken prisoner from a nation who lives on the shores of the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>."
        <ref target="n20" n="20"/>This 
        <hi rend="italic">might</hi>be a reference to 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, although this mention is as vague as
        her identification.</p>
            <p>Months later, newspapers and magazines printed the explorers' letters from 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, although the emphasis
        remained on the two captains. In July 1805, The 
        <hi rend="italic">Evening Fireside</hi>summarized the correspondence from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, including 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s report to the President. This
        printed account used value-laden language for the Corps: these were "enterprising young
        men" who applied their physical skills in the midst of potential danger. "Our travelers
        experienced a severe winter.... The party was in good health...only one man died on the
        journey."
        <ref target="n21" n="21"/>Here, the account identified a Corps member other than the
        captains. The 
        <hi rend="italic">Boston Centinel</hi>reported that the captains had named a river, 
        <name type="place" key="Floyd River">Floyd's River</name>, to honor 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd</name>, "who died much regretted on
        the 20th of August."</p>
            <p>The 
        <hi rend="italic">Centinel</hi>also emphasized the captains' admirable moral
        characteristics: "the men speak in the highest terms of the humanity, and the uncommon
        pains and attention of both captains, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark">Clark</name>,toward the whole of them...."
        <ref target="n22" n="22"/>

         <div type="article">
            <head>The End of the Journey</head>
            <p>But the beginning of designating the captains as heroes meant celebrating the return of
        the journey that happened with festivities in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>and elsewhere. The original group
        who left 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in 1805 reappeared in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>intact as a unit on 23 September
        1806, with the exception of 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name>, who had returned to the

        remained in 
        <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>.</p>
            <p>Because no newspapers were published in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, the nearest publications, in 
        <name type="place" key="Frankfurt, Kent.">Frankfort</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Kentucky">Kentucky</name>, broke the story of the explorers'
        reappearance and the joyful reception with anonymous letters sent east. After the 
        <hi rend="italic">Frankfort Palladium</hi>and the 
        <hi rend="italic">Frankfort Gazette</hi>published the letters, other newspapers reprinted
        the same accounts, often verbatim. For example, one unnamed 
        <name type="place" key="St. Charles, Mo.">St. Charles</name>letter writer emphasized the
        Corps' feat: "They were the first white people that ever visited that country."
        <ref target="n23" n="23"/>The 
        <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Register</hi>introduced one article as "A letter taken from
        a 
        <name type="place" key="Kentucky">Kentucky</name>paper." The anonymous account pointed out
        the explorers' particular challenges: "They had to pack one hundred and sixty miles from
        the head of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>to the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia river</name>."
        <ref target="n24" n="24"/>

        <hi rend="italic">Frederickstown</hi>(
        <name type="place" key="Maryland">Maryland</name>) 
        <hi rend="italic">Herald's</hi>introduction to this letter indicated the excitement over
        the men's reappearance, referring by name only to the Captains: "We stop the press to
        announce with the sincere pleasure, the following 
        <hi rend="italic">Highly interesting intelligence</hi>, Captains 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>are just arrived, all in very good
        health." The editor emphasized the surprising return, given that no news had been heard
        for over a year. The 
        <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>account, also taken from the 
        <hi rend="italic">Frankfort Palladium</hi>, relied on 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s letter to the President and
        repeated 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s stance that 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s leader-ship, despite the unsettled
        question of his rank, deserved equal recognition: "
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>speaks of his colleague, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">captain Clarke</name>[

        <name type="place" key="Philadelphia, Penn.">Philadelphia</name>,
        <ref target="n26" n="26"/>described the response in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>to the Corps' dangerous task: "The
        great concourse of people that lined the bank of the river... must be considered as strong
        evidence of the respect entertained for those gentlemen for the danger and difficulties
        they must have encountered...."
        <ref target="n27" n="27"/>The 
        <hi rend="italic">National Intelligence</hi>, so closely aligned with the 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>administration
        <ref target="n28" n="28"/>as an anti–Federalist, Democrat–Republican newspaper, described
        the return as a "desirable and unexpected event."
        <ref target="n29" n="29"/>
            </p>
            <p>No matter how partisan, the Federalist newspapers could not ignore this news event. The
        
        <hi rend="italic">Baltimore Federal Gazette</hi>reported the public's cheers, and the
        shots were fired on behalf of the Corps, who "really have the appearance of Robinson
        Crusoe—dressed entirely in buckskins." The 
        <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>noted that the men were all "in good health with only the
        loss of one man who died." It described their challenge: "They would have been here about
        the 1st of August, but for the detention they met with from snow and frost in crossing
        mountains on which are eternal snows."

        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>requested. The newspaper
        explained that the challenge was too great and dangers such that 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>needed all the men and "says it
        was fortunate he sent no men back, since they owed their lives more than once to their
        numbers."

            </p>
            <p>Eastern newspapers published personal letters sent to family and friends to describe
        events. With this correspondence, the newspapers told of a festive 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>dinner and ball, held 25 September
        and attended by leading 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>residents.
        <ref target="n33" n="33"/>Emphasizing the Corps' feat and sacrifice, both the 
        <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>and the 
        <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer</hi>recounted the explorers' patriotic labors and the
        ensuing public esteem "for those characters who are willing to encounter, fatigue and
        hunger for the benefit of their fellow citizens." The news accounts repeated banquet
        toasts, which came the closest to the language of heroes. One compared the Corps, in
        particular 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, to 
        <name type="person" key="Columbus, Christopher">Christopher Columbus</name>, whose
        talents, skills, challenges, and honors transcended a lifetime. "The memory of 
        <name type="person" key="Columbus, Christopher">Christopher Columbus</name>—may those who
        imitate his hardship, perseverance and merit, never have, like him, to encounter publick
        ingratitude."
        <ref target="n34" n="34"/>And, after the captains retired, the toasts became effusive,
        according to the 
        <hi rend="italic">Western World</hi>: "To Captains 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>—their perilous services endear them
        to every American heart."
        <ref target="n35" n="35"/>
            </p>
            <p>Just as had 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s letters, the writers describing
        these festivities placed the two captains together as joint leaders of a joint effort, as
        well as authors of what became a joint account.
        <ref target="n36" n="36"/>In fact, the captains collaborated on a letter that become the
        first public version of what happened and that thereby framed their story for the press,
        emphasizing their successful transcontinental crossing, the challenges, the dangers, and
        their physical and mental skills. As they neared 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, the better writer, drafted a
        letter addressed to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s brother 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, George">George</name>in 
        <name type="place" key="Kentucky">Kentucky</name>, the site of the closest newspapers. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>then copied and mailed this letter as
        soon as they arrived in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>on 23 September.
        <ref target="n37" n="37"/>This version of the expedition was immediately published in the
        
        <hi rend="italic">Frankfort Palladium</hi>on 6 October 1806 and became the most repeated
        and longest story in every newspaper examined here.
        <ref target="n38" n="38"/>
            </p>
            <p>Much like a modern day press release, the captains' joint letter became 
        <hi rend="italic">the</hi>news article. Newspapers repeated not just the letter, but the
        same laudatory congratulations of the 
        <hi rend="italic">Frankfort Palladium</hi>"on the happy termination of an expedition,
        which will doubtless be productive of incalculable commercial advantages in the western
        country...."
        <ref target="n39" n="39"/>In other words, the Corps efforts would be financially
        beneficial to nation-building.</p>
            <p>These repeated news accounts also republished the 
        <hi rend="italic">Palladium</hi>'s introduction, emphasizing Corps attributes: "we are
        persuaded all think and feel alike, on the courage, perseverance and prudent deportment
        displayed by this adventurous party."
        <ref target="n40" n="40"/>Together these writings gave important heroic referents. 
        <hi rend="italic">The Literary Magazine and American Register</hi>, which copied the 
        <hi rend="italic">Palladium</hi>, will be used below to show 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s account, whose descriptions
        included various enduring aspects of a hero in ways consistent with scholarly literature.
        <ref target="n41" n="41"/>
            </p>
            <p>Scholars point out that heroes generally enact an 
        <hi rend="italic">exemplary response to a particular challenge</hi>. The news reports
        apparently accepted the captains' claim that they had responded to such a challenge,
        quoting their language: "we were completely successful" and "we have discovered the best
        route which does exist across the continent of North America," an erroneous claim. Almost
        four decades later westward settlers avoided the expedition's difficult passage and
        traveled through the 
        <name type="place" key="South Pass">South Pass</name>, an easier way over the 
        <name type="place" key="Continental Divide">Continental Divide</name>. But it was true
        that the original Corps successfully returned to the 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>area intact, having lost only one
        man.</p>
            <p>Scholars point to another aspect of being a hero: 
        <hi rend="italic">showing distinctive physical skills</hi>. The news accounts of the
        captains' letter emphasized physical strength and endurance. The article quoted 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>saying, "we undertook a
        laborious portage of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">falls of the Missouri (the
        Great Falls)</name>," and "we penetrated the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</name>at the distance of 71 miles
        above the upper part of the portage." The reprinted 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>/
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>letter mostly told of the Corps' 
        <hi rend="italic">challenges</hi>from their viewpoint, with such specificities as that
        they "passed mountains almost inaccessible"; "we suffered every thing which hunger, cold
        and fatigue could impose"; and "we grew sick upon eating the food to which they (Indians)
        were accustomed." The news story also repeated claims about environmental challenges: "the
        river being low at this season, we experienced much difficulty in descending," and "we
        found it [
        <hi rend="italic">the river</hi>] obstructed by a great number of difficult and dangerous
        rapids, in passing of which our pirogues several times filled and the men escaped narrowly
        with their lives."
        <ref target="n42" n="42"/>
            </p>
            <p>Likewise, the heroic trait of possessing 
        <hi rend="italic">admirable moral characteristics</hi>, such as in leadership, appeared in
        the early news accounts. The Corps' admiration of the captains had been highlighted,
        because of the care they took of their men. This letter recounted the captains'
        self-satisfaction with respect to their leadership abilities: "We have not lost a man
        since we left the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, a circumstance which I
        assure you is a pleasing consideration." 
        <ref target="n43" n="43"/>
            </p>
            <p>Initially, the newspapers, regardless of partisan leanings, expressed happiness
        regarding the Corps' return and quoted 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>'s statement about
        his "unspeakable joy" at their return. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had written 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>in October, "I salute you with
        sincere affection."
        <ref target="n44" n="44"/>Yet when 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>gave his annual message to
        Congress in December, he said little about the Corps' return and grouped 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s report together along with the
        other explorations of the Louisiana Territory.
        <ref target="n45" n="45"/>As quoted in the 
        <hi rend="italic">National Intelligencer</hi>, 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>said the expedition "had all
        the success which could have been expected.... It is but justice to say, that Messrs. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke</name>[
        <hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and their brave companions, have, by this arduous service,
        deserved well of their country.
        <ref target="n46" n="46"/>The President lauded such exemplary citizenship.</p>
            <p>Newspapers across the country helped record the captains' travel east, made separately
        from 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>to the capital. Going first, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s journey to 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington, D.C.</name>, went slowly, primarily
        because residents in every town and village insisted on honoring him.
        <ref target="n47" n="47"/>Newspapers reported his stops, and their reports were repeated:
        "
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>arrived at this place on
        Thursday last, and on Saturday morning proceeded on his journey to the city of 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>...."
        <ref target="n48" n="48"/>Newspapers, even territorial newspapers, became important
        sources of information for the new nation.</p>
            <p>After three months, the 31 December 
        <hi rend="italic">National Intelligencer</hi>announced 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s arrival in 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>. "Few expeditions have been
        conducted with more patience, perseverance, or success, and we have no doubt that the
        curiosity of the reader will be fully satisfied by the statements," which were to come
        that day from 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>. Championing 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, it added, "it will be seen that
        he has rendered very important services to his country.
        <ref target="n49" n="49"/>
            </p>
            <p>Just as 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>residents had done, the citizens
        of 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>wanted to honor the expedition's
        return. For two weeks, they waited for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to arrive before going ahead with a
        celebratory dinner. The 
        <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer</hi>carried an account of the banquet, given by official 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>.
        <ref target="n50" n="50">50</ref>Apparently, the toasts primarily saluted 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, highlighting his patriotism,
        bravery, valor, and honor. For example, one toast was to "
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Meriwether Lewis</name>–Patriotic,
        enlightened, and brave who had the spirit to undertake and the valour to execute an
        expedition, which reflects honor on his country." Another published toast saluted the
        still-traveling 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and other Corps members, "
        <name type="person" key="Clarke, William">Capt. Clarke</name>[
        <hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and the other brave companions of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>—Their patriotic and manly
        perseverance entitles them to the approbation of their countrymen."
        <ref target="n51" n="51"/>By quoting the toasts, the newspaper emphasized the Corps'
        fortitude, patience, and perseverance. Without using the word "hero," it described the
        classical qualities of a hero, valor, bravery, honor, and perseverance, while adding the
        new attributes of American enlightenment and patriotism.</p>
            <p>European heroes were often honored with special odes. So, too, in the new United
        States, 
        <name type="person" key="Barlow, Joel">Joel Barlow</name>, the poet of the day, penned a
        special verse for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s dinner. The 
        <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer</hi>printed his "elegant and glowing stanzas" about the
        expedition. 
        <name type="person" key="Barlow, Joel">Barlow</name>played 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>the supreme compliment by urging
        that the last major waterway the Corps had descended, the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>, be renamed Lewis River:

               </quote>
               <name type="person" key="Barlow, Joel">Barlow</name>'s poetry, then, offered the first
        printed reference to a Corps member as a hero: "Let our Occident stream bear the young
        hero's name...." 
        <name type="person" key="Barlow, Joel">Barlow</name>honored 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, age 33, by suggesting that his
        name be attached to a major river and thus transcend his lifetime, another trait
        characteristic of heroes.</p>
            <p>Such hyperbole was too much for the Federalists who reacted publicly. Two months later
        the 
        <hi rend="italic">Monthly Anthology</hi>and 
        <hi rend="italic">Boston Review</hi>satirized 
        <name type="person" key="Barlow, Joel">Barlow</name>'s puffery in more poetry, "On the
        Discoveries of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>." The writer may have
        sarcastically emphasized what the Corps did not do, yet this writer accepted hero
        references, "Heroick, sure, the toil must be travel through the woods, sir... " and
        "Come—let us all subscribe, and ask The Hero to a dinner ...." As to changing the name of

            <p>The writer of this poem, now believed to be well-known Federalist 
        <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">John Quincy Adams</name>,
        <ref target="n54" n="54"/>may have been critical, but even he had to recognize the Corps'
        feats. In fact, while 
        <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">Adams</name>noted the "bombast in Politicks
        as well as Poetry," he commented, "our intention is not to depreciate the merits of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>'s publick services. We
        think highly of the spirit and judgment, with which he has executed the duty undertaken by
        him, and we rejoice at the rewards bestowed by congress upon him and his companions,"
        <ref target="n55" n="55"/>referring to the accrued pay and the land grants. Although 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was now caught between the
        Federalist and Democrat–Republican parties, both 
        <name type="person" key="Barlow, Joel">Barlow</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">Adams</name>admired 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>as a hero. Again, the word "hero"
        appeared in print only in the published toasts and poetry about 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>. The early news accounts of the
        exploration described heroic attributes, but without using the term.</p>
            <p>The welcomes and dinners and celebrations expressed laudatory responses to the
        expedition. Indeed, the public demanded more—a full account of the trip. The news stories
        of the risks, challenges, and narrow escapes only prickled readers' interest for an
        immediate publication of the journals. Americans waited and waited for the captains'
        journals, but the long time lag meant that the Corps' findings would not stay alive as
        news. Unauthorized accounts and other journal publications,
        <ref target="n56" n="56"/>such as those by expedition member 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>,
        <ref target="n57" n="57"/>began to saturate the market.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>procrastinated and the captains
        had difficulty finding sponsorship after the end of 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s Presidency; printing costs
        were prohibitive even for abbreviated versions. Meanwhile, the country's attention had
        moved on to other prominent events and other brave men who took risks for the country,
        such as 
        <name type="person" key="Jackson, Andrew">Andrew Jackson</name>during the War of 1812. By
        the time the excerpts were finally printed in 1814,
        <ref target="n58" n="58"/>the public appeal was lost. Moreover, the captains saw so much
        that they restricted their initial letter account and did not highlight their unusual
        scientific and anthropological discoveries; the excerpts included none of these detailed
        observations and few discussions of Native Americans. In fact, for the next ninety years
        and through twenty-two editions, nineteenth-century Americans had only these abbreviated 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>journals.
        <ref target="n59" n="59"/>
            </p>
            <p>Without the depth of the discoveries, the expedition's efforts appeared to be no more
        than a great national adventure,
        <ref target="n60" n="60"/>adding little beyond what was already known. To coincide with
        the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>centennial in 1904, 
        <name type="person" key="Thwaites, Reuben">Reuben Thwaites</name>edited, annotated, and
        published the original journals." Only then did the public learn of the Corps' vast
        naturalist and scientific discoveries. The later discussion of the geographic exploration
        pointed out how the captains had named rivers and peaks for national leaders and even for
        Corps members. As 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>had requested, the Corps had
        scientifically recorded their observations.</p>

            <p>In the nation's history, the expedition nevertheless transcended the country's early
        national era. The captains' names lasted beyond their lifetimes, as seen in 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>–
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>College and

        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>College. Towns were designated as
        Lewiston and Clarkson. In the twentieth century, parks, roadside markers, paintings,
        books, plays, and films about the Corps of Discovery became part of the public's
        awareness. By the time of the expedition's centennial, 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>became another prominent Corps figure
        to be honored by statues, books, and plays. During the latter part of the twentieth

            </p>
            <p>Like the ancient Odyssey, the Corps also survived a perilous journey, but unlike

        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>wrote of their own amazing
        deeds. Although, in accordance with conventions of the time, they never used the word
        hero, their joint letter, as the initial news account of the expedition, described a
        successful heroic feat. As the more educated of the two leaders, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>would have been aware of the
        European epic poetry, biblical stories, and ancient heroic tales and myths."
        <ref target="n63" n="63"/>Such a cultural background might have offered an acceptable way
        to tell a journey story of risks, dangers, challenges, and then a successful return.
        Whether or not because of this knowledge, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s joint public letter about the
        Corps' journey did frame the larger story of the expedition by using heroic language. They
        described an exemplary response to the risks and challenges of following the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>to its source and continuing
        to the 
        <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>; a demonstration of
        distinctive physical skills in the face of difficult weather, treacherous terrain, and
        threatening Indians, as well as admirable moral leadership during various crises.</p>
            <p>As the most mentioned member of the 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>Expedition, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>appeared to relish such
        attention. Following the initial reprint of 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s letter in 1806, it was 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>who received the greater public
        notice, especially at the capital's major celebratory dinner. The toasts and poetry may
        have indirectly celebrated the entire Corps, but 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>was the most designated
        representative and the only one directly called a hero. Appointed by the President to lead
        the expedition, he had faced challenges, shown superhuman mental and physical strength,
        even encountered the "exotic other," numerous Native American tribes, and demonstrated
        admirable moral leadership. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>fit a hero status in 1806–1807,
        even in a nation espousing egalitarian ideals. As a recognized leader and educated
        gentleman, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>represented the era's notable
        public figure. By being connected to a founding father, initially as secretary to 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Thomas Jefferson</name>, he was a
        political elite. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>' status may have fit the
        lingering eighteenth–century enlightenment hero, by having the publicly known virtue of
        curiosity in the pursuit of new practical knowledge for the good of mankind.
        <ref target="n64" n="64"/>
            </p>
            <p>Knowledge unrecorded publicly can be knowledge lost, as the full 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>journals demonstrated. It took almost
        a century and a centennial celebration for the expedition's findings to be known. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>' procrastination was only one
        deterrent. In fact, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>began falling from public
        admiration in 1807 as he became more and more mired in political controversies. When the
        other Corps members began publishing their accounts, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>belittled their journals publicly
        or tried to stop their efforts, conflicts the partisan press noted.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s subsequent difficulties
        manifested in his leadership problems as governor of the Territory of 
        <name type="place" key="Louisiana">Louisiana</name>. As a co-captain of what was
        essentially a triumphant military expedition, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>had been necessarily autocratic,
        successfully so. Apparently having peaked in his early thirties as a military leader, 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was unable to adjust to the
        intrigues and demands of democratic territorial leadership. The frontier was full of
        political machinations and demanded the democratic tenets of continuous negotiation,
        compromise, and checks by superiors. By 1809 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>could no longer protect him
        from numerous accusations of corruption. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>' moral stature finally came into
        question in 1809, when he appeared to have committed suicide,
        <ref target="n65" n="65"/>an irreligious act. By the time the journals were published in
        1814, an enlightenment hero such as 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>was an outmoded concept. In the
        growing nation, where national interest focused on the frontier, public admiration turned
        toward the enterprising frontiersman.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, on the other hand, a western
        soldier, was more of the self–reliant frontier leader. In 1806 he had been modest and
        reticent about his personal role in the expedition's success. With his rank secret and his
        co-captainship unofficial, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s concerted attempt to remain in the
        back-ground after his initial letter to his brother may have been because of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>'s attempt to obtain congressional
        approval for 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s captain's commission.
        <ref target="n6" n="66"/>In any case, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>declined credit for the Corps'
        successful return. He told the citizens of 
        <name type="place" key="Fincastle, Ind.">Fincastle</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Indiana">Indiana</name>, "Gentlemen, we ought to assign the
        general safety of the party to a singular interposition of providence, and not to the
        wisdom of those who commanded the expedition."
        <ref target="n67" n="67"/>
               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>also appeared to avoid public
        accolades and did not arrive in time for the 
        <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington</name>banquet and ball celebrations,
        although the city had waited for him. 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s post–expedition career surpassed
        his co–leadership of the Corps of Discovery. Subsequently, as governor of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>Territory and longtime Superintendent of
        Indian Affairs, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>became a beloved figure in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, "eminently endeared to all who
        came within the sphere of his acquaintance," recounted the 
        <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi>(
        <name type="place" key="Missouri">Missouri</name>) upon his death three decades later.
        <ref target="n68" n="68"/>
            </p>
            <p>But if in 1806–1807 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>could not fit the tenets of an
        enlightenment hero because he was not an educated 
        <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>gentleman associated with the nation's
        power elite, those years were too early for the frontier hero or the backwoods natural
        man. Only later did 
        <name type="person" key="Bowie, Jim">Jim Bowie</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Crockett, Davy">Davy Crockett</name>, and 
        <name type="person" key="Boone, Daniel">Daniel Boone</name>become designated heroes.
        <ref target="n69" n="69">69</ref>The biography of "Pioneer and Scout" used the word "hero"

        hair–breadth escapes from animals and Indians.
        <ref target="n70" n="70"/>
            </p>
            <p>Identification is the first step in acknowledging a hero. Other Corps members became
        publicly known by their newsworthy characteristics: 
        <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd</name>as the expedition's only
        death; 
        <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>as the controversial author of
        the first published journals. 
        <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name>later became known not as a Corps
        member, but as a 
        <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone</name>explorer and fur trader who
        escaped the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfeet</name>Indian captures.
        <ref target="n71" n="71"/>A decade or more after the Corps' return, British and American
        authors described 
        <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>'s mountain man escapades, which
        heralded his frontiersman hero characteristics: perseverance, ingenuity, strength, and
        skill.</p>
            <p>For almost a century other members of the expedition remained invisible. Only later
        would they attain hero status. As noted, as the explorers were leaving 
        <name type="place" key="Dubois River">Woods River</name>in 1804 one newspaper had
        mentioned an unidentified, knowledgeable Indian woman. Newspapers had long carried
        accounts of captives and battles with Indians. But for the most part, individual Native
        Americans, such as 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, were invisible, no matter how often
        she was mentioned in the journals, and how much 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>stressed the importance of
        Indian contacts.
        <ref target="n72" n="72"/>One reason may have been the difficult pronunciation and the
        spelling of her name. All of the journals had trouble referring to her other than "the
        Indian woman," or "the fur-trader's wife" and when her name was given, it was spelled
        phonetically with dashes. Moreover, before the Corps's public reappearance in St. Louis,
        she and her family left the expedition.</p>
            <p>By the time of the expedition's centennial, however, 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was the new focus of books, plays, and
        stories as well as imaginative paintings and statues in 
        <name type="place" key="St. Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, 
        <name type="place" key="Portland, Oreg.">Portland</name>, and along the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name>. The timing was ripe for
        public inclusion of this woman: she fulfilled a public need, given the romantic response
        to the decline of the Indian by the end of the century.
        <ref target="n73" n="73"/>Too, the supporters of the Women's Suffrage movement saw in 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>a national hero. At the 
        <name type="place" key="Portland, Oreg.">Portland</name>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>Exposition in 1905, 
        <name type="person" key="Anthony, Susan B.">Susan B. Anthony</name>called 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>"one of the greatest of American
        heroines."
        <ref target="n74" n="74"/>Later, scholars found that suffragists and others magnified her
        expedition role and virtues beyond credibility.
        <ref target="n75" n="75"/>Yet, 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>'s hero status continues; by 2000, she
        became only the second woman honored with a U.S. coin.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s slave, remained relatively unknown
        throughout the nineteenth century. Through twenty-two editions of the journals during the
        nineteenth century, the press disregarded 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, although the journals had highlighted his
        strength and his hunting skills. Newspapers had published stories about slaves, runaway
        slaves, and freed slaves, and earlier, the poetry of 
        <name type="person" key="Wheatley, Phyllis">Phyllis Wheatley</name>. Later, the press
        published lectures by such notables as 
        <name type="person" key="Douglass, Frederick">Frederick Douglass</name>. Still, no public
        mention was made of 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, the first African-American explorer. Then, on
        5 January 1879, much beyond his possible lifetime,
        <ref target="n76" n="76"/>the New York Times published an obituary referring to 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>. Calling him "Tom," without a last name, the
        Times falsely noted 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>'s death: "THE 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">LEWIS</name>AND 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">CLARK</name>EXPEDITION. Death of "Old Tom"
        Supposed to be the Last Survivor." Taken from the 
        <hi rend="italic">Charlottesville</hi>(Va.) 
        <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, 3 January, this four–paragraph account not only
        erroneously attributed 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>'s former slave ownership to 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>, but also
        misidentified his death. Except for headline and the final paragraph, the article
        discusses the expedition and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>' death. 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>'s contribution to the Corps' success was
        de-emphasized and this misidentification indicates his invisibility.
        <ref target="n77" n="77"/>Only during the latter decades of the twentieth century during
        the Civil Rights movement did writers focus on 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>.
        <ref target="n78" n="78"/>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps, more inclusive eras would recognize not just 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>but other Corps members and give them hero
        designations. As Wecter wrote, "in a democracy the hero must be the people's choice."
        <ref target="n79" n="79"/>During the twentieth century, American society became more
        publicly inclusive for women, Native Americans, and African Americans. Yet, someone has to
        signal publicly that inclusion and hero designation. Press coverage is but one means.</p>

            <head>Conclusions</head>
            <p>In 1806, the partisan press was at the center of the communication infrastructure that
        promoted nation building. Even outlying newspapers such as the 
        <hi rend="italic">Frankfort Palladium</hi>became important sources of information. The 
        <hi rend="italic">Palladium</hi>'s publication of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s joint letter was the usual
        convention for disseminating distant news, prior to the telegraph and newspaper
        correspondents. Unique among the published letter writers about the Corps' homecoming, 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>as an expedition captain was
        identified as the correspondent for this report. The political prominence of a
        presidential expedition guaranteed recognition and publication.</p>
            <p>The captains' co-authored letter additionally highlighted themselves and indirectly
        other Corps members with heroic referents. Their phrases and words became the repeated
        news descriptions of the challenges, the dangers, the risks, the feats, and the Corps'
        success for the newspapers and magazines. No other sources were used. Newspaper readers,
        along with the elected officials, learned what occurred on the expedition through the
        captains' own written words.</p>
            <p>Whether 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were aware of it or not, by
        describing the expedition, their joint letter gave the classic heroic characteristics of
        great physical skills, of exemplary responses to a set of challenges, and of admirable
        moral characteristics, not just for 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and the reticent 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, but also indirectly for the other
        Corps explorers. Newspapers repeated these referents. In 1806 and early 1807, the classic
        epic hero remained the model, yet only fleetingly. The heroes of the old world were of
        noble birth and were "subjects" of a ruler, serving with honor. The new nation's hero was
        an independent citizen who served the country with ingenuity, perseverance, enterprise,
        bravery, and valor. 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s response and the
        newspapers' introductions to 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s letter consistently repeated those
        latter attributes. Through the celebratory toasts and poetry, newspapers published the
        "hero" label, and added a public attribute that fit an emerging nation: an exemplary
        citizen. In 1807, only 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>enjoyed that
        status.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">John Quincy Adams</name>' response to the
        adulation of the Corps pointed to the tension between the hero of old and the new American
        hero. Despite being a well–known Federalist and vocal critic of the 
        <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>administration, 
        <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">Adams</name>recognized the exploratory
        achievements of the expedition and 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>. Yet, 
        <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">Adams</name>' acknowledgement of the Corps'
        worth had an accolade limit. In 1807, the renaming of the 
        <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia River</name>after 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>would be an excessive reaction for
        
        <name type="person" key="Adams, John Quincy">Adams</name>.</p>
            <p>The news coverage added some specifically American attributes to the classic hero. An
        American hero had to be selfless, in an expanding nation full of exemplary citizens. The
        new American notable was a republican hero, marked not by the exceptional intellectual
        ability or elite birth of the founding fathers, but rather as a publicly spirited,
        sacrificing citizen, regardless of origin. The representative Corps of Discovery member
        served as American hybrid for the hero concept, a bridge between the old kind of
        enlightenment elites of the revolutionary patriots to the new kind of democratic notable,
        a pragmatic and enterprising new citizen, so identified with the Jacksonian era by the
        1830s. The early news response to the expedition's return points to an American new
        national identity.</p>
            <p>Other expedition explorers would become known as America's national heroes during new
        societal needs in the midst of the centennial celebrations and the complete publication of
        the journals. The news stories about the long–lost explorers would laud their challenges
        and the feats as mostly "common men" with a more democratic recognition to the American
        "every person," usually acknowledged a century or so later.</p>
