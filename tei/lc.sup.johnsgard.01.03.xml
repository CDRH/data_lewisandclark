               <p>Although the extreme southeastern boundary of 
          <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>was reached on August 21, 1804,
          the first actual 
          <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>campsite was made on August 23,
          when the group camped near the present site of 
          <name type="place" key="Vermillion, S. Dak.">Vermillion</name>, 
          <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>. On that same day they killed
          their first bison, near the present site of 
          <name type="place" key="Ionia, Nebr.">Ionia</name>, 
          <name type="place" key="Dixon County, Nebr.">Dixon County</name>. On the 24th they
          passed a "bluff of blue clay," the so-called 
          <name type="place" key="Burning Bluffs">Burning Bluffs</name>. The surface of this rocky
          outcrop was unaccountably warm to the touch, as if it had been burning from within, a
          phenomenon now believed to have been caused by chemical oxidation. By August 28 the
          group had reached the present site of 
          <name type="place" key="Yankton, S. Dak.">Yankton</name>, 
          <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>, where they remained until
          August 31, holding a council with the local 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yankton Sioux</name>natives. On
          September 7 they observed a treeless dome on the south side of the river that they named
          
          <name type="place" key="Old Baldy (Dome)">"The Cupola" (now known as Old Baldy)</name>.
          At the base of this conical dome they discovered a colony of black-tailed prairie dogs,
          a species then new to science. After the entire group spent most of a day fetching and
          pouring about five barrels of water down one hole, the resident rodent was finally
          evicted and caught. Several others were shot and their skins preserved. Some prairie
          dogs were also eaten during the expedition and were considered fine table fare. Two
          other members of the prairie-dog community that directly depend on prairie dogs for
          their own survival, the burrowing owl (
          <hi rend="italic">Athene cunicularia</hi>) and the black-footed ferret (
          <hi rend="italic">Mustela nigripes</hi>), were not encountered. The ferret was not
          discovered and described scientifically for another half-century, but by 1900 it had
          already been virtually eliminated from 
          <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>as well as from most of the 
          <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>. It was one of the first 
          <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>endemic species to be listed
          under the Endangered Species Act. The 
          <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>race of the burrowing owl was
          discovered on the plains of western 
          <name type="place" key="Nebraska">Nebraska</name>in 1820. The rapidly declining
          burrowing owl may also soon be a candidate for similar nationally threatened or
          endangered listing.</p>

          north in 
          <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>, large herds of bison were
          seen, as well as elk and deer. They passed the mouth of the 
          <name type="place" key="White River">White River</name>on September 15, soon
          encountering "multitudes" of prairie dogs and vast herds of bison and antelope. By
          September 20 they had reached the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Big Bend of the">Big Bend of the Missouri
          River</name>, sending two men by horseback across the narrow peninsula to hunt and await
          their arrival around the enormous bend. Here the first female pronghorn was killed, as
          well as several mule deer. A coyote was also killed, and was identified as a small
          species of prairie wolf. On September 24 they reached what they called the 
          <name type="place" key="Bad (Teton) River (S. Dak.)">"Teton" River (now known as the Bad
          River</name>, its original English name), so named by the group because of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton (Brule) Lakotas</name>who
          lived along it. Several days were spent interacting with this tribe, including some
          distinctly unfriendly encounters, and it was not until September 28 that they again
          departed upstream. They soon passed several abandoned villages of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>("
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Rickaras</name>"), and by October 8 met

          Creek</name>(now 
          <name type="place" key="Campbell County, S. Dak.">Campbell County</name>), a short

          they camped near

                  <name type="place" key="Cannonball (Bullet) River">Cannonball River</name>on October 18,
          in what is the present-day 
          <name type="place" key="Standing Rock Reservation (N. Dak.)">Standing Rock
          Reservation</name>, and on the 19th counted 53 herds of bison and 3 elk herds, all in
          view at a single time. They soon began to encounter abandoned 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages as well as old 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>villages. There were also

          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was living with a French fur trader,
          
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Touissant Charbonneau</name>. She had
          been captured and abducted near

          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>arrived at an active 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>village site, a location
          they selected for their winter quarters and named 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>. Later known as 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Clark (N. Dak.)">Fort Clark</name>, it was located in what
          is now the southeastern corner of 
          <name type="place" key="Mercer County, N. Dak.">Mercer County</name>. They were
          approximately 1,600 river miles up the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>from their starting point and
          roughly halfway across their transcontinental route.</p>
               <p>The expedition spent the winter of 1804-5 at 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>, not departing again
          until April 7, 1805. At that point the Corps of Discovery consisted of 32 persons.
          Besides their basic exploratory party of 28 men, they had added 2 interpreters,
          including 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Touissant Charbonneau</name>as well as 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>and her infant son, 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Baptiste</name>, born only
          about two months previously. The keelboat and its crew of eleven men were sent back to 
          <name type="place" key="Saint Louis, Mo.">St. Louis</name>, along with many specimens
          and artifacts that were destined for 
          <name type="place" key="Washington D.C.">Washington DC</name>. Among them were live
          prairie dogs and magpies, 60 preserved plant specimens, a variety of Native American
          materials, and various skins and skeletons.</p>
               <p>The Corps then headed upstream, passing the mouth of the 
          <name type="place" key="Little Missouri (E-mâh-tark',-Ah'-zhah) River">Little Missouri
          River</name>on April 12 and reaching the mouth of the 
          <name type="place" key="Yellowstone River">Yellowstone River</name>on April 26, where
          they were only a few miles from the present-day boundary of 
          <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>. Between this point and the present
          boundary, 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Union (N. Dak.)">Fort Union</name>was built in 1830 and
          operated as a frontier trading post for some time before being abandoned. They entered
          what is now eastern 
          <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>on April 27, 1805, camping just a few
          miles upstream.</p>
               <p>The return trip was much more rapid and far less rewarding in terms of biological
          discovery. Little time was wasted during this phase, especially after 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis's</name>narrow escape from
          eight 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name>men during his

          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Marias River</name>of western 
          <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>, together with three of his men. After
          that hazardous encounter the four men quickly returned to the

              Society, and according to Joseph Brown one of their songs was as follows: "I am a
              Fox. I am supposed to die. If there is anything difficult, if there is anything
              dangerous, that is mine to do."</p>

              His description perfectly fits the yellow-shafted form of the northern flicker.
              About four decades later, Audubon encountered flickers that were intermediate in

              same part of the upper

              now regarded as only racially distinct, as a broad zone of intermingled genetic
              types occurs in this general plains region. Northern flicker populations have
              declined significantly in North America during the last four decades, as have at
