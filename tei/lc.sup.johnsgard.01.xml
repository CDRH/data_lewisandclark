            <p>The purpose of this book is to identify and describe the Great Plains animals and
        plants that were encountered and described by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>and their Corps of Discovery two
        centuries ago during their famous exploratory expedition of the Louisiana Purchase
        territories. It also attempts to place both the organisms they discovered in an ecological
        framework and these two explorers in a historical context as biologists. It is intended to
        serve as a bicentennial tribute to this remarkable exploration of the then-unknown lands
        comprising the Louisiana Purchase. The bicentennial of this epic journey seems an
        especially appropriate time to review and marvel at the expedition's accomplishments, and
        to reflect on the changes in the land and its associated biota that have occurred during
        the subsequent two hundred years of American history.</p>
            <p>The animals selected for inclusion in this survey represent as many as possible of the
        identifiable species of vertebrates that were initially described, or at least apparently
        discovered, by the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition while crossing the Great
        Plains as well as those previously known species that were described in sufficient detail
        to permit identification with some degree of confidence. Special attention has been given
        to those animal species encountered by the Corps of Discovery that were previously
        unknown, or ones for which important new biological information was obtained during the
        expedition. However, a few distinctly western and montane-adapted animals such as the blue
        grouse (
        <hi rend="italic">Dendragapus obscurus</hi>) and pinyon jay (
        <hi rend="italic">Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus</hi>) were excluded. Both of these
        forest-adapted birds were encountered at the very edge of the Great Plains in western
        Montana. A few additional western or northern species, such as the Columbian ground
        squirrel, lynx, and moose, were likewise deemed to be of doubtful species identification
        or of questionable geographic affinities. These species have been included in the survey,
        but their names are set off by parentheses.</p>
            <p>The plants chosen for inclusion in the text represent all those species collected on
        the Great Plains and preserved as herbarium specimens that are known to be still extant.
        Selecting the western limits of the Great Plains in order to decide which plant species to
        include was a subjective exercise, but those species whose ranges fall largely or entirely
        outside the coverage of the 
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas of the Flora of the Great Plains</hi>were excluded. These include
        antelope bush (
        <hi rend="italic">Purshia tridentata</hi>), golden currant (
        <hi rend="italic">Ribes aureum</hi>), moundscale (
        <hi rend="italic">Atriplex gardneri</hi>), and common monkey-flower (
        <hi rend="italic">Mimulus guttatus</hi>). The comments made in the text as to Native
        American ritual or medicinal uses of plants derive mostly from Gilmore (1977) and
        Kindscher (1992); the latter reference is especially valuable as to plant medicinal
        properties.</p>
            <p>This summary of the animals and plants encountered by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>is organized in three parts,
        corresponding to three broad and roughly equal geographic regions, at least in terms of
        river distances traveled. Accompanying the summary are maps of the major campsites and
        associated dates spent by the Corps of Discovery in each of these three regions. The Corps
        spent much more time exploring during the upstream, outward-bound phase in 1804 and 1805
        than during the return journey, and this first part of the expedition was by far the
        richest from a biological standpoint. Almost no new species were discovered during the
        return trip in 1806, and the associated campsites are not mapped.</p>
            <p>In general, the animals and plants that the expedition encountered are described only
        for that phase of the expedition where they were first encountered. However, a few
        especially important mammals (e.g., bison, pronghorn, elk, wolf, and grizzly bear) are
        discussed in two or all three of the geographic regions recognized here. Names of
        present-day states or counties as well as current town locations have often been used to
        provide convenient geographic reference points for the reader. Included are drawings of
        all the certainly discovered or initially well- described vertebrates, as well as some
        representative plants, especially species of genera having special ritual or medicinal
        value for Native Americans, such as 
        <hi rend="italic">Artemisia</hi>, 
        <hi rend="italic">Juniperus</hi>, and 
        <hi rend="italic">Nicotiana</hi>. The names used in the text for Native American tribes
        are modern ones, although alternate names used by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>are typically shown
        parenthetically.</p>
            <p>When this book had nearly gone to press, H. Wayne Phillips's 
        <hi rend="italic">Plants of the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>Expedition</hi>(2003) appeared. He
        illustrated more than 80 tallgrass and high-plains species, including some that are not
        included here because herbarium specimens are not known to exist.</p>

            <p>This publication was stimulated by plans for "The Nature of Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on the Great Plains," a symposium and
        associated art exhibition coinciding with the bicentennial celebration of the 1804-6 Lewis
        and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition, to be held in Lincoln,
        Nebraska, during the spring of 2004. The art exhibition is being sponsored primarily by
        the University of Nebraska's Center for Great Plains Studies, to which all royalties for
        this publication have been assigned. The author expresses his deepest appreciation to
        Reece Summers, curator of the Great Plains Art Center, who first suggested the project, to
        Gary Moulton, whose monumental work on the Lewis and

            <p>When 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>set off up the Missouri River
        in mid-May of 1804 with their 26-man contingent (3 sergeants, 22 privates, and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s slave 
        <name type="person" key="York">York</name>) and about 10 additional boatmen and
        interpreters, they had no detailed knowledge of what lands or adventures lay before them.
        When the group returned more than two years later, in late September of 1806, they had
        made more discoveries of landscapes, rivers, native cultures, zoology, and botany of our
        continent than has any North American scientific expedition, either before or since. They
        traversed upstream across the entire Great Plains region, which for present purposes is
        defined as including that part of the Missouri Valley between the current Missouri-Kansas
        border and the vicinity of Three Forks, Montana, where three mountain-fed rivers merge to
        form the Missouri. By the time they reached what is now western Montana in late July of
        1805 and were about to challenge the Rockies, they had already ascended nearly 4,000 feet
        of elevation. They also had explored and carefully described roughly 2,500 river miles of
        the Missouri Valley since leaving the Mississippi River, a task that by itself represents
        a heroic if not Herculean physical effort.</p>
            <p>Over the 14-month period during which the explorers crossed the Great Plains on their
        way to the Pacific they collected specimens of plants later found to represent at least 20
        new species, not counting an unknown number of additional specimens that either were lost
        or damaged beyond repair in the course of the expedition or have disappeared from any
        present-day museum or herbarium records.</p>
            <p>Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>also discovered or carefully
        described for the first time at least seven Great Plains species of mammals, including the
        pronghorn, grizzly bear, swift fox, black-tailed prairie dog, white-tailed jackrabbit,
        bushy-tailed woodrat, and mule deer. The Columbian ground squirrel was first encountered,
        and thus discovered, in western Montana, but it was not carefully described until after
        the group arrived in Oregon. Several Great Plains birds representing new genera (depending
        on the taxonomy source chosen) were described for the first time, including the greater
        sage-grouse, common poorwill, McCown's longspur, and Lewis's namesake species, the Lewis's
        woodpecker. The woodpecker, whose previously unique genus 
        <hi rend="italic">Asyndesmus</hi>has recently been merged with 
        <hi rend="italic">Melanerpes</hi>, was first seen along the edge of the Big Belt Mountains
        near present-day Helena, Montana. However, this woodland-edge woodpecker was not actually
        collected until the following spring, near Kamiah, Idaho. A skin of the Lewis's woodpecker
        is in Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology and is perhaps the only remaining
        intact museum specimen of all the animals collected during the expedition. The least tern
        was also carefully described and measured, based on two specimens they had shot. There can
        be no doubt that these five species of birds, at minimum, were discovered by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on the Great Plains.</p>
            <p>In his valuable summary of the natural history of the entire expedition, Paul R.
        Cutright listed a total of 30 then-undescribed vertebrate species or subspecies that were
        noted by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during the Great Plains phase and
        possibly as many as 9 additional ones that were encountered but not adequately described
        to identify them with certainty. Virginia Holmgren more recently summarized the bird
        discoveries of the entire expedition, listing 25 that she believed were sufficiently well
        described to warrant "discovery" status, 9 species that might have been considered as
        newly discovered if they had been better described, and 11 species that were already well
        known by some common name but had not yet been formally described and named
        scientifically. In the category of definitely discovered Great Plains birds, she listed
        the trumpeter swan, greater sage-grouse, semipalmated plover, mountain plover, upland
        sandpiper, long-billed curlew, least tern, common poorwill, Lewis's woodpecker, Sprague's
        pipit, McCown's longspur, western meadowlark, and Brewer's blackbird. Of these, the
        mountain plover and upland sandpiper are distinctly questionable as to their
        identification. There is no evidence that the highly elusive Sprague's pipit (
        <hi rend="italic">Anthus spragueii</hi>) was ever seen, and the "small Kildee" observed
        along the Missouri River was probably the piping plover rather than the migratory and
        arctic-breeding semipalmated plover (
        <hi rend="italic">Charadrius semipalmatus</hi>). The identities of several Great Plains
        shorebirds mentioned briefly by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, such as the mountain plover and
        long-billed curlew, are especially problematic, as they used terms like "plover" and
        "curlew" rather indiscriminately for shorebirds generally. The tundra swan (
        <hi rend="italic">Cygnus columbianus</hi>) (previously known as the whistling swan) was
        initially described from observations made by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during the Pacific-slope phase of
        their expedition, but it or the trumpeter swan was seen earlier in what is now North
        Dakota. The trumpeter swan is the semiresidential breeding swan of the northern plains,
        whereas the arctic-breeding tundra swan is a spring and fall migrant only. Thus, the
        chances of their having seen the trumpeter swan on the northern plains were fairly good.
        At least eight previously unknown species—the trumpeter swan, greater sage-grouse, piping
        plover, least tern, common poorwill, Lewis's woodpecker, McCown's longspur, and western
        meadowlark—are well enough documented to count as having certainly been seen by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and the greater sage-grouse, least
        tern, and Lewis's woodpecker were as carefully described as any practicing ornithologist
        of the day might have done.</p>
            <p>Among reptiles and fishes, the western rattlesnake, western hognose snake, cutthroat
        trout, blue catfish, channel catfish, goldeye, and mountain sucker are certain or likely
        to have been newly discovered species. Several Great Plains mammal and reptile species
        that were known but only poorly documented, such as the bison, gray wolf, coyote, western
        garter snake, and bullsnake, were described by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>to a much greater degree than
        previously known. Many other plains animals that later were determined to represent new
        subspecies of previously known species were described, or at least mentioned, for the
        first time.</p>
            <p>For the trip collectively, nearly 100 previously unknown species or subspecies of
        vertebrate animals were encountered and variously described by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, judging from a recent summary by
        the Sierra Club. About 40 percent of these now have a state- or federal-level designation
        indicating that active protection or conservation concern is warranted. Of these, 13
        species are now classified as nationally endangered, including such classic Great Plains
        animals as the gray (prairie) wolf, whooping crane, and the interior race of the least
        tern. Great Plains species that were seen by the expedition members but are now federally
        threatened include the piping plover and grizzly bear. In the past two centuries the
        grizzly bear has changed from being the commonest large carnivore of the upper Missouri
        Valley to having been completely eradicated from it. Similar comments might be made of the
        gray wolf and the whooping crane.</p>
            <p>Cutright listed a total of 22 new plant species collected by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during their journey upstream between
        the mouth of the Kansas River and the vicinity of Three Forks, Montana. They include such
        plants as Indian tobacco (a species not native to the northern Great Plains), curly-top
        gumweed, and three species of sagebrush. A surprising number of the plants they collected
        were species believed by Native Americans to possess medicinal or other functional
        properties, and thus were very familiar to and highly valued by the tribes of the upper
        Missouri Valley. Most of them are now considered only to be weeds, and none is listed as
        threatened or endangered.</p>
            <p>The expedition's return trip across the Great Plains in 1806 was entirely downstream
        and consequently much faster, thus accounting for the expedition's far fewer zoological or
        botanical discoveries. However, at least five Great Plains plants collected during the
        return trip were later described as new species, according to Cutright. These included
        salt sage, red false mallow, gumbo evening primrose, black greasewood, and
        snow-on-the-mountain. These discoveries primarily consisted of plants obtained by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>while exploring the upper
        Marias River valley of northwestern Montana. Although no new plants were obtained, several
        new topographic features and some significant wildlife observations were documented by 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>on his separate route down
        the Yellowstone River.</p>
            <p>Frederick Pursh initially examined 155 of the roughly 200 plant specimens that
        successfully made their way back to the safety of the American Philosophical Society
        collections in Philadelphia. At the time he published his studies (1814), he classified
        four of the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>specimens as representing new genera
        and 123 as new species. A recent summary by James Reveal, Gary Moulton, and Alfred
        Schuyler indicate that Pursh associated the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>materials with 132 botanical names,
        94 of which were newly proposed by him and nearly all of which were taxonomically valid.
        These authors also determined that Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>collected at least 202 different
        kinds of plants. However, many of the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>specimens have since been lost. If
        all the plants encountered and variously described but not necessarily preserved by Lewis
        and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>during their entire expedition are
        tallied, 176 previously unknown species or subspecies can be listed, judging from a recent
        summary by the Sierra Club. At least 17 new plant species were discovered while the
        explorers were in the Great Plains region. Gary Moulton has summarized the specimen and
        archival data from all the herbarium sheets currently known to exist in volume 12 of his
        definitive 13-volume 
        <hi rend="italic">Journals of the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>Expedition</hi>. Names of the plants
        mentioned here follow this reference, sometimes with parenthetical synonyms of Latin or
        English vernacular names that have appeared in relevant literature, such as the books of
        Paul Cutright and Raymond Burroughs. The plants and animal species described in the text
        are arranged in alphabetic sequence using English names, and both the Latin and English
        names are those currently recognized as official. Alternate names given in quotes,
        including a few place names, are those used by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and their often innovative spelling
        has in such cases been retained.</p>
            <p>In the course of the expedition the group lived off the land, killing and eating almost
        anything they could. Burroughs compiled a list of game killed in the course of the
        expedition, largely for human consumption. At minimum, it included 1,001 deer, 35 elk, 227
        bison, 62 pronghorns, 113 beaver, 104 geese and brant, 48 shorebirds ("plovers"), 46
        grouse, 45 ducks and coots, and 9 turkeys. They also killed 43 grizzly bears, 23 black
        bears, 18 wolves, and 16 otters. This level of resource exploitation marked the beginning
        of a century of unrestrained wildlife slaughter in America, ending in the elimination of
        the bison, elk, gray wolf, and grizzly bear from the Great Plains, and the complete
        extinction of the passenger pigeon, Carolina parakeet, and Eskimo curlew.</p>
            <p>Exactly a century after the beginning of the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition (1903), President Theodore
        Roosevelt established in Florida the first of our national wildlife refuges, and the long
        road toward the preservation and restoration of our wildlife resources was at last under
        way. There are now more than 530 national wildlife refuges in the United States, of which
        the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge in Montana is much the largest of those
        situated along the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>route. There are 20 national
        grasslands, totaling 4 million acres, 17 of which are in the western Great Plains from
        North Dakota and Montana to New Mexico and Texas. There are now also 155 national forests,
        covering almost 200 million acres, including the Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>National Forest, located between the
        Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers of Montana. Also, there are 300 Indian reservations, now
        still home to members of about 500 tribes; ten of these reservations occur along the
        Missouri River between Nebraska and Montana, some of them supporting direct descendants of
        the people first encountered by Lewis and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>.</p>

               <head rend="center">Summary of Route and Major Biological Discoveries</head>
               <p>Until the Corps of Discovery reached the vicinity of present-day Kansas (the mouth of
          the Kansas River) in late June, they had not entered true wilderness and had made only
          one zoological discovery of interest—their capture on May 31, 1804, of several specimens
          of the eastern woodrat (
          <hi rend="italic">Neotoma floridana</hi>) in the woods near the mouth of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name>River, in 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name>and Calloway Counties. It was
          almost another month before they had pushed upstream far enough to reach the Kansas
          River, near which they saw Carolina parakeets and encountered two villages of Kansa
          natives.</p>
               <p>They reached the present border of Nebraska on July 11, camping near the mouth of the
          Big Nemaha River on the Nebraska side and the Tarkio River on the Missouri side. By then
          they were traveling along the so-named bald-pated hills. These tall, loess-formed hills
          of western Iowa were covered at their lower levels by hardwood forests, but often were
          capped with native prairie. On July 12, a short distance upstream from the mouth of the
          Big Nemaha River, they observed some low "artificial" mounds representing the sites of
          old Native American burial grounds. On the morning of July 30 the group arrived at a
          high bluff on the Nebraska side that is now part of Fort Calhoun. There they camped for
          four days and held a council with the assembled chiefs of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Oto Indians">Oto</name>e-Missouria tribe. This council
          was the first held between the natives of the central Missouri Valley and the U.S.
          government, and the bluff was thus named Council Bluff. It later became the site of Camp
          Missouri, the first military post in Nebraska, subsequently renamed Fort Calhoun.</p>
               <p>On August 13 the group passed 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>Creek and camped at an old 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>village that night. On August
          16 they seined more than 1,000 fish of at least ten species at this "fishing camp," none
          of which 
          <name type="person" key="Coues, Elliott">Elliott Coues</name>could identify with
          certainty on the basis of the names that the men used. Fish caught in the Nebraska-Iowa
          region and farther up the Missouri River did include some remarkably large catfish (see
          the Montana chapter in this book). They remained in the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>vicinity until August 19, and
          then began north again. On August 20, 1804, Sergeant 
          <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>died of a probable burst appendix
          and was buried on a high bluff just south of present-day 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>City, Iowa. The next day the
          group passed the mouth of the Big 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>River, camping in what is now
          Dakota County, Nebraska, with the South Dakota boundary on the opposite shore. The
          following day (August 22) they passed Ionia Creek and camped in what is now Union
          County, South Dakota. By September 7 they had passed out of what is now the shoreline of
          Boyd County, Nebraska, and were then entirely within the present boundaries of South
          Dakota.</p>
               <p>The return trip was relatively rapid, the party arriving in what is now northern Boyd
          County, Nebraska, on August 29, 1806. They passed the mouths of the Niobrara, James, and
          Vermillion Rivers on September 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On September 8 they passed
          Council Bluff, and the next day the mouth of the Platte River. They passed the mouth of
          the Big Nemaha River and entered present-day Kansas on September 11. On September 15
          they passed the mouth of the Kansas River and reentered Missouri. They reached the
          confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers on September 23, 1806, and were
          finally home.</p>

              tenacity, and its symbolic powers extended to the healing of sick children.</p>

                     <p>Beavers were first encountered on the outward journey near present-day
              Leavenworth, Kansas. They were seen again near Council Bluffs, Iowa, and after that
              were regularly encountered, being trapped at nearly every stopping point. In Montana
              alone they were reported from at least 33 locations. In his summary of the natural
              history of the expedition, Raymond Burroughs calculated that at least 113 beaver
              were killed over the entire expedition period. Three decades after the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition, Maximilian, Prince
              of Wied, reported that in a single year 25,000 beaver pelts were brought into Fort
              Union. Beavers were already becoming rare only a decade later, when John J. Audubon
              visited the same fort. At the time of the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition, North American
              beavers were highly valuable as pelts and were classified as the same species as the
              Old World beaver, but in 1820 they were recognized as separate types. After great
              overharvesting and near disappearance, the North American beaver has now recovered
              its former range and may be more common than at any time in the past century.</p>

              23, when they had they had reached the vicinity of present-day Vermillion, South
              Dakota. Burroughs calculated that at least 227 bison were killed during the
              expedition. The last known wild bison, in what is now North Dakota, was killed in
              1888, a year after the last one in Montana was killed and about three years after
              the last Nebraska survivors were eliminated from the North Platte Valley.</p>

              and her cubs were seen near the mouth of the Little Missouri. In a letter to his
              mother, 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>mentioned seeing

              very common over this entire route. Burroughs calculated that at least 23 black
              bears were killed during the expedition. Black bears are now completely gone from
              Kansas. They are also probably gone from the Missouri Valley of South Dakota (a 1968
              Black Hills sighting is the most recent) and from North Dakota (there are some
              early-twentieth-century records of sightings in the Turtle Mountains). In 2000 a
              black bear wandered into northwestern Nebraska, perhaps from Wyoming, producing the
              first state record since 1907. Since then a few more bears have reported in western
              Nebraska.</p>

              north, and a third near the mouth of the Niobrara River. From that point onward
              through the Dakotas and Montana, many more were killed. Burroughs calculated that at
              least 375 elk were killed during the expedition. On the return trip the last one was
              obtained near the mouth of the Kansas River. Eventually the elk was extirpated from
              Nebraska and both Dakotas. By 1877 it was gone from Nebraska, and from South Dakota
              by 1888. In North Dakota it survived into the 1890s. Captive herds now occur in all
              three states.</p>

              the pronghorn population in Nebraska had been reduced to about 100 animals, and by

              killed during the expedition. Deer were rather uniformly taken on the upstream phase
              from central Missouri to the Montana mountain ranges, and again on the return trip
              across the Great Plains. Usually the specific identity of the deer killed was not
              reported, but the expedition provided the first careful descriptions of both the
              mule deer of the Great Plains and the Pacific-slope black-tailed deer (the two are
              now considered subspecies). The name "mule deer" was first coined by

              Nebraska. A few were also shot on September 6 in what would become southern Burt
              County. A few white pelicans still use this dredged and highly channelized stretch
              of the Missouri River during migration to and from their North Dakota or Manitoba
              breeding grounds, but most migration now occurs in lakes and rivers farther west,

              what is now Dakota County might have been migrating black-bellied plovers or perhaps
              American golden-plovers (
              <hi rend="italic">Pluvialis dominica</hi>). Although both species migrate through
              Nebraska in autumn, the migration dates for the golden-plover are from early
              September to late November, and the black-bellied from August to early November.
              Thus, only the black-bellied would likely have been present in the state during
              mid-August. Other plover or sandpiper species are also possible candidates; Lewis
              and

              Canada geese were later seen in at least 30 locations in Montana. On the return trip
              geese were also observed on September 4 and 5, 1806, between present-day Dixon and

                        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>referred to this
              species as "the Prairie fowl common to the Illinois" and said that its range
              extended as far north as the mouth of the James River, above which the sharp-tailed
              species occurred. The farthest point north at which 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>saw the birds thus may
              have been in present-day Cedar County, Nebraska, or across the river on the South
              Dakota side near present-day Yankton. This interior race of the greater
              prairie-chicken is closely related to the now-extinct Atlantic coast race of
              prairie-chicken, which was called the heath hen (
              <hi rend="italic">T. c. cupido</hi>). The interior race 
              <hi rend="italic">pinnatus</hi>thrived during the late 1800s as the fertile lands of
              the tallgrass prairies were initially opened to small-grain agriculture, but the
              population collapsed only a few decades later as natural breeding habitats became
              increasingly rare. The interior race has long been extirpated from the immediate
              Missouri Valley of Nebraska, but it does still occur as close as Johnson and Pawnee
              Counties near the Kansas-Nebraska border. It also still survives locally in the
              Missouri Valley of southern South Dakota, though it once ranged across essentially
              all of both Dakotas and even barely into eastern Montana.</p>

              from a specimen obtained in the West Indies. As with the piping plover, the middle
              Missouri River has long been a major nesting region for this subspecies, which is
              now nationally endangered. Like the piping plover, the least tern evolved in an
              environment adapted to falling water levels during late spring, rather than today's
              generally increasing water levels of the middle and lower Missouri River in the
              spring, when water is released from upstream dams to facilitate summer barge

              been this species. Since the red-tailed hawk is by far the most common breeding hawk
              of the central Missouri Valley, and is a permanent resident all the way north to
              North Dakota, it was almost certainly seen during the expedition's Great Plains
              phase. Red-tailed hawk populations have increased significantly in North America
              during the last four decades, the birds having benefited from improved federal
              protection and having learned to exploit foraging opportunities along

              of a "black bird" near Spirit Mound in Clay County, South Dakota (opposite Dixon
              County, Nebraska), on August 25, 1804. Swenk tentatively identified this species as
              the lark bunting (
              <hi rend="italic">Calamospiza melanocorys</hi>). However, by August the lark
              bunting's breeding season is over, and males would be molting out of their nearly
              all-black breeding plumage and into a brown plumage. Other more common and
              permanently black-plumaged birds in that region are better possibilities, including
              various blackbirds and grackles. Gary Moulton has suggested that 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>observed the red-winged
              blackbird, which seems a much more likely choice, as by late August these abundant
              birds would be forming migratory flocks. One of the most numerous of North American
              songbirds, this species may number in excess of 100 million birds. However, although
              it probably increased greatly during the first half of the twentieth century, its
              overall population has been declining significantly over the past four decades as
              breeding habitats have been increasingly converted to agriculture.</p>

              greater prairie-chickens or sharp-tailed grouse, given the wooded habitat along the
              river. Early records suggest that ruffed grouse once occurred along Nebraska's

              their fall migration occurs mainly along the Atlantic coast. Whimbrels might also

              September is remarkably late for whip-poor-wills to call, as this species has
              usually finished vocalizing by early August. It has apparently moved gradually
              northward during the past two centuries and now breeds as far north as southern
              South Dakota. However, rangewide whip-poor-will populations have declined

              and one was killed on July 25, 1804, near present-day Council Bluffs. Another was
              killed the next day at the same camp, and others were taken on July 30 in what is
              now Washington County. Others were killed on August 5, 1804, on the Iowa side (now
              Harrison County) and one on August 9 on the Nebraska side (now Burt or Douglas
              County). Another was killed September 4 (now Knox County, Nebraska), and turkeys
              were seen above the mouth of the Niobrara River along the present Nebraska-South
              Dakota border (Boyd or Charles Mix County, respectively) on September 5. Others were
              killed in the same general boundary area on September 5 and 8. On the expedition's
              return trip through Nebraska wild turkeys were seen along the shorelines in

              numbers during the river ascent through Nebraska, from as early as August 15, 1804
              (present-day Dakota County), to September 5, 1804 (present-day Thurston or Burt
              County). As Swenk concluded, these most probably were wood ducks, which would have
              been common along the wooded Missouri River shorelines in late summer. Wood ducks
              were also reportedly seen in the vicinity of Great Falls, Montana, on June 19 and
              23, 1805. Wood duck populations have increased significantly in North America during
              the last four decades, and their breeding range has expanded both to the west and
              north, partly as a result of the widespread erection of nesting boxes.</p>

                     <p>This is a widespread perennial forb whose vernacular name refers to the fact that
              it opens late in the afternoon, blooms all night, and wilts by the following
              morning. Its generic name means marvelous or strange, and its root was used by
              Native Americans for many medicinal purposes. The Lakotas boiled the root to treat
              fever, and it was also used as an apparently effective vermifuge. Among the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Pawnees</name>the dried root was
              ground up and used as a remedy for sore mouth in babies, and a root decoction was

                     <p>A widespread native perennial shrub. The young shoots were used by Native
              Americans as a potherb, the petals were eaten raw, candied, or dried for use as
              perfume. The bark was smoked as a component of tobacco substitutes, and the leaves
              were used for tea or as decoctions to treat eye inflammations. The fruits ("hips")
              of roses are rich in vitamins A and C, as well as tannin, flavonol glycosides, and

               <p>Although the extreme southeastern boundary of South Dakota was reached on August 21,
          1804, the first actual South Dakota campsite was made on August 23, when the group
          camped near the present site of Vermillion, South Dakota. On that same day they killed
          their first bison, near the present site of Ionia, Dixon County. On the 24th they passed
          a "bluff of blue clay," the so-called Burning Bluffs. The surface of this rocky outcrop
          was unaccountably warm to the touch, as if it had been burning from within, a phenomenon
          now believed to have been caused by chemical oxidation. By August 28 the group had
          reached the present site of Yankton, South Dakota, where they remained until August 31,
          holding a council with the local Yankton 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>natives. On September 7 they
          observed a treeless dome on the south side of the river that they named "The Cupola"
          (now known as Old Baldy). At the base of this conical dome they discovered a colony of
          black-tailed prairie dogs, a species then new to science. After the entire group spent
          most of a day fetching and pouring about five barrels of water down one hole, the
          resident rodent was finally evicted and caught. Several others were shot and their skins
          preserved. Some prairie dogs were also eaten during the expedition and were considered
          fine table fare. Two other members of the prairie-dog community that directly depend on
          prairie dogs for their own survival, the burrowing owl (
          <hi rend="italic">Athene cunicularia</hi>) and the black-footed ferret (
          <hi rend="italic">Mustela nigripes</hi>), were not encountered. The ferret was not
          discovered and described scientifically for another half-century, but by 1900 it had
          already been virtually eliminated from North Dakota as well as from most of the Great
          Plains. It was one of the first Great Plains endemic species to be listed under the
          Endangered Species Act. The Great Plains race of the burrowing owl was discovered on the
          plains of western Nebraska in 1820. The rapidly declining burrowing owl may also soon be
          a candidate for similar nationally threatened or endangered listing.</p>

               <p>The expedition left the common boundary of Nebraska and South Dakota on September 8,
          1804. Moving north in South Dakota, large herds of bison were seen, as well as elk and
          deer. They passed the mouth of the White River on September 15, soon encountering
          "multitudes" of prairie dogs and vast herds of bison and antelope. By September 20 they
          had reached the Big Bend of the Missouri River, sending two men by horseback across the
          narrow peninsula to hunt and await their arrival around the enormous bend. Here the
          first female pronghorn was killed, as well as several mule deer. A coyote was also
          killed, and was identified as a small species of prairie wolf. On September 24 they
          reached what they called the "
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>" River (now known as
          the Bad River, its original English name), so named by the group because of the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>(Brule) Lakotas who
          lived along it. Several days were spent interacting with this tribe, including some
          distinctly unfriendly encounters, and it was not until September 28 that they again
          departed upstream. They soon passed several abandoned villages of the Arikaras ("
          <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Rickara</name>s"), and by October 8 met
          the first band of that group near the mouth of the Grand River. By the 13th they were on
          their way again, passing the mouth of Spring Creek (now 
          <name type="person" key="Campbell, John">Campbell</name>County), a short distance below
          the present North Dakota boundary. That night was their last South Dakota campground,
          and on October 14 they camped near 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name>Creek, virtually on
          the present North Dakota-South Dakota boundary.</p>
               <p>They passed the mouth of North Dakota's Cannonball River on October 18, in what is
          the present-day Standing Rock Reservation, and on the 19th counted 53 herds of bison and
          3 elk herds, all in view at a single time. They soon began to encounter abandoned 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages as well as old
          Arikara villages. There were also active Awatixa Hidatsa ("Minnetaree") villages in the
          area, along the Knife River. It was at one of these Hidatsa villages that the teenaged 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>woman 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was living with a French fur trader,
          Touissant Charbonneau. She had been captured and abducted near Three Forks about five
          years earlier by the Hidatsas, and had been won by Charbonneau on a wager. On October 26
          Lewis and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>arrived at an active 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>village site, a location
          they selected for their winter quarters and named Fort 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>. Later known as Fort 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, it was located in what is now the
          southeastern corner of Mercer County. They were approximately 1,600 river miles up the
          Missouri from their starting point and roughly halfway across their transcontinental
          route.</p>
               <p>The expedition spent the winter of 1804-5 at Fort 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>, not departing again until
          April 7, 1805. At that point the Corps of Discovery consisted of 32 persons. Besides
          their basic exploratory party of 28 men, they had added 2 interpreters, including
          Touissant Charbonneau as well as 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>and her infant son, Baptiste, born
          only about two months previously. The keelboat and its crew of eleven men were sent back
          to St. Louis, along with many specimens and artifacts that were destined for Washington
          DC. Among them were live prairie dogs and magpies, 60 preserved plant specimens, a
          variety of Native American materials, and various skins and skeletons.</p>
               <p>The Corps then headed upstream, passing the mouth of the Little Missouri River on
          April 12 and reaching the mouth of the Yellowstone River on April 26, where they were
          only a few miles from the present-day boundary of Montana. Between this point and the
          present boundary, Fort Union was built in 1830 and operated as a frontier trading post
          for some time before being abandoned. They entered what is now eastern Montana on April
          27, 1805, camping just a few miles upstream.</p>
               <p>The return trip was much more rapid and far less rewarding in terms of biological
          discovery. Little time was wasted during this phase, especially after 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>'s narrow escape from
          eight 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name>men during his
          independent exploration of the upper Marias River of western Montana, together with
          three of his men. After that hazardous encounter the four men quickly returned to the
          Missouri River. There they rejoined the rest of their party and continued downstream,
          reaching the mouth of the Yellowstone River and the approximate boundary of present-day
          North Dakota on August 7.</p>
               <p>This confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers (approximately at the current
          Montana-North Dakota border) was the agreed-upon rendezvous point for rejoining 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>and his men after their
          separate route down the Yellowstone River. However, by the time Lewis and his party
          finally arrived at the planned meeting point, 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s group had already departed
          downstream and had left an explanatory note. Lewis and his men thus moved quickly
          downstream to catch up. Lewis's party finally caught up with that of 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>about 150 miles below the
          mouth of the Yellowstone River on August 12, 1806, at a location now flooded by Lake
          Sakakawea but that was probably near Crow Flies High Butte.</p>
               <p>The combined Corps then descended the Missouri River in what is now North Dakota.
          They passed the mouth of the Little Missouri River on August 13, and reached Fort 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>by the 17th. On August 22
          they passed the mouth of the Grand River, and thus were about 25 miles into present-day
          South Dakota, and on August 25th they passed the mouth of the Cheyenne River. By
          September 1 they had passed the mouth of the Niobrara River, and had the present-day

              Thereafter, bison were present in uncountable numbers on the Dakota plains. On
              September 17, 1804, near the mouth of the White River, a group of about 3,000were in
              view at a single time. Between the vicinity of Bon Homme Island, South Dakota, and

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>but not formally named as a new
              species until 1815. As noted earlier, it was discovered somewhat upstream of the
              mouth of the Niobrara River on September 7, 1804, at a clay promontory the explorers
              described as "The Tower," located in what is now northern Boyd County. The animals
              were called "barking squirrels" by 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>, and prairie dogs
              (a rough translation of the French

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>is shorter but very
              interesting. The explorers also saw prairie-dog towns in South Dakota near the White
              River. These rodents were not specifically mentioned while the expedition was in
              North Dakota, although the animals are known from later records to have been
              abundant along the Missouri River, and the four prairie dogs sent back to Washington
              DC in the spring of l805 from Fort 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>probably had been
              captured locally. One of them survived the 4,000-mile journey and was exhibited for
              a time at Charles W. Peale's Philadelphia Museum, then located in Independence Hall.
              Prairie dogs were again observed in Montana, including a colony about seven miles in
              length that was seen in the vicinity of the mouth of the Marias River. At that
              location a few were killed and eaten, and were found to be "well flavoured and
              tender." They were also seen near the mouth of the Musselshell River. On the return
              trip prairie dogs were seen as far south as the vicinity of the Niobrara River,
              along the South Dakota-Nebraska border, and apparently close to where they had first
              been discovered.</p>

            <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had earlier (August 12, 1804)
            observed a kind of smaller wolf that "barks like a large ferce dog." It wasn't until
            the expedition was on the Missouri River the next spring (May 5, 1805) that 
            <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>found a den of young "wolves,"
            and

            being a "small wolf or burrowing dog of the prairies." Lewis noted their doglike

            Although the coyote was thus first well described by Lewis and

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, but it was not formally named
              until 1823. The gray wolf was apparently first encountered on July 20, 1804, near
              the mouth of Weeping Water Creek in southeastern Nebraska, when a "large yellow
              wolf" was killed. On September 21, near the Big Bend of the Missouri in South
              Dakota, a "white" wolf was shot and skinned. Both wolves and coyotes were seen
              during the expedition between southeastern Nebraska and the Pacific Coast; both were
              called "wolves" and often were not distinguished. However, the larger form was
              sometimes called the "white wolf" and at other times the "large brown wolf." Near

              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>described the wolf
              well, pointing out that it differed from the smaller coyote in not taking refuge in
              the ground or in a burrow. He also noted that the colors of true wolves varied from
              blackish brown or gray to creamy white. Wolves were eliminated from Nebraska by
              1920, from North Dakota probably during the 1920s, and from South Dakota by 1934,
              when the last one was killed in the Black Hills. Vagrants have been reported at

              "White Bear Clift" was named as the site where a grizzly bear had once been killed.
              Bear tracks were seen on October 7, 1804, on Fox Island, near the mouth of the
              Moreau River in South Dakota. However, the first actual encounter with a grizzly was
              on October 20, 1804,when one was wounded near the mouth of the Heart River, just
              south of present-day Bismarck, North Dakota. Bear tracks of great size were also
              encountered at the mouth of the Little Missouri River on April 13, 1805. Finally, a
              grizzly bear was killed by 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>on April 29 at the
              mouth of the Yellowstone River, near the Montana border. An even larger male was

              Audubon visited the Fort Union area 30 and 39 years later, respectively, grizzly
              bears were still common there. However, grizzly bears were extirpated from South
              Dakota by about 1890 and from North Dakota by about the end of the nineteenth
              century. Two were killed near Oakdale, North Dakota, in the autumn of 1897, perhaps
              representing the last known from that state, or indeed from anywhere within the
              Great Plains east of Montana.</p>

              seen by one of the crew members. The first specimen of this species was shot near

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>immediately recognized

              North Dakota. In 1833 Maximilian reported that 200 to 300 otter skins were brought
              in annually to Fort Union, and the skins were often used by Native Americans as
              decorations. By the early 1900s otters had been eliminated from all Nebraska rivers

              were seen near present-day Poplar, Montana, on May 5, 1805, where a small river was
              named Porcupine River (now the Poplar River) because of the abundance of porcupines
              there.</p>

                     <p>The first pronghorn killed during the expedition was obtained near the mouth of
              the White River in South Dakota on September 14, 1804. This was a male, or "Buck
              Goat," in 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>'s words. He described
              it fairly well, concluding it to be "more like the Antilope or Gazella of Africa"
              than like any species of goat. The first female was killed six days later in the Big
              Bend region of South Dakota. 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>noted the female's smaller size
              and smaller horns, and that neither sex has a beard. He thought the animals to be
              "keenly made" and "butifull." Pronghorns were eventually almost extirpated from
              Nebraska by the early 1900s but have recently become locally reestablished as a
              result of release programs. They were also barely surviving in the Dakotas by the
              turn of the twentieth century but have recovered well in those two states.</p>

              later, Audubon also found them to be common at both Fort

              he also kept it as a pet, eventually taking it back to his home in New York State.
              Swift fox skins were worn by men of the Kit Fox Society of the Oglala 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>, and their fur was
              additionally used to wrap war lances. Similarly, wolf skins were worn ceremonially
              by men of the Wolf Society and were also used as camouflage when stalking bison. The

              Society, and according to Joseph Brown one of their songs was as follows: "I am a

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>but was not formally described
              and scientifically named until 1839. Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>properly referred to
              jackrabbits as "hares" rather than rabbits. After collecting the first specimen near
              the mouth of the White River on September 14, 1804, 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>provided measurements
              and commented on its white tail. His description thus clearly separates it from the
              black-tailed jackrabbit (
              <hi rend="italic">L. californicus</hi>) of the same general region, although it now
              generally occurs farther south. Other sightings of jackrabbits in South Dakota
              occurred on September 17, 20, and 24, 1804. One was killed at Fort 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>in January of 1805, and
              another was obtained in North Dakota the following spring, not far north of Fort 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>. Jackrabbits were also
              seen at several Montana sites. One that was shot on May 26, 1805, weighed 8.5
              pounds, which is fairly large even for a white-tailed jackrabbit, and is
              substantially larger than the black-tailed jackrabbit. White-tailed jackrabbits
              remained common in North Dakota well into the 1900s; during one organized hunt near
              the town of New England in December of 1924, 7,550 of the animals were killed. This
              writer remembers community hunts being organized in the Red River Valley of North
              Dakota into the mid-1930s, during the depression and drought years. White-tailed
              jackrabbits are now quite rare in the Dakotas and Nebraska.</p>

              cottonwood trees between Fort 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and the Little Missouri

              the nests, and the birds were again seen on August 9 at the mouth of Prairie Creek,
              near Grayling, Montana. Long on the federally endangered list, the bald eagle has
              recovered significantly in the past few decades as a result of intensive management

              from Europe, but the American magpie represented a new subspecies. Magpies were also

              of the Missouri River, where the magpie was first encountered (Reid and Gannon
              1999). This same sort of ecological and geographic replacement of the blue jay by
              the magpie is evident today on the western high plains. Like magpies, blue jay
              populations have declined significantly in North America during the last four
              decades, perhaps in part because of competition with the larger American crows.</p>

              American bird species by ornithologists for another 145 years. Lewis also astutely
              observed that under the freezing conditions (30 degrees F) the bird could scarcely
              move, and that even after its heart and lungs were pierced with a knife it remained
              alive for nearly two hours! Like his later substantiated report of finding Canada
              geese nesting in trees (probably using old nests of osprey or eagle), this
              observation was probably not believed by scientists of the time.</p>

              manner. Common raven populations have increased significantly in North America
              during the last four decades.</p>

              pigeon, with the top of their heads black." This description might fit the
              Franklin's gull better than the Forster's tern, since the gull is more likely to
              migrate in large flocks, and in the summer plumage of the Franklin's gull the entire
              upper and rear parts of the head are black or dark gray.</p>

              River, and again on May 5, near Prairie Elk Creek. The ones he described were of the
              usual white-plumaged morph type; the "gray brant" he described as also present in
              the flocks might have been young of the previous year or perhaps adults or young of
              the so-called "blue goose" genetic variant, which are mostly dark grayish brown. He
              also described a "common brown brant" two-thirds the size of the "common goose"

              the vicinity of Wolf Point (May 5, 1805). Snow goose populations have increased very
              significantly in North America during the last four decades, largely because they
              have adjusted their migrations to exploit the protection afforded by wildlife
              refuges, and are now perhaps more abundant than at any time in American history.</p>

                     <p>This widespread perennial forb belongs to a genus often used as medicines by many
              Native American tribes of the Great Plains. The edible roots were sometimes eaten
              but were more often used as treatments for a wide array of ailments. Thus, the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Pawnees</name>boiled the enlarged
              root and ate it to treat diarrhea, and the ground flower heads were mixed with corn
              and fed to horses to increase their endurance. The physiologic basis for these
              varied medicinal applications is not known, but the traditional use of the root for
              treating snakebite is the basis for the vernacular English name snakeroot. Collected
              September 12, 1804, in present-day Brule County, South Dakota.</p>

              rheumatism, and its dried stems were used as brooms. All sage species probably
              contain artemisin and santonin, both lactone glycosides that have vermifuge
              properties, thus the name "wormwood" has been applied to some species. A terpenelike
              essential oil, thujone, is also present and may help account for the medicinal
              effects of sages. Collected September 15, 1804, in present-day Lyman or Brule

              Kindscher as "the most important wild food of the Plains Indians." Its root was used
              by the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name>for making
              medicinal tea or directly chewed for various ailments. A specimen was collected

               <p>On April 27, 1805, the expedition left the mouth of the Yellowstone River and
          probably passed the boundary of present-day Montana that same day. The courses of the
          Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers have changed greatly in the past two centuries, leaving
          room for some doubt as to the exact day the party reached what is now the eastern border
          of Montana. They very soon encountered large numbers of deer, elk, bison, wolves, and
          grizzly bears. They reached "Martha's River" (now the Big Muddy River) on April 29 and
          the "Porcupine River" (now the Poplar River) on May 3. The Milk River was reached on May
          8 and the Musselshell on May 20. "Judith's River" (now the Judith River) was passed on
          May 29 and the mouth of "Maria's River" (now simply spelled the Marias River) on June 2,
          1805.</p>
               <p>A major geographic discovery, the Great Falls of the Missouri River, was reached on
          June 16, 1805. At that point a major portage was needed, and it was not until July 15
          that the party was able to get under way again. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>and his small advance party
          reached the Three Forks region on July 25,where the 
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, Madison, and 
          <name type="person" key="Gallatin, Albert">Gallatin</name>Rivers (all named by Lewis and
          
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>) merge to form the Missouri. It
          was also near here that 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>had been captured five years
          previously. At Three Forks the expedition had reached an elevation of slightly more than
          4,000 feet and was at the very western edge of the Great Plains. The rest of the group
          arrived the 17th, and after three more days of local exploration they set off again.
          Following the westernmost branch (
          <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>River) upstream, the
          expedition soon was in the heart of the Rocky Mountains and about to cross the
          Continental Divide.</p>
               <p>The route of the return trip across Montana is complicated by the fact that the
          expedition split into several parties after crossing the Rocky Mountains at Lolo Pass,
          west of present-day Missoula. From Travelers' Rest camp (about 20 miles south of
          Missoula) 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>and a group of 20 men, plus
          
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>and her son, began traveling
          southward on July 3, progressively making their way past the sites of present-day
          Hamilton and Jackson. On July 8 they reached the Beaverhead River somewhat above the
          location of present-day Dillon, where they found their cache of supplies as well as
          their canoes. From there they moved downstream to Three Forks, arriving July 13, 1806.
          Ten members of Captain 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s group were then sent via canoes
          from Three Forks to Great Falls, to begin the arduous portage around the falls and
          rapids.</p>

          and their horses moved overland across Bozeman Pass and reached the upper Yellowstone
          ("Rochejhone") River near the present site of Livingston on July 15, 1806. There the
          trees were not large enough to make canoes, so they continued downstream. At the
          approximate site of present-day Columbus the group stopped long enough to manufacture
          two dugout canoes from cottonwoods and then resumed water travel on July 24. They
          gradually made their way down the Yellowstone, making a short stop on July 25 at a
          sandstone promontory that 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>named "

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>inscribed his own name and the
          date. In that general vicinity they saw a large herd of bighorns as well as flocks of
          geese and pigeons. They arrived at the mouth of the Yellowstone on August 3, 1806, thus
          finally leaving present-day eastern Montana and again passing into what is now western
          North Dakota.</p>
               <p>From Travelers' Rest camp, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and his group of nine
          men (and five guides) independently set forth in a northeasterly direction on July 3,
          1806, for Great Falls, arriving at the river after a hard march of eight days. He left
          six of his party at Great Falls to assist 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s ten-man contingent with the
          downstream portaging, and with his remaining three handpicked men headed on July 16 for
          a brief reconnaissance of the Marias ("Maria's") River. On their way north, they
          sequentially crossed the Sun River ("Medicine River") and the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>River. After reaching
          the Marias, Lewis doggedly followed it northwest to a point about 20 miles west of
          present-day Cut Bank, along a northern tributary, Cut Bank Creek. He was searching for
          the northernmost limits of the Missouri's drainage, and thus the possible northernmost
          legal limits of the Louisiana Purchase. By July 22 he was within sight of the Rocky
          Mountains, but the river had still not turned north, and several days of bad weather had
          made it impossible for him to establish his exact location. After turning back south and
          crossing Two Medicine River (the south fork of Maria's River in Lewis's terminology),
          the exploration ended abruptly on July 27 when eight Piegan 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name>men, with whom they
          had held a peaceful council the day before, tried to steal the group's guns and horses.
          In the resulting fight one 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name>man was killed and
          another was evidently fatally wounded. Lewis himself was very narrowly missed by a
          musket ball. Lewis and his men quickly retreated and again reached the Missouri River
          near the present site of Virgelle on July 28. The site of this harrowing encounter is on
          private land about 15 miles northeast of present-day Valier.</p>
               <p>The group of six men who had been left by 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>to negotiate the Great
          Falls portage was soon met by the ten others who had been sent downstream by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>from Three Forks to help
          with the portaging. After negotiating the Great Falls portage, the 16 men continued
          downstream. By the greatest of good luck, they encountered Lewis and his three-man party
          just as they were returning to the mouth of the Marias River on July 28. The reunited
          group of 20 men then descended the Missouri under the leadership of Captain Lewis,
          reaching the mouth of the Yellowstone River and arriving at the approximate present-day
          boundary of North Dakota on August 7, 1806, only four days behind 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>'s group that had come via
          the Yellowstone. Thus the last members of the Corps of Discovery departed from what is
          now Montana.</p>

                     <p>In Montana, bighorns were reported from at least 15 locations, and at least 35
              were killed during the entire expedition. As noted previously, bighorn sheep were
              first observed at the mouth of the Yellowstone River in extreme western North Dakota
              and were subsequently seen as far west as the Beaverhead Mountains in Montana. In
              one location below the mouth of the Marias River the party killed nine sheep in a
              single day. None was seen along the upper Marias River by 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>. The bighorn was
              formally described and named in 1804. The species still ranges widely in the
              American and Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the poorly characterized race 
              <hi rend="italic">O. c. auduboni</hi>historically inhabited the upper Great Plains
              from Nebraska to North Dakota at the time of the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition. It was first
              distinguished subspecifically from the more widespread Rocky Mountain form in 1901.
              The last state record for native bighorns in North Dakota was in 1905, for South
              Dakota in about 1915, and for Nebraska in 1918. Reintroduced bighorns of the nearly
              identical Rocky Mountain race now occur in Nebraska's Pine Ridge and Wildcat Hills,
              in South Dakota's Black Hills and Badlands National Park, and in North Dakota's
              Theodore Roosevelt National Park.</p>

                     </label>
                     <p>Bison were reported in present-day Montana from at least 33 locations, from the
              North Dakota boundary west up the Missouri Valley almost to Great Falls, along the
              Sun and Marias Rivers, and along the Yellowstone Valley from about present-day
              Billings to the North Dakota boundary. After the great bison slaughter of the middle
              and late nineteenth century, when more than 40 million animals were destroyed, the
              only remaining bison south of Canada were a few hundred individuals that were
              protected in Yellowstone National Park. From these and from some small captive herds
              the present population of several hundred thousand bison has been produced.</p>

                     <p>The bushy-tailed woodrat was first accurately described by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, but the species was not
              formally named until 1815. They encountered it in the vicinity of Great Falls on
              July 2, 1805, and captured a live specimen. Captain Lewis described it with care,
              noting that he had often seen the animals' dens in cliff and tree hollows, and that
              they often eat the fruits and seeds of the prickly pear (
              <hi rend="italic">Opuntia sp</hi>.). Woodrats, more generally known as "packrats,"
              accumulate caches of food items such as cactus fruits, acorns, pine cones, bones,
              and even inedible objects such as small plastic items and other miscellaneous
              "treasures" that they happen to find in the vicinities of their nests. It is now
              known that bushy-tailed woodrats extend east into the western Dakotas, and a few
              decades after Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s expedition Prince Maximilian

                     <p>Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>made many observations of the
              Columbian ground squirrel on the western slope of the Rockies, but only a few apply
              to the extreme western Great Plains. In July of 1806 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>encountered this species in the
              upper Bitterroot Valley, and during Lewis's independent survey of the Marias River
              region during the same month he encountered these animals east of present-day
              Missoula and on the Cut Bank branch of the Marias River. The Columbian ground
              squirrel was first described by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on the basis of specimens they
              obtained in Oregon, but it was not given a formal Latin name until 1815. This
              species is primarily associated geographically with the Columbia River Basin much
              farther to the west.</p>

              River in Montana, but they were evidently much less common than gray wolves there
              and were only rarely mentioned. They became much more common everywhere after the
              disappearance of gray wolves from the Great Plains, and have gradually extended
              their range eastward to the Atlantic coast. In spite of massive poisoning and other
              control efforts, the coyote has thrived better than any other native American dog or
              cat.</p>

                     <p>In Montana, elk were reported from at least 37 locations, from around the

              headwaters, in the mountains to the Bitterroot Valley, and along the entire
              Yellowstone Valley. They were also seen along the Sun River and in the Marias River
              valley near present-day Shelby. They were especially numerous along the Yellowstone
              River, where herds of up to 200 were apparently common. They are still locally
              common in Montana but are mainly confined to forested areas and sanctuaries. Elk
              were eliminated from Nebraska and North Dakota by the early 1880s and from South
              Dakota by 1888. Restoration efforts have occurred in all three states, and small,
              mostly confined herds exist in them.</p>

              of the wolves seen around a bison carcass "were of the large kind." Gray wolves were
              eventually extirpated from Montana, but recent releases in the Yellowstone Park area
              have restored them to the state's faunal list. They have since been seen as far
              south and east as Wyoming's Wind River Range.</p>

                     </label>
                     <p>During the 1805 ascent up the Missouri grizzlies were seen by expedition members
              at no fewer than 17 locations, and Lewis also mentioned them at three locations
              during his survey of the Marias River valley. 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>likewise saw them at least
              twice as he traveled down the Yellowstone Valley. Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>referred to grizzly bears under
              various names, including the "white bear," "brown bear," and "grizly bear." 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>eventually concluded
              that all these color variants were "of the same species only differing in color from
              age or more properly from the same natural cause than many other anamals of the same
              family differ in coulur." The grizzly bear was not formally described and named as a
              distinct species ("
              <hi rend="italic">Ursus ferox</hi>") until 1815, based on the descriptions and
              specimens of Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Raymond Burroughs calculated
              that at least 43 grizzly bears were killed over the entire expedition period, most
              of them in Montana. Twenty three were killed between the mouth of the Yellowstone
              and Three Forks, Montana. Ten were killed in the vicinity of Great Falls alone, and
              14 were killed during the separate return trips of Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>down the Yellowstone and
              Missouri Rivers of Montana. Every shooting of a grizzly was a highly risky
              undertaking. One enormous 600-pound male required ten shots to bring it down. On May
              14 six men set out to kill a grizzly bear. Although all six lead balls hit the bear,
              it attacked, and only after two more bullets struck it, one in the head, did it
              finally collapse, just before reaching its closest human target. Montana now has one
              of the very few remaining populations of grizzly bears south of Canada, with perhaps
              500 to 1,000 surviving in the northern Rockies of the United States and Canada,
              centering on the Glacier-Banff-Jasper ecosystem. There are a few left in the
              Yellowstone Park ecosystem, and they range east and south locally to Wyoming's Wind
              River Range.</p>

                     <p>A few encounters with mountain lions occurred while the expedition was still on
              the Great Plains. On May 16, between the Milk and Musselshell Rivers, a mountain
              lion ("panther") was shot and wounded, but it escaped. One was killed on the 
              <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>River on August 3, 1805,
              and a few days later three deerskins disappeared from camp and were judged to have
              been stolen by a mountain lion. In spite of continuous persecution ever since,
              mountain lions have somehow survived in the Rocky Mountains and Black Hills regions.
              Occasionally stray animals still wander east into Nebraska and eastern South Dakota
              and North Dakota, usually with fatal results to the cats. Their prime prey, mule
              deer and white-tailed deer, have vastly increased in the absence of large predators
              such as wolves and mountain lions, but the increased human population has had little
              tolerance for mountain lions, and most that stray into the Great Plains are quickly
              killed.</p>

              about Wolf Point, and mule deer from that point west up the Missouri Valley to the
              Rocky Mountains. In recent years white-tailed deer have been increasing relative to

              and scientifically named until 1823. It was first encountered on July 6, 1805, in
              the vicinity of Great Falls. At that time Captain Lewis referred to the animal as a
              "remarkable small fox." Two days later one was shot, and it was carefully described
              by Lewis. He noted its remarkably long claws, and later (July 26) mentioned the
              black tip of its tail, another distinguishing features of the species. This high
              plains species is now barely surviving in Nebraska, the Dakotas, and eastern
              Montana, with very few recent records for any of these states. There are only two
              North Dakota records since 1976 (Mercer and Golden Valley Counties), and four
              southwestern South Dakota counties have recent records. There may also be some swift
              foxes left in the nearby Oglala National Grassland of northwestern Nebraska and in
              Nebraska's Box Butte County, where some were photographed in 2001. Perhaps some also
              survive in the extreme southwestern counties of Nebraska near the Pawnee National
              Grassland of adjacent Colorado, where they are known to occur. Swift foxes are
              easily trapped, and in most areas have lost prairie dogs as part of their food
              base.</p>

              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>obtained a live
              specimen and carefully described it. The thirteen-lined ground squirrel was not
              formally described and named until 1821. It is still one of the most commonly seen
              and widespread rodents of the northern plains, and is a major food for coyotes,
              badgers, and other grassland predators. Like other ground squirrels, it is dormant
              for more than half of the year, which may reduce predation levels.</p>

              uniquely recurved bills are mainly used for extracting small invertebrates from the

              relatively clear rivers supporting small fishes. Belted kingfisher populations have
              declined significantly in North America during the last four decades, probably as a

              In the expedition's Meteorological Register of May 17, 1805, it was noted that
              "large and small blackbirds" had returned to eastern Montana. 
              <name type="person" key="Coues, Elliott">Elliott Coues</name>identified these as
              most probably brown-headed cowbirds and Brewer's blackbirds. Probable cowbirds were

              (referred to by the explorers as the "buffalo-pecker") must have regularly
              associated with bison before domestic cattle appeared on the Great Plains. Cowbird
              populations are now declining nationally, but they still pose a serious threat to
              native songbirds because of their parasitic nesting behavior. Brewer's blackbird
              populations have also declined significantly rangewide.</p>

              Nighthawks, whip-poor-wills, and poorwills are aerial insect-eaters; their extremely

              not enough information was offered to distinguish which kingbird species was seen.
              In the expedition's Meteorological Register of May 25, 1805, it was noted that the
              "king-bird or bee-martin" had returned seasonally to the vicinity of the mouth of
              the Musselshell River. Kingbirds are rather late spring arrivals in the northern
              United States, as they winter in tropical America. The eastern species is more
              likely to have been seen than the western, since the eastern would have been the one
              familiar to the explorers and would not have attracted special attention. Also, it
              is more often found closer to water than the more arid-adapted western species.
              Kingbirds of undetermined species were also noted on June 10, 1805, near the mouth
              of the Marias River, and on August 2, 1806, near present-day Missoula. The eastern
              kingbird's rangewide population has declined significantly during the past four
              decades.</p>

                     <p>One of the species definitely discovered by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>is this large sage-adapted
              grouse. It was first seen on June 5, 1805, near the Marias River in Montana, when an
              attempt to kill one was unsuccessful. Others were seen at Lemhi Pass in the
              Beaverhead Mountains on August 12 of that year, but it was not until October 17 that
              several were actually shot. Both Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>provided detailed descriptions
              of the species, 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>calling it the "prarie cock"
              and Lewis the "cock of the plains." Lewis also first described the species' unusual
              saclike gizzard, describing it as more like a "maw" (crop) than a typical muscular
              grinding organ. He said this grouse feeds almost entirely on the "pulpy leafed
              thorn," presumably confusing the relatively inedible black greasewood with the
              bird's actual primary (almost sole) food, the highly nutritious leaves of big
              sagebrush (
              <hi rend="italic">Artemisia tridentata</hi>). John J. Audubon used Lewis's'
              suggested name "cock of the plains" when he painted the species about three decades
              later. Greater sage-grouse populations have plummeted in recent decades, as the
              West's once-vast areas of native sagebrush have been progressively cleared.</p>

                     <p>One of the major ornithological discoveries of the expedition was Captain Lewis's
              discovery of the woodpecker that now bears his name. On July 20, 1805, along Prickly
              Pear Creek and near present-day Helena, Montana, Lewis first saw a "black woodpecker
              (or crow)." He judged it to be about the size of a flicker but as black as a crow.
              He was not able to obtain a specimen until May of 1806, when in Idaho the expedition
              members "killed and preserved several." He then provided a highly detailed
              description of the bird, and at least one of the preserved specimens made its way
              back east, where it eventually ended up in the hands of Charles W. Peale, curator of
              the Philadelphia Museum housed in Independence Hall. The specimen that Alexander
              Wilson used to illustrate the species for the first time was one of those collected
              by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and it was named "Lewis's
              woodpecker." Wilson's original sketches of this woodpecker and of 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s nutcracker (
              <hi rend="italic">Nucifraga columbiana</hi>), similarly named after Captain 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, are still present in the
              Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Like the red-headed woodpecker, the
              Lewis's woodpecker is distinctly migratory and often occurs well away from dense
              woods. Its population numbers have not changed significantly in the past four
              decades.</p>

              be new to science. However, it later was recognized as an undescribed subspecies of
              an already known species. Lewis noted the shrike's hawklike claws and judged it to
              be a predator of insects. It is now known to prey also on a wide variety of animals,
              including both small mammals and birds. It is characteristic of open, often arid,
              country. Loggerhead shrike populations have declined significantly in North America

              seen in northern Montana near the mouth of the Judith River. It was also seen July
              16, 1806, near Great Falls and near present-day Fort Peck on August 3, 1806. Unlike
              some similar-sized woodpeckers such as the downy and hairy, this is a seasonally
              migratory species, at least in the northern states. Its rangewide population has
              declined significantly in the past four decades.</p>

                     <p>The first mention of sandhill cranes by Lewis came on July 15, 1805, in the
              vicinity of the Gates of the Rocky Mountains, Montana, where several examples of the
              "large brown or Sandhill crain" were seen leading young. A living young bird was
              also brought into camp on July 19, 1805, near Three Forks, Montana. Lewis eventually
              released it. Greater sandhill cranes (
              <hi rend="italic">Grus canadensis tabida</hi>) continue to survive in the northern
              Rocky Mountain region and have been increasing both regionally and nationally in

                     <p>On July 22, 1805, 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>reported seeing "a
              species of small curlooe of a brown color" at present-day Canyon Ferry, Montana.
              This bird was tentatively identified by Rueben Thwaites as a mountain plover, but 
              <name type="person" key="Coues, Elliott">Elliott Coues</name>instead believed that
              it might have been an upland sandpiper. Either species would be geographically
              possible, but the sandpiper, which is somewhat more curlewlike than the plover and
              is more widespread, would seem the more likely possibility. Descriptive terms such
              as curlew (spelled variously) and plover were evidently used rather indiscriminately
              for shorebirds by expedition members, with curlew perhaps usually applied to the
              longer-billed or larger species. Too little information is available to make an
              informed guess as to the identity of this particular bird. The mountain plover's
              population has declined to the point that it is now a federally endangered species,
              whereas the population of the upland sandpiper has increased slightly during the
              past four decades, one of the very few grassland-adapted bird species that has shown
              this trend.</p>

              with some care and detail, incorrectly thinking it might be new to science, and he

              described the bird's wings as white, tipped with black, making identification of
              this distinctive species fairly certain. Like avocets, willets are still fairly

                     <p>Many encounters with rattlesnakes were reported by the expedition; one of the
              earliest that certainly involved the prairie rattlesnake occurred May 17, 1805, near
              the mouth of the Yellowstone River. Rattlesnakes were also encountered in Missouri,
              Nebraska (in present-day Washington and Boyd Counties), and South Dakota (near the
              White River). Of these, the Missouri and southern Nebraska locations may possibly
              have involved the relatively large and more dangerous timber rattlesnakes (

              rattlesnakes at least a dozen times on the plains of Montana, including several near
              escapes from being bitten. The western rattlesnake was not formally described and
              given a Latin name until 1818.</p>

              a somewhat frightening, cobralike defensive display. Its distinctive upturned snout
              is used for digging in sand, where it searches for toads and other prey.</p>

                     <p>Catfish, most probably including both the channel and blue catfish, were caught

              channel catfish ranges upstream to Montana, and the blue catfish to the Dakotas.
              "White catfish" were caught in numbers, and one of the party's major Nebraska
              campsites (July 22-26, 1804, near present-day Lake Manawa) was named "White Catfish
              camp" because of the several large catfish caught there. Channel catfish and blue
              catfish both occur in this region and both closely resemble the white catfish (
              <hi rend="italic">Ictalurus catus</hi>) of eastern North America. However, the blue
              catfish is on average considerably larger than the channel catfish, the largest
              known examples exceeding 100 pounds, whereas channel catfish rarely reach 30 pounds.
              Nine catfish caught near the mouth of the Vermillion River on August 25, 1804,
              collectively weighed nearly 300 pounds, which would strongly suggest that they were

              manufacturing dugout canoes. Ten of the 15 dugout canoes the expedition members

              The Lakotas similarly made a paste to rub over their hands and arms, thus seemingly
              making them immune to the effects of scalding water. The "contrary medicine men" of
              the Lakotas used this purported protective trait to impress onlookers and encourage
              faith in their apparent special powers. Collected July 20, 1806, probably in
              present-day Toole County, Montana. A newly discovered species.</p>

                     <p>This is a widespread perennial forb on dry grasslands. Its leaves are somewhat
              poisonous, but they were used by the Dakotas as a basis for medicinal tea, which was
              used to treat mothers producing insufficient milk, and its crushed leaves were also
              used in warm water to make a kind of liniment. However, exposure of the skin to the
              milky sap can also cause severe inflammation. Collected July 28, 1806, along the
              Yellowstone River and in what is now Rosebud County, Montana. A newly discovered
              species.</p>

              of Council Bluffs off Brohard Avenue. Council Bluffs is also home to the Western

              1804. Fort Atkinson was founded in 1820 but was soon abandoned in 1827, when western
              overland routes farther south made the Missouri River corridor less vital to
              national interests. Fort restoration began in the 1960s, and there are now several
              restored buildings as well as a visitor center. The fort is located on the summit of
              Council Bluff (on the Nebraska side of the river, not in Iowa), the place where
              Lewis and

              the bluff summit, and because of timber growth is no longer visible from the bluff.)
              This was Lewis and

              assigned a reservation area of 160,000 acres along the present-day Nebraska-Kansas

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>on August 11, 1804. Chief
              Blackbird had died of smallpox in 1800 and was buried sitting erect on a horse, and
              a wooden pole decorated with all of the scalps he had taken was planted in the soil
              above. His gravesite is situated on the highest of the river bluffs between Decatur

                     <p>The

              region from the Ohio River valley by the 1700s, and by 1775 the tribe had a large
              village in this immediate area. During the smallpox epidemic of 1800 the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>population was reduced
              from about 700 to 300, and its previous reputation as a powerful warrior society
              disappeared. During the later period of displacement of Native Americans to
              reservations in the mid-1800s, the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>s were allowed to remain
              on part (originally 300,000 acres) of their original homeland. The northern part of
              their ceded land was later given to the Winnebagos, and some of the remainder was
              later sold to white settlers. In spite of their peaceful nature the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>s were not accepted as
              U.S. citizens until 1887, and their full rights of citizenship were not attained
              until 1924. Similarly, the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Pawnees</name>of eastern Nebraska
              (the "Pani" or "Pania" of Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>) were sent in the 1850s to a
              relatively tiny preserve of about 300 square miles along the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Loup or Skiri Pawnees">Loup</name>River (now part of
              Nance County), an area representing less than 1 percent of their original vast
              homeland along the Platte Valley. After this land was sold to settlers in 1872 they
              were relocated in 1874 to a part of Indian Territory (Oklahoma), in an area between
              the Arkansas and Cimarron Rivers. At the time of Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Pawnees</name>were probably second
              only to the Lakotas in population size among Plains natives, numbering perhaps
              10,000 people. By comparison, the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>s may have historically

              later with about 30 of his followers to bury his eldest son in an ancestral
              graveyard led to the entire group's arrest. It produced one of the most famous
              courtroom scenes in American history and raised the remarkable legal question as to
              whether a Native American was a "person" under the meaning of then-existing law. The
              case against Standing Bear was eventually dismissed by the Supreme Court, and a
              restoration of 26,236 acres of 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Ponca Indians">Ponca</name>tribal land in the
              Niobrara Valley occurred in 1881, after a presidential commission reviewed the
              tribe's sad history. In 1884 the Oklahoma (or " Hot Country") 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Ponca Indians">Poncas</name>were moved to a new
              reservation in the Salt Fork River area. This group is now located in Kay and Noble
              Counties of Oklahoma. However, the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Ponca Indians">Ponca</name>reservation in Nebraska
              was dissolved in 1954, and for several decades the tribe was no longer recognized by
              the federal government, until it was officially restored again in 1990.</p>

                     <p>This treeless sedimentary cone of grayish-yellow clays, about 70 feet in height,
              was discovered and named "The Cupola" by expedition members on September 7, 1804.
              Now known as "Old Baldy," this largely intact site is seven miles north of Lynch,
              Nebraska, on privately owned land. The nearest public road (unnumbered but easily
              traveled) passes within about a half mile and offers an excellent view of the site
              and several miles of the nearby river valley, which is still fairly pristine. At the
              base of this promontory a colony of blacktailed prairie dogs was discovered by Lewis
              and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, the first examples of this
              keystone shortgrass plains species known to science. This colony is now gone, but
              others occur in the general vicinity. Several prairie dogs that Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>had captured alive were sent
              back to Washington DC in April of 1805, one of which survived the 4,000-mile trip.
              It and a black-billed magpie that had likewise survived were eventually displayed
              alive for a time at Charles W. Peale's Philadelphia Museum (also known as Peale's
              Museum), which eventually received nearly all the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>specimens at the end of the
              expedition. It was housed in Independence Hall until 1838, when it was moved the
              first of two times. Finally, in 1850 its contents were sold, in part to P. T. Barnum
              and in part to the Boston Museum. Some of the materials from the latter eventually
              were passed on to Harvard University, but most have disappeared, including the
              prairie dog.</p>

              shoreline distance. These reservations are home to the Lower Brule and Crow Creek
              components of the Lakotas. A Native American National Scenic Byway (Bureau of Indian
              Affairs Highways 10 and 4) crosses both reservations, linking Chamberlain and
              Pierre. This near-wilderness road passes scenic rolling hills that are often capped
              with infertile blackish Pierre shales of Cretaceous age. The soils support
              arid-adapted plants such as some of the sages that were discovered by Lewis and

              herds. Fort Kiowa, built in 1822, was located just south of the Lower Brule
              Reservation, and Fort Defiance, built in 1842, was located within it, as was Fort

              the west shore of the Missouri River (now a Fort Pierre city park), that the Corps
              of Discovery met three Lakota (Brule) chiefs and their warriors. It proved to be a
              danger-fraught encounter that led to threats and near-bloodshed over gifts and
              trading procedures, probably caused or at least exacerbated by translation problems.
              Also in Pierre is the South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center, with such items as an

              1804. It was here that the first Arikara ("Rikara") village was encountered by Lewis
              and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, at the mouth of the Grand
              River. A smallpox epidemic in 1780-81 had already killed most of the population of
              perhaps originally as many as 30,000 people. By 1800 the Arikaras consisted of about
              3,800 persons. Like the

              Dakota Highway 1806.

              <name type="person" key="Lisa, Manuel">Manuel</name>, a Missouri Fur Company post
              that was located in what is now Corson County, South Dakota, near the present North
              Dakota border. She died in December 1812, not long after giving birth to a daughter,
              Lizette. Although her exact burial site is unknown, it has probably been covered by
              Lake Oahe. After the death of his mother, Jean Baptiste spent a few years with 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>in St. Louis but later
              traveled abroad, became a mountain man and guide, and died of pneumonia at the age
              of 61 in Oregon. About a hundred yards away is a huge (seven-ton) granite bust of
              Sitting Bull, the great Lakota chief of the Indian wars, who was reburied here in
              1953 after an initial interment at Fort Yates, North Dakota. He had surrendered in
              1881 and been brought to Fort Union, North Dakota, several years after fleeing to
              Canada with the survivors of his Hunkpapa community. Sitting Bull spent most of the
              period from 1883 to 1890 at the Standing Rock reservation. In 1890 he was shot and
              killed there, together with his son and six policemen, while he was being detained
              by American Indian police, having been falsely accused of fostering the messianic
              Ghost Dance ritual then sweeping the western plains. This episode happened a year
              after Dakota Territory was divided into the present states of North and South

                     <p>The enormous Cheyenne River Indian Reservation (1.4 million acres) borders the
              west side of Lake Oahe for much of its length, and is home to four bands of Lakotas.
              This reservation encompasses the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>campsites of October 10-12,
              1804. The even larger Standing Rock Indian Reservation (2,328,534 acres), current
              home to some of the Dakota- and Lakota-dialect branches of the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>nation, continues along
              the west shoreline into southwestern North Dakota, north to about 25 miles beyond
              Fort Yates. The reservation was named for a rock that is sacred to the Arikaras and
              Lakotas and whose form resembles that of a seated woman. It is located across from
              the Agency Headquarters at Fort Yates. The reservation encompasses the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>outward-bound campsites of
              October 14-17, 1804, and the return campsites of August 20-21, 1806. There are
              annual summer powwows (held in July at Standing Rock, in August at Cheyenne River)
              and tribal bison herds. Before the Civil War all of South Dakota west of the
              Missouri was made part of a vast 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>Indian reservation, but
              in the 1870s the federal government violated its own treaty and subdivided it. Much
              of this region was then taken from the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>, including their sacred
              Black Hills, where gold had been discovered during General Custer's military survey
              in 1874. There are still nearly 5 million acres of reservation lands in South
              Dakota, totaling nine reservations and supporting about 57,000 residents, counting
              three reservations whose boundaries extend into Nebraska or North Dakota. The Pine
              Ridge and Rosebud Reservations of southwestern South Dakota support the state's
              largest number of reservation members, the Oglala and Brule, both composing part of
              the Lakotas. Other groups live on the Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, and the Wood
              Mountain (in Canada) Reservations. The western Lakota group comprised seven major
              subgroups or tribal bands, including such famous names as the Oglala, Brule, and
              Hunkpapa. Under the leadership of chiefs like Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, the men
              of these bands took their long-awaited revenge on General Custer at the Battle of
              Little Bighorn. The middle group included the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yankton</name>and the
              Yanktonai subgroups. The major tribal subgroups of the eastern Dakotas included the

              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>. By 1764 the

              3,600 people, as compared with about 2,500 Hidatsas (or Minitari; the "Minnetaree"
              of Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>). Compared with the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, the Hidatsas were
              relatively fierce, often fighting at the extreme western end of their range with the

              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>population to only

                     <p>This very large reservation (about 1 million acres) occupies much of both sides
              of Lake Sakakawea, which has impounded 368,000 acres and has 1,600 miles of
              shoreline. It is home to the Arikaras, Hidatsas (
              <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minitaris</name>), and 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, all well known to
              Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. Fort Berthold was built in
              1845 by the American Fur Company as a trading post, to be near the 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and Hidatsa villages
              then being established about 60 river miles upstream from Fort 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>. The reservation
              encompasses the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>campsites of April 10-15, 1805.
              Near the north end of the reservation and 11 miles west of New Town on U.S. Highway
              23 is Four Bears Park. A reservation museum (the Three Tribes Museum) near New Town
              is run by the Three Affiliated Tribes. It details the history of the Arikaras, 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, and Hidatsas,
              including their encounters with Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and features a reconstructed
              full-sized earth lodge. Three miles south of New Town on North Dakota Highway 23 is
              Crow Flies High Butte Historic Site and associated exhibits. The top of this butte
              provides a panoramic view of the nearby badlands and upland topography; the river
              valley itself is now entirely impounded. The butte is named for a Hidatsa chief who
              founded a nearby village. It was approximately at this point that 
              <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and his party
              finally caught up with

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>campsite of April 15, 1805. It
              is only part of a vast region (1,027,852 acres) of federally owned shortgrass
              prairies and badlands that in part extend to the south shore of Lake Sakakawea. This
              relatively small section is located generally to the north of Keene and is best
              reached by taking State Highway 1806 east and north from Watford City. A larger
              section of this enormous national grassland, the largest federally owned grassland
              in the United States, lies along the Little Missouri River. It is headquartered in
              Dickinson. Theodore Roosevelt National Park (70,416 acres) is located in two
              separate sections within this larger unit of the grassland. There bighorn sheep and
              other large ungulates familiar to Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>may sometimes be seen. These
              grasslands and eroded badlands also provide habitat for a wide array of other high
              plains mammals and birds. A checklist of 286 bird species occurring in southwestern
              North Dakota (including the entire region southwest of the Missouri River) has been
              compiled by Terry Rich. Several of these species were originally discovered by Lewis
              and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, including the greater
              sage-grouse, common poor-will, and McCown's longspur. Golden eagles and prairie
              falcons are also regular nesters here. A comparable list of 50 mammal species
              occurring in the same general region has been produced by Robert Seabloom and
              others. It includes several species that were discovered by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, such as the white-tailed
              jackrabbit, black-tailed prairie dog, bushy-tailed woodrat, swift fox, and mule

              Fort Union (built in 1828) has been accurately recreated since 1966 on a 443-acre
              site, with reconstructed walls, bastions, and a trade house. The Bourgeois House
              serves as a museum and visitor center. This trading post was built by John J.
              Astor's American Fur Company in 1828, and remained active until 1867. It was 1,776
              river miles from St. Louis and a major frontier fur-trading center. There is a bird
              checklist of 138 species. Two rather rare mixed-grass-prairie bird species, the
              Sprague's pipit and Baird's sparrow, were both discovered here by John J. Audubon
              about four decades after Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>passed through. The Fort Union
              Trading Post site is near the Fort Burford State Historic Site (see below), and both
              were built close to the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, where
              Fort Williams was also built in 1832. The Fort Union Trading Post was the largest in
              the American West, and was often visited by Native Americans representing the Crows,
              Crees, Blackfoot, 
              <name type="native_nation" key="Assiniboine Indians">Assiniboine</name>, and

              There are only a few remnants of Fort Burford still visible, including the stone
              powder magazine, the Officer of the Day building, a restored field officer's
              quarters that is now a museum, and a military cemetery. It was to Fort Burford that
              Chief Joseph was brought with 400 of his Nez Percé tribe after their failed attempt
              to escape into Canada, and Fort Burford is also where Sitting Bull surrendered in

              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>campsites of May 7-24, 1805.
              The refuge has a bird checklist of 252 species and a list of over 40 mammal species.
              Birds breeding here that were observed by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>while they were in the Great
              Plains include the golden eagle, greater sage-grouse, long-billed curlew, American
              avocet, willet, common poor-will, and black-billed magpie. Large mammals include
              pronghorns, mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, and bighorns. Smaller mammals that
              are present and were discovered by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>include the black-tailed
              prairie dog, bushy-tailed woodrat, and white-tailed jackrabbit. There are an
              estimated 4,500 acres of prairie-dog towns, providing potential habitat for
              critically endangered black-footed ferrets, which have been released here in a
              restoration effort. One major access route to the western part of the refuge is
              possible by traveling northeast from Lewiston for 67 miles via U.S. Highway 191.
              Interior refuge roads are unimproved and often impassable for most vehicles. Camping

              of the Marias River east for about 40 air miles or 55 river miles and are not
              visible by normal land access. A scenic area of similar length called the Missouri
              River Badlands occurs downstream. An 81-mile road loop starting and ending at
              Winfred is called the Missouri Breaks National Back Country Byway, but this
              unimproved road is suitable only for high-clearance vehicles during good weather.
              About nine miles west of the mouth of the Judith River, and about 1.5 miles
              downstream from the mouth of Arrow Creek ("Slaughter Creek" of Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>), is the site of the buffalo
              jump described by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, where they found more than a
              hundred dead bison, the animals having been stampeded by Native Americans off the
              brink of the steep cliffs. There is a local bird checklist of 233 species, including
              many of the same species that are found in the Charles M. Russell NWR. It
              encompasses the Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>campsites of May 24-June 13,

                     <p>At this point the expedition halted, and spent the period from June 2 to June 12
              trying to establish whether the rather muddy northwestern fork or the clearer
              southwestern fork represented the Missouri River. Assuming that clear water meant
              that the southwestern stream must be coming from nearby mountains, they eventually
              made the proper choice and called the other stream "Maria's River," later simplified
              to the Marias River. They left the area in search of the Great Falls on June 12,
              leaving behind the larger pirogue and a cache of supplies that they planned to
              retrieve during the return phase. Thirteen months later, the pirogue was found to
              have rotted, and some of the stored materials had been flooded and destroyed,
              including many of the preserved plant specimens.</p>

                     <p>A 216-acre state park with one of the largest freshwater springs in the world.
              Located near the Lewis and

              June 1805. Nearby is Sulfur Springs, whose mineral-rich waters reputedly saved 
              <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>'s life from a life-threatening
              illness. The Giant Springs were discovered by 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>on June 18, 1805, and
              still produce a vast output of nearly 400 million gallons of water daily. They also
              represent the downstream end of the portage around Great Falls, historically a
              nine-mile series of five separate falls and intervening rapids, the falls
              representing a collective vertical height of nearly 200 feet. At the upper end of
              this long (18-mile) portage around the falls were several islands named the White
              Bear Islands by Lewis and 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>because of the numerous grizzly
              bears they found there. During the outward-bound phase of the expedition, 11 days
              (June 21 to July 2, 1804) were needed for the overland route; on the return phase
              only eight days were needed, as horses were then available for hauling. Also located

              Holter Dam has raised the river's water level about 100 feet and is one of three
              dams in the region (the others are Hauser and Canyon Ferry) that have collectively
              produced a nearly continuous 70-mile impoundment. Nearby, along Prickly Pear Creek,
              is where Lewis first briefly observed Lewis's woodpecker, which he later (May 27,
              1806) described in detail from a specimen shot in Idaho. Camping is permitted.</p>

              The site was first recognized by Lewis and

              origin of the Missouri River, although the actual snowmelt headwaters derive from
              many small sources high in the mountains. 
              <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>and his group were the
              first members of the expedition to arrive at the headwaters on July 25 and were
              followed by the rest of the group on July 27. The entire expedition remained there
