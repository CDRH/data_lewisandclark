          <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>visited the indian Villages
          this morning and returned in the evening. 
          <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>brought with him the dressed
          skin of a bear which he had purchased for 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>   this skin was an
          uniform pale redish brown colour, the indians informed us that it was not the 
          <hi rend="italic">Hoh-host</hi>or white bear, that it was the Yâck-kâh.
          <ref target="n35053101" n="1"/>   this distinction of the indians induced us
          to make further enquiry relative to their opinions of the several speceis of bear in
          this country.    we produced the several skins of the bear which we had killed
          at this place and one very nearly white which I had purchased. The white, the deep and
          plale red grizzle, the dark bron grizzle, and all those which had the extremities of the
          hair of a white or frosty colour without regard to the colour of the ground of the poil,
          they designated Hoh-host and assured us that they were the same with the white bear,
          that they ascosiated together, were very vicisious, never climbed the trees, and had
          much longer nails than the others.    the black skins, those which were black
          with a number of intire white hairs intermixed, the black with a white breast, the
          uniform bey, brown and light redish brown, they designated the Yâck-kâh;—said that they
          climbed the trees, had short nails and were not vicious, that they could pursue them and
          kill them with safety, they also affirmed that they were much smaller than the white
          bear. I am disposed to adopt the Indian distinction with rispect to these bear and
          consider them two distinct speceis.    the white and the grizzly of this
          neighbourhood are the same of those found on the upper portion of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>where the other speceis are not,
          and that the uniform redish brown black &amp;c of this neighbourhood are a speceis
          distinct from our black bear and from the black bear of the 
          <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>coast which I believe to be the
          same with those of the 
          <name type="place" key="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</name>coast, and that the common black
          bear do not exist here. I had previously observed that the claws of some of the bear
          which we had killed here had much shorter tallons than the variagated or white bear
          usually have but supposed that they had woarn them out by scratching up roots, and these
          were those which the indians called Yâh-kâh.    on enquiry I found also that a
          cub of an uniform redish brown colour, pup to a female black bear intermixed with entire
          white hairs had climbed a tree. I think this a distinct speceis from the common black
          bear, because we never find the latter of any other colour than an uniform black, and
          also that the poil of this bear is much finer thicker and longer with a greater
          proportion of fur mixed with the hair, in other ispects they are much the same.—
             This evening 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Feilds</name>returned with the three deer
          which they had killed. The Indians brought us another of our origional Stock of horses;
          there are only two absent now of those horses, and these the indians inform us that our 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">shoshone</name>guide
          <ref target="n35053102" n="2"/>rode back when he returned.    we have sixty
          five horses at this time, most of them in excellent order and fine strong active
          horses.—</p>
               <p>The Indians pursued a mule deer to the river opposite to our camp this evening; the
          deer swam over and one of our hunters killed it.    there being a large party
          of indians assembled on this occasion on the opposite side, 
          <name type="person" key="Hohots Ilppilp">Hohâst-ill-pilp</name>desired them to raise our
          canoe which was sunk on that side of the river yesterday; they made the attempt but were
          unable to effect it.—</p>

          <hi rend="italic">Hoh-host</hi>and assured us that they were the Same with the White
          bear, that they associated together, were very vicisious, never climb the trees, and had

          was seen swimming the river and some of our men killed it. Our canoe still lies under
          water at the opposite shore, but we have a small Indian canoe, that serves to cross in.
          In the afternoon the two men came from the village with some of the natives, and one of
