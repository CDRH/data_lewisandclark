               </ab>
               <p>Set out at an early hour; I proceeded with the party and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>with 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drewyer</name>walked on shore in
          order to procure some fresh meat if possible.    we proceeded on abot five
          miles, and halted for breakfast, when 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>joined us; the latter had
          killed, and brought with him a deer which was at this moment excepable as we had had no
          fresh meat for several days.    the country from fort 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>to this place is so
          constantly hunted by the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetaries</name>that there is but
          little game we halted at two P. M. and made a comfortable dinner on a venison stake and
          beavers tales with the bisquit which got wet on the 8th inst. by the accidant of the
          canoe filling with water before mentioned.    the powder which got wet by the
          same accedent, and which we had spread to dry on the baggage of the large perogue, was
          now examined and put up; it appears to be almost restored, and our loss is therefore not
          so great as we had at first apprehended.—    the country much the same as
          yesterday.    on the sides of the hills and even the banks of the rivers and
          sandbars, there is a white substance t[h]at appears in considerable quantities on the
          surface of the earth, which tastes like a mixture of common salt and glauber salts.
             many of the springs which flow from the base of the river hills are so
          strongly impregnated with this substance that the water is extreemly unpelasant to the
          taste and has a purgative effect.—
          <ref target="n11041101" n="1"/>   saw some 
          <ref target="n11041102" n="2">large white cranes pass up the river—</ref>  
          these are the largest bird of that genus common to the country through which the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>and 
          <name type="place" key="Mississippi River">Mississippi</name>pass. they are perfectly
          white except the large feathers of the two first joints of the wing which are black.
             we encamped this evening on the Stard. shore just above the point of
          woodland which formed to extremity of the last course of this day.
          <ref target="n11041103" n="3"/>   there is a high bluff opposite to us, under
          which we saw some Indians, but the river is here so wide that we could not speake to
          them; suppose them to be a hunting party of 
          <name type="place" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minetares</name>.—    we killed two
          gees today.</p>
