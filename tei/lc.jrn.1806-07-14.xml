               <p>Had the carriage wheels dug up    found them in good order.   
          the iron frame of the boat had not suffered materially.    had the meat cut
          thiner and exposed to dry in the sun.    and some roots of cows of which I
          have yet a small stock pounded into meal for my journey. I find the fat buffaloe meat a
          great improvement to the mush of these roots.    the old cash being too damp
          to venture to deposit my trunks &amp;c in I sent them over to the Large island and had
          them put on a high scaffold among some thick brush and covered with skins. I take this
          precaution lest some indians may visit the men I leave here before the arrival of the
          main party and rob them.    the hunters killed a couple of wolves, the
          buffaloe have almost entirely disappeared.    saw the bee martin.   
          the wolves are in great numbers howling arround us and loling about in the plains in
          view at the distance of two or three hundred yards. I counted 27 about the carcase of a
          buffaloe which lies in the water at the upper point of the large island.   
          these are generally of the large kind.

                  <hi rend="italic">Monday 14th.</hi>   There was a pleasant morning.— We staid
          here also to day; and the musketoes continued to torment us until about noon, when a
          fine breeze of wind arose and drove them, for a while away. We deposited the most
          valuable part of our baggage and stores on a large island so that if the Indians came
          they would not get it.</p>
