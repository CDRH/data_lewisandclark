               <p>This morning at day light the indians got up and crouded around the fire, 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>who was on post had carelessly
          laid his gun down behid him near where his brother was sleeping, one of the indians the
          fellow to whom I had given the medal last evening sliped behind him and took his gun and
          that of his brothers unperceived by him, at the same instant two others advanced and
          seized the guns of 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and myself, 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Fields</name>seing this turned about to look
          for his gun and saw the fellow just runing off with her and his brothers he called to
          his brother who instantly jumped up and pursued the indian with him whom they overtook
          at the distance of 50 or 60 paces from the camp sized their guns and rested them from
          him and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R Fields</name>as he seized his gun stabed the
          indian to the heart with his knife    the fellow ran about 15 steps and fell
          dead;
          <ref target="n37072701" n="1"/>of this I did not know untill afterwards, having
          recovered their guns they ran back instantly to the camp; 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>who was awake saw the indian
          take hold of his gun and instantly jumped up and sized her and rested her from him but
          the indian still retained his pouch, his jumping up and crying damn you let go my gun
          awakened me    I jumped up and asked what was the matter which I quickly
          learned when I saw 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">drewyer</name>in a scuffle with the indian
          for his gun. I reached to seize my gun but found her gone, I then drew a pistol from my
          holster and terning myself about saw the indian making off with my gun    I
          ran at him with my pistol and bid him lay down my gun 〈at the instant〉 which he was in
          the act of doing when the 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fieldses</name>returned and drew up
          their guns to shoot him which I forbid as he did not appear to be about to make any
          resistance or commit any offensive act, he droped the gun and walked slowly off, I
          picked her up instantly, 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>having about this time
          recovered his gun and pouch asked me if he might not kill the fellow which I also forbid
          as the indian did not appear to wish to kill us, as soon as they found us all in
          possession of our arms they ran and indeavored to drive off all the horses   
          I now hollowed to the men and told them to fire on them if they attempted to drive off
          our horses, they accordingly pursued the main party who were drving the horses up the
          river and I pursued the man who had taken my gun who with another was driving off a part
          of the horses which were to the left of the camp, I pursued them so closely that they
          could not take twelve of their own horses but continued to drive one of mine with some
          others; at the distance of three hundred paces they entered one of those steep nitches
          in the bluff with the horses before them    being nearly out of breath I could
          pursue no further, I called to them as I had done several times before that I would
          shoot them if they did not give me my horse and raised my gun, one of them jumped behind
          a rock and spoke to the other who turned around and stoped at the distance of 30 steps
          from me and I shot him through the belly,
          <ref target="n37072702" n="2"/>he fell to his knees and on his wright elbow from which
          position he partly raised himself up and fired at me, and turning himself about crawled
          in behind a rock which was a few feet from him.    he overshot me, being
          bearheaded I felt the wind of his bullet very distinctly.
          <ref target="n37072703" n="3"/>   not having my shotpouch I could not reload
          my peice and as there were two of them behind good shelters from me I did not think it
          prudent to rush on them with my pistol which had I discharged I had not the means of
          reloading untill I reached camp; I therefore returned leasurely towards camp, on my way
          I met with 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>who having heared the report
          of the guns had returned in surch of me and left the 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fieldes</name>to pursue the indians,
          I desired him to haisten to the camp with me and assist in catching as many of the
          indian horses as were necessary and to call to the 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fieldes</name>if he could make them
          hear to come back that we still had a sufficient number of horses, this he did but they
          were too far to hear him.    we reached the camp and began to catch the horses
          and saddle them and put on the packs.    the reason I had not my pouch with me
          was that I had not time to return about 50 yards to camp after geting my gun before I
          was obliged to pursue the indians or suffer them to collect and drive off all the
          horses.    we had caught and saddled the horses and began to arrange the packs
          when the 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Fieldses</name>returned with four of
          our horses; we left one of our horses and took four of the best of those of the
          indian's; while the men were preparing the horses I put four sheilds and two bows and
          quivers of arrows which had been left on the fire, with sundry other articles; they left
          all their baggage at our mercy.    they had but 2 guns and one of them they
          left    the others were armed with bows and arrows and eyedaggs.
          <ref target="n37072704" n="4"/>   the gun we took with us. I also retook the
          flagg but left the medal about the neck of the dead man that they might be informed who
          we were.    we took some of their buffaloe meat and set out ascending the
          bluffs by the same rout we had decended last evening leaving the ballance of nine of
          their horses which we did not want.    the    
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph and Reubin">Feildses</name>told me that three of
          the indians whom they pursued swam the river one of them on my horse.    and
          that two others ascended the hill and escaped from them with a part of their horses, two
          I had pursued into the nitch one lay dead near the camp and the eighth we could not
          account for but suppose that he ran off early in the contest. having ascended the hill
          we took our course through a beatiful level plain a little to the S of East.
             my design was to hasten to the entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>as quick as possible in the
          hope of meeting with the canoes and party at that place having no doubt but that they
          would pursue us with a large party and as there was a band near the broken mountains or
          probably between them and the mouth of that river we might expect them to receive
          inteligence from us and arrive at that place nearly as soon as we could, no time was
          therefore to be lost and we pushed our horses as hard as they would bear.   
          at 8 miles we passed a large branch 40 yds. wide which I called 
          <name type="place" key="Birch (Battle) Creek (Pondera County, Mont.)">battle
          river</name>.
          <ref target="n37072705" n="5"/>   at 3 P. M. we arrived at 
          <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">rose river</name>about 5 miles above
          where we had passed it as we went out, having traveled by my estimate compared with our
          former distances and couses about 63 ms.
          <ref target="n37072706" n="6"/>here we halted an hour and a half took some refreshment
          and suffered our horses to graize; the day proved warm but the late rains had supplyed
          the little reservors in the plains with water and had put them in fine order for
          traveling, our whole rout so far was as level as a bowling green with but little stone
          and few prickly pears.    after dinner we pursued the bottoms of 
          <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">rose river</name>but finding
          inconvenient to pass the river so often we again ascended the hills on the S. W. side
          and took the open plains; by dark we had traveled about 17 miles further, we now halted
          to rest ourselves and horses about 2 hours, we killed a buffaloe cow and took a small
          quantity of the meat.    after refreshing ourselves we again set out by moon
          light and traveled leasurely, heavy thunderclouds lowered arround us on every quarter
          but that from which the moon gave us light.    we contineud to pass immence
          herds of buffaloe all night as we had done in the latter part of the day.   
          we traveled untill 2 OCk in the morning having come by my estimate after dark about 20
          ms.    we now turned out our horses and laid ourselves down to rest in the
          plain very much fatiegued as may be readily conceived.
          <ref target="n37072707" n="7"/>   my indian horse carried me very well in
          short much better than my own would have done and leaves me with but little reason to
          complain of the robery.</p>

          and one of the men
          <ref target="n37072723" n="23"/>crossed the river with the horses, in order to go by
          land to the mouth of 
          <name type="place" key="Marias River">Maria's river</name>: the rest of the party here
          are to go by water. We proceeded on through the plains about twenty miles, and in our
          way saw a great many buffaloe. We then struck 
          <name type="place" key="Teton (Rose, Tansy) River">Tansy or Rose river</name>,
          <ref target="n37072724" n="24"/>which we kept down about ten miles, and encamped.
          <ref target="n37072725" n="25"/>The land along this river is handsomely covered with
          Cotton wood timber and there is an abundance of game of different kinds. In our way we
          killed a buffaloe and a goat.
          <ref target="n37072726" n="26"/>The wolves in packs occasinally hunt these goats, which
          are too swift to be run down and taken by a single wolf. The wolves having fixed upon
          their intended prey and taken their stations, a part of the pack commence the chase, and
          running it in a circle, are at certain intervals relieved by others. In this manner they
          are able to run a goat down. At the falls where the wolves are plenty, I had an
          opportunity of seeing one of these hunts.</p>

        north bank of the river a few miles upstream from his evening's camp. The decreased size
        of the stones or cobbles in the river bed results both from the continual striking of

        power of the river after it emerges into the plains country—the large cobbles are left
        farther upstream.</note>
