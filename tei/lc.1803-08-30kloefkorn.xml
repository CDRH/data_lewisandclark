               <hi rend="right"/>Left Pittsburgh this day at 11 ock with a party of 11 hands 7 of which
        are soldiers, a pilot and three young men on trial they having proposed to go with me
        throughout the voyage. Arrived at Bruno's Island 3 miles below    halted a few
        minutes.    went on shore and being invited on by some of the gentlemen present
        to try my 
        <hi rend="italic">airgun</hi>which I had purchased brought it on shore charged it and
        fired myself seven times fifty five yards with pretty good success; after which a 
        <name type="person" key="Cenas, Blaze">Mr. Blaze Cenas</name>being unacquainted with the
        management of the gun suffered her to discharge herself accedentaly    the ball
        passed through the hat of a woman about 40 yards distanc cuting her temple about the
        fourth of the diameter of the ball; shee fell instantly and the blood gusing from her
        temple    we were all in the greatest consternation    supposed she
        was dead by [but] in a minute she revived to our enespressable satisfaction, and by
        examination we found the wound by no means mortal or even dangerous</p>
