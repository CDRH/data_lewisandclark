               <p>about noon The 3 Cheifs
          <ref target="n35060401" n="1"/>left us and returned to their vilages.   
          while they were with us we repeated the promises we had formerly made them and invited
          them to the Missouri with us, they declined going untill the latter end of the summer
          and said it was there intention to spend the ensuing winter on the East side of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rocky mountains</name>.    they gave
          us no positive answer to a request which we made, that two or three of their young men

                  <ref target="n35060402" n="2"/>where it was probable I should meet with some of the

          <name type="place" key="Fort des Prairies (Canada)">Fort de Prarie</name>;
          <ref target="n35060403" n="3"/>that in such case I should indeavor to bring about a
          good understanding between those indians and themselves, which when effected they would
          be informed of it though the young men thus sent with me, and that on the contrary
          should I not be fortunate enough to meet with these people nor to prevail on them to be
          at peace they would equally be informed through those young men, and they might still
          remain on their guard with rispect to them untill the whites had it in their power to
          give them more effectual releif. The 
          <name type="person" key="Broken Arm">Broken Arm</name>invited us to his village and said
          he wished to speak to us before we set out, and that he had some roots to give us for
