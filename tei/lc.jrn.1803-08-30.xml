               drawings and measurements in <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>Field Notes (see below, fig. 7 and accompanying notes). The craft was

               of 1803, presumably to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>specifications, and was somewhat modified at the <name type="place" key="Dubois River">River Dubois</name>, <name type="place" key="Illinois">Illinois</name>, camp during the winter of 1803–4. It was fifty-five feet in
               length, with an eight-foot beam, a thirty-two-foot mast, a shallow draft, and a hold
               thirty-one feet long. At the stern was a cabin with a deck on top, and there was a
               ten-foot deck at the bow. As <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>drawings show, it was basically a galley, little resembing the classic
               keelboat of the "Western Waters." It does strongly resemble a Spanish river galley of
               the 1790s illustrated in Nasatir (SWV), frontispiece—apparently a drawing by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. This seems to have been a
