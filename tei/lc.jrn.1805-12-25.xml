          at their quarters at day break this morning.    they divided out the last of
          their tobacco among the men that used and the rest they gave each a Silk hankerchief, as
          a Christmast gift, to keep us in remembrence of it as we have no ardent Spirits, but are
          all in good health which we esteem more than all the ardent Spirits in the world.
             we have nothing to eat but poore Elk meat and no Salt to Season that with

                  <hi rend="italic">Wednesday 25th.</hi>   Was another cloudy wet day.— This
          morning we left our camp and moved into our huts. At daybreak all the men paraded and
          fired a round of small arms, wishing the Commanding Officers a merry Christmas. In the
          course of the day 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clarke</name>collected what tobacco
          remained, and divided it amongst those who used tobacco, as Christmas-gift; to the
          others they gave handkerchiefs in lieu of it. We had no spirituous liquors to elevate
          our spirits this Christmas; but of this we had but little need, as we were all in very
          good health. Our living is not very good; meat is in plenty, but of an ordinary quality,
          as the elk are poor in this part of the country. We have no kind of provisions but meat,
          and we are without salt to season that.</p>
               <p>The 26th, 27th and 28th, were cloudy with rain. We found our huts smoked; there being
          no chimneys in them except in the officers' rooms. The men were therefore employed,
          except some hunters who went out, in making chimnies to the huts. In the evening of the
          27th we were informed that a large fish, answering to the description of a whale, was
          driven upon shore. In the forenoon of the 28th six men
          <ref target="n26122503" n="3"/>started for the sea shore to make salt, as we have none
          in the fort. Two hunters returned, having killed a deer, and three went out to hunt.

               <p>Wednesday Decemr. 25th    We had hard rain &amp; Cloudy weather as usual.
             We all moved into our new Garrison or Fort, which our Officers named after
          a nation of Indians who resided near us, called the

               <p>We saluted our officers, by each of our party firing off his gun at day break in
          honor to the day (Christmass[)]    Our Officers in return, presented to each
          of the party that used Tobacco a part of what Tobacco they had remaining; and to those
          who did not make use of it, they gave a handerchief or some other article, in
          remembrance of Christmass.    We had no ardent spirit of any kind among us;
          but are mostly in good health, A blessing, which we esteem more, than all the luxuries
          this life can afford, and the party are all thankful to the Supreme Being, for his
          goodness towards us.—    hoping he will preserve us in the same, &amp; enable
          us to return to the United States again in safety.    We have at present
          nothing to eat but lean Elk meat &amp; that without Salt, but the whole of our party are
          content with this fare.—</p>
