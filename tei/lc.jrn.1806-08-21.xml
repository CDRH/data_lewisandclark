          <ref target="n39082116" n="16"/>and halted. In our way here we met three Frenchmen in a

          traders, wished to go with us to the United States; which our Commanding Officers
          consented to and he was taken on board one of our canoes. When we halted and landed at

          they declared they would live in peace with all nations; but that their chiefs and
          warriors would not go to the United States at present, as they had sent one chief
          already, and he had not returned. There are also a great many of the

          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>gave one of their chiefs a
          medal, which he gave back with a buffaloe robe, and said he was afraid of white people,
