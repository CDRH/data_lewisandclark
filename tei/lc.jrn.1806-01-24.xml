          <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">Baptiest La Paage</name>returned this
          morning in a large Canoe with 
          <name type="person" key="Coboway">Comowooll</name>and six 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Clatsop Indians">Clatsops</name>.    they
          brought two deer and the flesh of three Elk &amp; one Elk's skin, having given the flesh
          of one other Elk which they killed and three Elk's skins to the Indians as the price of
          their assistance in transporting the ballance of the meat to the Fort; these Elk and
          deer were killed near 
          <name type="place" key="Point Adams">point Adams</name>and the Indians carryed them on
          their backs about six miles, before the waves were sufficiently low to permit their
          being taken on board their canoes.    the Indians remained with us all day.
          The Indians witnissed 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer's</name>shooting some of those Elk
          which has given them a very exalted opinion of us as marksmen and the superior
          excellence of our rifles compared with their guns; this may probably be of service to
          us, as it will deter them from any acts of hostility if they have ever meditated any
          such. My Air-gun also astonishes them very much, they cannot comprehend it's shooting so
          often and without powder; and think that it is 
          <hi rend="italic">great medicine</hi>which comprehends every thing that is to them
          incomprehensible.—</p>
               <p>I observe no difference between the liquorice of this country and that common to many
          parts of the United States where it is also sometimes cultivated in our gardens.
             this plant delights in a deep loose sandy soil; here it grows very abundant
          and large; the natives roast it in the embers and pound it slightly with a small stick
          in order to make it seperate more readily from the strong liggament which forms the
          center of the root; this the natives discard and chew and swallow the ballance of the
          root; this last is filled with a number of thin membrenacious lamela like net work, too
          tough to be masticated and which I find it necessary also to discard.    this
          root when roasted possesses an agreeable flavour not unlike the sweet pittaitoe.
             beside the small celindric root mentioned on the 20th inst., they have also
          another about the same form size and appearance which they use much with the train oil,
          this root is usually boiled; to me it possesses a disagreeable bitterness.   
          the top of this plant I have never yet seen. The root of the thistle after undergoing
          the prossess of sweating or baking in a kiln is sometimes eaten with the train oil also,
          and at other times pounded find and mixed with could water untill reduced to the
          consistency of sagamity
          <ref target="n28012401" n="1"/>or indian mush; in this way I think it very agreeable.
             but the most valuable of their roots is foreign to this neighbourhood
             I mean the 
          <hi rend="italic">Wappetoe,</hi>or the bulb of the Sagitifolia or common arrow head,
          which grows in great abundance in the marshey grounds of that beatifull and firtile
          valley on the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>commencing just above the
          entrance of 
          <name type="place" key="Sandy (Quicksand) River">Quicksand River</name>, and extending
          downwards for about 70 Miles.    this bulb forms a principal article of
          traffic between the inhabitants of the valley and those of this neighbourhood or sea
          coast. The instrument used by the natives in diging their roots is a strong stick of 3½
          feet long sharpened at the lower end and it's upper inscerted into a part of an Elks or
          buck's horn which serves as a handle, standing transversely with the stick or it is in
          this form
          <ref target="n28012402" n="2"/>   A the lower point, B the upper part or
          handle.—</p>
