               <p>Set out early as usual; 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>left us with his little party
          of 4 men and continued his rout on the Stard. side of the river.    about 10
          OCk. A M. we came up with 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>who had seperated from us
          yesterday evening and lay out all night not being able to find where we had encamped.
             he had killed 5 deer which we took on board and continued our rout.
             the river is still divided by a great number of islands, it channels
          sometimes seperating to the distance of 3 miles; the current very rapid with a number of
          riffles; the bed gravel and smooth stones; the banks low and of rich loam in the
          bottoms; some low bluffs of yellow and red clay with a hard red slate stone intermixed.
          <ref target="n17072301" n="1"/>   the bottoms are wide and but scantily
          timbered; the underbrush very thick consisting of the narrow &amp; broad leafed willow
          rose and Currant bushes principally.    high plains succeeds the river bottoms
          and extend back on either side to the base of the mountains which are from 8 to 12 miles
          assunder, high, rocky, some small pine and Cedar on them and ly parallel with the river.
             passed a large creek on Lard. side 20 yds. wide which after meandering
          through a beautifull and extensive bottom for several miles nearly parallel with the
          river discharges itself opposite to a large cluster of islands which from their number I
          called the 10 islands and the creek 
          <name type="place" key="Ray Creek (Broadwater County, Mont.)">Whitehous's Creek</name>,
          <ref target="n17072302" n="2"/>after 
          <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Josph. Whitehouse</name>one of the party.
             saw a great abundance of the common thistles;
          <ref target="n17072303" n="3"/>also a number of the wild onions of which we collected a
          further supply.    there is a species of garlic
          <ref target="n17072304" n="4"/>also which grows on the high lands with a flat leaf now
          green and in bloe but is strong tough and disagreeable.    found some seed of
          the wild flax ripe which I preserved; this plant grows in great abundance in these
          bottoms. I halted rearther early for dinner today than usual in order to dry some
          articles which had gotten wet in several of the canoes. I ordered the canoes to hoist
          their small flags in order that should the indians see us they might discover that we
          were not Indians, nor their enemies.    we made great uce of our seting poles
          and cords the uce of both which the river and banks favored.    most of our
          small sockets were lost, and the stones were so smooth that the points of their poles
          sliped in such manner that it increased the labour of navigating the canoes very
          considerably, I recollected a parsel of giggs which I had brought on, and made the men
          each atatch one of these to the lower ends of their poles with strong wire, which
          answered the desired purpose.    we saw Antelopes Crain gees ducks beaver and
          Otter.    we took up four deer which 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>&amp; party had killed and
          left near the river.    he pursued his rout untill late in the evening and
          encamped on the bank of the river 25 ms. above our encampment of the last evening;
          <ref target="n17072305" n="5"/>he followed an old indian road which lyes along the
          river on the stard side Capt. saw a number of Antelopes, and one herd of Elk.
             also much sign of the indians but all of ancient date. I saw the bull rush
          and Cattail flag today.—
