          a piece of Paint, and acknowledged them as chiefs; as we thought it necessary at this
          time to treat those people verry friendly &amp; ingratiate our Selves with them, to
          insure us a kind &amp; friendly reception on our return, we gave Small presents to
          Several, and half a Deer to them to eate.    we had also a fire made for those

               <p>Great numbers of white Crain flying in different Directions verry high—   
          The river rose 8 Inches to day from what cause I cannot Say certainly, as the tides
          cannot effect the river here as there is a falls below, I conjecture that the rise is
          owing to the winds which has Set up the river for 24 hours past.    our
          hunters inform that the countrey back is broken, Stoney and thinly timbered with pine
          and White Oake. They Saw Elk &amp; Bear Sign in the mountains. Dried all our wet

                  <hi rend="italic">Saturday 26th.</hi>   A fine morning. We hauled up all our
          canoes to dress and repair them, as they had been injured in passing over the portage,
          round the falls. Some hunters went out and killed 6 deer and some squirrels. In the
          afternoon about 20 of the natives came to our camp (among whom were the head chiefs of
          the two villages about the falls) who had been out hunting when we passed down. The
          Commanding Officers gave medals to the chiefs, and some other small articles; and they
          appeared satisfied and some remained with us all night.</p>

               <p>Saturday 26th Oct. 1805.    a clear pleasant morning.    we lay
          Campd. on the clift or pt. of rocks for Safety.    2 Sentinels to guard us.
             our officers conclude to delay here for observations and repair the canoes
          &amp;c.    So we unloaded all the canoes Shaved the bottoms Smooth and pay
          them over and made them in good repair &amp;c.    Several men out a hunting.
             a nomber of the natives visited us.    we dryed the articles
          which got wet in the canoe that filled yesterday.    one of the men giged a
          Sammon Trout in the River.    towards evening the hunters returned to Camp had
          killed 5 five Deer a goose and a gray Squirrel.    they Saw a great nomber of
          deer in the timbered land.    we Saw a great no. of geese and ducks.
             the Savages came in crafts to our Camp made of Solid wood but are made in
          form of Sciffs for the convenience of rideing the waves in high winds, or to coast along
          the Sea Shore.    Several of the Indians Stayed with us this night one of them

          the River began to raise about 4 oClock P. M. and raised Several Inches, the cause of
          which we think that the tide Swels a little up to this place.</p>
               <p>Saturday October 26th    A clear pleasant morning, and we continued at our
          Encampment near the point of rocks, with 2 Centinals placed to guard us.   
          Our hunters were sent out in order to hunt for game.    Our officers mean to
          delay here this day in order to ascertain the Latitude of this place, repair our Canoes
          &amp;ca.    We unloaded our Canoes, shaved their bottoms clean, payed them
          over with Pitch.    We also put the loading that had got wet, in the Canoe
          Yesterday Out in order to dry 〈them〉.    We had a number of the Natives at our
          Camp, to visit us.    One of our party gigged a large Salmon Trout in the
          River, which he brought to our Camp.    Towards Evening our hunters returned
          to the Camp.    They had killed 5 deer, 1 Goose &amp; a grey squirrel.
             They informed us, that they had seen a great number of deer, in the
          timbered land, We saw a great number of Ducks, &amp; Geese in the River this day.—
             The Indians came to our Camp this day, on Crafts made out of Cedar Wood.
             These Crafts were made in the form of a Skiff, for the convenience of
          riding the Waves in high winds; or to coast along the Sea shore.—    They were
          neatly formed &amp; dug out.—    Several of these Indians staid with us all
          Night, among which was one of their Chiefs.—
