          went out, and killed 10 Elk and 18 deer at that place, they were then 40 Miles distant
          from the Fort, as near as they could reckon.—    They there built a pen, to
          preserve their Meat in from the Wolves; &amp; other Animals.—    The Wolves at
          that place were very numerous and Ravenous.—    
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>then proceeded a small
          distance further down the River, and encamped.—
          <ref target="n090206-1203" n="3"/>   On Saturday the 9th instant
