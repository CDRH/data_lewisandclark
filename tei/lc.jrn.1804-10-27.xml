        indicate an expanded stomach. Travelers' accounts made the point that the tribe had no
        larger stomachs than others. The name has been a fruitful source of confusion, since "Gros
        Ventres" was a name also applied to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Atsina Indians">Atsinas</name>, a nomadic tribe of
        Algonquian language stock who apparently broke away from the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Arapaho Indians">Arapahoes</name>and lived well to the
        west of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>. Nineteenth-century
        writers attempted to resolve the confusion by distinguishing between the "Gros Ventres of
        the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>" (
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>) and the "Gros Ventres of
        the Prairie" (
        <name type="native_nation" key="Atsina Indians">Atsinas</name>). The 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>were of Siouan language
        family and lived in sedentary farming villages of earth lodges in 
        <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>found the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>in three villages near the
        mouth of 
        <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>, in 
        <name type="place" key="Mercer County, N. Dak.">Mercer County</name>. The first was that
        of the Amahami, or Awaxawi, described in a separate note above. Second going upstream was 
        <name type="place" key="Sakakawea site">Metaharta</name>, also called the 
        <name type="place" key="Sakakawea site">Sakakawea site</name>from its association with 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, the captains' 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>interpreter. The third
        village was 
        <name type="place" key="Big Hidatsa site">Big Hidatsa site</name>, home of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>proper. The captains
        frequently referred to the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>villages by numbers from
        south to north; the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>villages were numbers 1 and
        2, so the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>village was number
        3, Metaharta number 4, and 
        <name type="place" key="Big Hidatsa site">Big Hidatsa</name>number 5. See 
        <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>maps 29, 46, 55, and fig. 4. While ethnologists speak of one
        people called 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Minitaris</name>or 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>, there were at least
        three divisions within these people, corresponding roughly to the three villages, each
        conscious of being somewhat different in language, culture, and antecedents. In the
        southernmost village were the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>. The other two
        groups, distinct yet more closely allied in culture and language than were the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>, were the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>proper at 
        <name type="place" key="Big Hidatsa site">Big Hidatsa</name>, the northern village, and
        the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa</name>, at 
        <name type="place" key="Sakakawea site">Metaharta</name>, the middle village. 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa</name>is a 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>name, 
        <hi rend="italic">awatìxáa</hi>, "high village," while 
        <name type="place" key="Sakakawea site">Metaharta</name>is a 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>term, 
        <hi rend="italic">mi
        <seg n="u331">ŋ</seg>'tixata</hi>, "village spread out." The 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awatixa">Awatixa</name>claimed that they
        had always lived on the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, which suggests residence there
        beyond traditional memory. The 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>proper, like the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>, said they came
        from eastern 
        <name type="place" key="North Dakota">North Dakota</name>, the former being the last to
        arrive. Apparently the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>proper lived near the
        mouth of 
        <name type="place" key="Heart (Ches-che-tar and similar spellings) River">Heart
        River</name>before moving north to the 
        <name type="place" key="Knife River">Knife River</name>, where all three groups were
        established by 1787. A further complication is that archaeologists cannot distinguish
        between prehistoric 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>sites and those of the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>on the basis of artifacts.
        This suggests long association and close cultural connections between the two peoples, in
        spite of their own awareness of distinctiveness. All of these groups suffered from the
        great smallpox epidemic of the 1780s and from 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>attacks. Reduction of
        population and the need for a defensive alliance were no doubt responsible, at least in
        part, for the five 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>villages drawing closer
        together in the late eighteenth century. All of these groups were sedentary farmers in
        permanent earth lodge villages who hunted to supplement their agricultural products.
        However, the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>proper are said to have
        learned corn growing from the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>after they reached the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, and even at the time of 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>were apparently semi-nomadic. All the
        
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>seem to have had a
        stronger military tradition than the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>. 
        <name type="person" key="Bradbury, John">John Bradbury</name>noted in 1809 that the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>had only fifty
        warriors, yet they, like the others, carried out raids against the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshones</name>and 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>in the 
        <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockies</name>. It was in one of these 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>raids that 
        <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was captured. The smallpox epidemic of
        1837 further reduced the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>; 
        <name type="place" key="Sakakawea village">Metaharta</name>and the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians, Awaxawi">Awaxawi</name>village were
        destroyed by the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>in 1834. After the epidemic the
        
        <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsas</name>absorbed the remnants of
        the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>and moved to

        <name type="place" key="Fort Berthold (N. Dak.)">Fort Berthold</name>trading post, in

        <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikaras</name>joined them there and the
        defensive alliance of the three tribes, proposed by 
        <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, was finally consummated. The "Three
