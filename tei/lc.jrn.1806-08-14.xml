It is impossible to say where August 14 actually ends and the fifteenth begins. Presumably the material covering these days was written later and the heading for August 15 was misplaced. Coues (HLC), 3:1182 n. 10, believes most of the events given under August 14 belong to the fifteenth. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> notes on this date that "<name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt Lewis</name> fainted as <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> was dressing his wound, but Soon came too again."</note>
