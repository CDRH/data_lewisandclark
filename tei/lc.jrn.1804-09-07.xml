                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 7th.</hi>   We set sail early, and had a clear day:
          passed high prairie land on both sides; but there is some cotton wood on the low points
          in the bottoms. On the south side we found a scaffold of meat neatly dried. This had
          been left by one of our men,
          <ref target="n06090709" n="9"/>who had gone out on the 26th of the last month to hunt
          the horses, and supposing we had got a distance ahead, proceeded up the river several
          days journey, before he discovered his error. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clarke</name>with some of the men went
          to view a round knob of a hill in a prairie, and on their return killed a prairie dog,
          <ref target="n06090710" n="10"/>in size about that of the smallest species domestic
          dogs.</p>
               <p>Having understood that the village of those small dogs was at a short distance from
          our camp, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>and Captain 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke</name>with all the party, except the
          guard, went to it; and took with them all the kettles and other vessels for holding
          water; in order to drive the animals out of their holes by pouring in water; but though
          they worked at the business till night they only caught one of them.</p>

               <p>Friday Septemr. 7th    This morning being clear we set off early, One of
          our Hunters returned, having killed an animal &amp; brought in with him, which he called
          a Priari dog, and mentioned, that he had seen a large number of them, which had their
          habitations lying together, We halted,
