               <p>This morning we had considerable difficulty in collecting our horses they having
          straggled off to a considerable distance in surch of food on the sides of the mountains
          among the thick timber; at 9 OCk. we collected them all except one of 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyers</name>and one of 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Sheildes</name>; we set out leaving 
          <name type="person" key="Shields, John">Sheilds</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">LaPage</name>to collect the two lost
          horses and follow us. We dispatched 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>to the

          plains beyond the 
          <name type="place" key="Clearwater (Flathead, Kooskooskee) River">Kooskooske</name>in
          order to hasten the arrival of the indians who had promised to accompany us or to
          procure a gude at all events and rejoin us as soon as possible.    we sent by
          them a rifle which we offered as a reward to any of them who would engage to conduct us
          to 
          <name type="place" key="Travelers' Rest (Idaho)">traveller's rest</name>; we also
          dirrected them if they found difficulty in induciny any of them to accompany us to offer
          the reward of two other guns to be given them immediately and ten horses at the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">falls of Missouri</name>.
             we had not proceeded far this morning before 
          <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name>cut his leg very badly with one of the
          large knives; he cut one of the large veigns on the inner side of the leg; I found much
          difficulty in stoping the blood which I could not effect untill I applyed a tight
          bandage with a little cushon of wood and tow on the veign below the wound. 
          <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter's</name>horse fel with him in passing 
          <name type="place" key="Hungery Creek">hungry creek</name>and himself and horse were
          driven down the creek a considerable distance rolling over each other among the rocks.
             he fortunately escaped without injury or the loss of his gun.   
          by 1 P. M. we returned to the glade on the branch of 
          <name type="place" key="Hungery Creek">hungry Creek</name>where we had dined on the 16th
          inst.
          <ref target="n36061801" n="1"/>   here we again halted and dined.
             as there was much appearance of deer about this place we left 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R.</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">J. Feilds</name>with directions to hunt this
          evening and tomorrow morning at this place and to join us in the evening at the meadows
          of 
          <name type="place" key="Lolo (Collins's) Creek (Idaho)">Collin's creek</name>where we
          intend remaining tomorrow in order to rest our horses and hunt.    after
          dinner we proceeded on to 
          <name type="place" key="Lolo (Collins's) Creek (Idaho)">Collin's Creek</name>and
          encamped in a pleasant situation at the upper part of the meadows about 2 ms. above our
          encampment of the 15th inst.
          <ref target="n36061802" n="2"/>   we sent out several hunters but they
          returned without having killed anything.    they saw a number if salmon [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: trout</hi>]
          <ref target="n36061803" n="3"/>in the creek and shot at them several times without
          success.    we directed 
          <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>to fix each of them a gigg in the
          morning and indevour to take some of the salmon.    the hunters saw much fresh
          appearance of bear but very little of deer.    we hope by means of the fish
          together with what deer and bear we can kill to be enabled to subsist untill our guide
          arrives without the necessity of returning to the 
          <name type="place" key="Weippe Prairie (Camas Flats, Quawmash Flats)">quawmash

                  <hi rend="italic">Wednesday 18th.</hi>   The morning was cloudy and several
          showers of rain fell during the day. We started about 8 o'clock, and found the road very
          slippery and bad. Two men
          <ref target="n36061807" n="7"/>went on ahead to the village to enquire for a guide, and
          two more
          <ref target="n36061808" n="8"/>remained to look for two horses that could not be found.
          We proceeded on with four men in front to cut some bushes out of the path; but did not
          go far till one of the men
          <ref target="n36061809" n="9"/>cut himself very badly with a large knife; when we had
          to halt and bind up his wound. We again went forward, and in crossing the creek the
          horse of one of our men
          <ref target="n36061810" n="10"/>fell with him, threw him off, hurt his leg, and lost
          his blanket. We halted for dinner at the same place were we dined on the 16th and had a
          gust of rain, hail, thunder and lightening, which lasted an hour, when the weather
          cleared and we had a fine afternoon. We continued our march till we came to a small
          glade on the branch of a creek, where we encamped, and some hunters went out in the
          evening; we had left two
          <ref target="n36061811" n="11"/>men to hunt at the place where we dined. We found the
          musquitoes very troublesome on the creek, notwithstanding the snow is at so short a
          distance up the mountains. At night our hunters came to camp, having killed nothing; but
          saw some large fish
          <ref target="n36061812" n="12"/>in the creek, which they supposed were salmon.</p>
