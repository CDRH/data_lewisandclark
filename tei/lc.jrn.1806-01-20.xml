          day; the object of their visit is mearly to smoke the pipe.    on the morning

          repoted that it was all exhausted; the six lbs. have therefore lasted two days and a
          half only.    at this rate our seven Elk will last us only 3 days longer, yet
          no one seems much concerned about the state of the stores; so much for habit.
             we have latterly so frequently had our stock of provisions reduced to a
          minimum and sometimes taken a small touch of fasting that three days full allowance
          excites no concern. In those cases our skill as hunters afford us some consolation, for
          if there is any game of any discription in our neighbourhood we can track it up and kill
          it.    most of the party have become very expert with the rifle. The Indians
          who visited us today understood us sufficiently to inform us that the whites did not
          barter for the pounded fish; that it was purchased and consumed by the
