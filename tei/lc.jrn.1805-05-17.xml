Set out at an early hour, and proceeded on very well; we employed the toe line the greater part of the day; the banks were firm and shore boald which favoured the uce of the cord. I find this method of asscending the river, when the shore is such as will permit it, the safest and most expeditious mode of traveling, except with sails in a steady and favourable breze. The country rugged, the hills high, their summits and sides partially covered with pine and cedar, and the river on either side washing their bases.    it is somewhat singular that the lower part of these hills appear to be formed of a dark rich loam while the upper region about 150 feet is formed of a whiteish brown sand, so hard in many parts as to resemble stone; but little rock or stone of any kind to be seen in these hills.<ref target="n13051701" n="1"/>    the river is much narrower than usual, the bed from 200 to 300 yards only and possessing a much larger proportion of gravel than usual. a few scattering cottonwood trees are the only timber near the river; the sandbars, and with them the willow points have almost entirely disappeared.    greater appearance than usual of the saline incrustations of the banks and river hills.    we passed two creeks<ref target="n13051702" n="2"/> the one on Stard. side, and the other just below our camp on the Lard. side;<ref target="n13051703" n="3"/> each of these creeks afford a small quantity of runing water, of a brackish tast.    the great number of large beds of streams perfectly dry which we daily pass indicate a country but badly watered, which I fear is the case with the country through which we have been passing for the last fifteen or twenty days. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> walked on shore this evening and killed an Elk; buffaloe are not so abundant as they were some days past.    the party with me killed a female brown bear, she was but meagre, and appeared to have suckled young very recently. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> narrowly escaped being bitten by a rattlesnake<ref target="n13051704" n="4"/> in the course of his walk, the party killed one this evening at our encampment, which he informed me was similar to that he had seen; this snake is smaller than those common to the middle Atlantic States, being about 2 feet 6 inches long; it is of a yellowish brown colour on the back and sides, variagated with one row of oval spots of a dark brown colour lying transversely over the back from the neck to the tail, and two other rows of small circular spots of the same colour which garnis the sides along the edge of the scuta.    it's bely contains 176 scuta on the belly and 17 on the tale. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> informed me that he saw some coal which had been brought down by the water of the last creek we passed; this creek also throws out considerable quantities of Driftwood, though there is no timber on it which can be perceived from the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; we called this stream <name type="place" key="Seven Blackfoot (Burnt Lodge, Rattlesnake) Creek">rattlesnake creek</name>. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name> saw an Indian fortifyed camp this evening, which appeared to have been recently occupyed, from which we concluded it was probable that it had been formed by a war party of the <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Menetares</name> who left their vilage in March last with a view to attack the <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">blackfoot Indians</name> in consequence of their having killed some of their principal warriors the previous autumn.    we were roused late at night by the Sergt. of the guard, and warned of the danger we were in from a large tree that had taken fire and which leant immediately over our lodge.    we had the loge removed, and a few minutes after a large proportion of the top of the tree fell on the place the lodge had stood; had we been a few minutes later we should have been crushed to attoms.    the wind blew so hard, that notwithstanding the lodge was fifty paces distant from the fire it sustained considerable injury from the burning coals which were thrown on it; the party were much harrassed also by this fire which communicated to a collection of fallen timber, and could not be extinguished.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 17th.</hi>    The morning was fine and we embarked early. The hills here come very close to the river on both sides, and have very little timber on them. They are very high and much washed. There are some of them, which 
at a distance resemble ancient steeples. We passed two rivers one on each side.<ref target="n13051713" n="13"/> During the whole of this day's voyage the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name> was very handsome, and about 300 yards wide.

side.
