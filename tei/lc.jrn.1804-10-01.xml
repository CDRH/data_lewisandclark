Many of them can not be precisely identified today and conjecture beyond <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> identifications seems pointless. This list at the very least indicates the extent of intertribal trade and the importance of the <name type="native_nation" key="Arikara Indians">Arikara</name>, <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>, and <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name> villages as trading centers; these three tribes served as the middlemen of the northern <name type="place" key="Great Plains">Great Plains</name>.<lb/>
