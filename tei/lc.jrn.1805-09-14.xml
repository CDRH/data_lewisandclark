             Some places verry Steep.    came down on another fork where the
          creek
          <ref target="n22091412" n="12"/>is got to be verry large.    the Savages had
          a place fixed across the River and worked in with willows where they catch a great

          right hand fork where it was very rapid.    we proceed on    passed
          several old camps.    we followed down the main creek about 4 miles
             had nothing to eat but Some portable Soup    we being hungry for
          meat as the Soup did not Satisfy we killed a fat colt which eat verry well at this time

          mountain, on which I saw service-berry bushes hanging full of fruit; but not yet ripe,
          owing to the coldness of the climate on these mountains: I also saw a number of other
          shrubs, which bear fruit, but for which I know no names. There are black elder and
          bore-tree,
          <ref target="n22091414" n="14"/>pitch and spruce pine all growing together on these
          mountains. Being here unable to find a place to halt at, where our horses could feed, we
          went on to the junction of 
          <name type="place" key="Brushy (Quawmash, Stony) Creek (Idaho)">Stony creek</name>, with
          another large creek, which a short distance down becomes a considerable river, and
          encamped
          <ref target="n22091415" n="15"/>for the night, as it rained and was disagreeable
          travelling. The two hunters, that had gone back here joined us with 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis's</name>horse, but none of the
          hunters killed any thing except 2 or 3 pheasants; on which, without a miracle it was
          impossible to feed 30 hungry men and upwards, besides some Indians. So 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>gave out some portable
          soup,
          <ref target="n22091416" n="16"/>which he had along, to be used in cases of necessity.
          Some of the men did not relish this soup, and agreed to kill a colt; which they
          immediately did, and set about roasting it; and which appeared to me to be good eating.
          This day we travelled 17 miles.</p>

             we eat the last of our meat, and Set out as usal.    ascended a

             Some places verry Steep.    came down at another fork of the
          Creek where it was considr. larger.    the Natives had a place made across in
          form of our wires
          <ref target="n22091417" n="17"/>in 2 places, and worked in with willows verry
          injeanously, for the current verry rapid.    we crossed at the forks and
          proceeded on down the creek.    passed Several late Indian Encampments.
             our 〈Intrepter〉 Guide tells us that the natives catch a great nomber of
          Sammon along here.    we went down the creek abt. 4 miles and Camped for the
          night.    Eat a little portable Soup, but the men in jeneral So hungry that we
          killed a fine Colt which eat verry well, at this time.    we had Several light
          Showers of rain and a little hail.    Several claps of Thunder.   
          we came in all [

             Saw high mountan.
          <ref target="n22091418" n="18"/>a little to the South of us, which are covred with
          Snow.    the most of these mountains are covred with pine.    Saw

          <ref target="n22091419" n="19"/>to day.    the Soil indifferent, and verry
             broken.    the Countrey all mountaineous.    our
          hunters found a Stray horse on the road.    a Small Indian horse came to us
          this evening.</p>
               <p>Saturday Septemr 14th    A Cloudy Morning, &amp; we did not set out till we
          had breakfasted, at which we eat the last of our Meat; we then proceeded on our Journey,
          and ascended a Mountain which was cover'd with Pine timber, and was about 4 Miles from
          where it began to ascend to the top; we descended this mountain; &amp; came down to a
          Creek on a fork of it; at this place the Water run rapid, &amp; it was very full of
          Rocks.—    We ascended then, another Mountain; which was about 4 Miles from
          the fork we left to the top of it.—</p>
               <p>We continued on our way on the top of this mountain where we had a most delightful
          prospect of the Hills &amp; Vallies which lay below us, &amp; then descended this
          Mountain about 6 Miles, which in some places, we found very steep, and came down on
          another fork of the Creek, which we last left, which was considerable larger, the
          Natives had here made places across this fork of the Creek, in the form of Weirs to
          catch fish in, which we found in 2 different parts of this fork, it was worked in with
          willows very ingeniously &amp; strong, the current running very rapid at where these
          Weirs were set.—    We crossed below this place at where the Creek forked, and
          proceeded on down the creek and passed several Indian encampments, which the Natives had
          lately left.    Our guide informed us, that the Natives catch great Quantities
          of Salmon at this place, We went down this Creek about 4 Miles &amp; encamped.
             the Men here eat a little portable Soup, but still are all very hungry.—
             Our officers concluded on having a fine Colt that we had along with us
          killed, which was done, &amp; hunger made us all think that it eat delecious, We had
          towards Evening several small Showers of rain, some hail &amp; several severe Claps of
          thunder, The hunters that went after 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis's</name>horse &amp; the Colt,
          joined us in the Evening; they had found the horse only, We saw in the course of this
          days travel, several Mountains, which were covered with Snow which lay to the South of
          us.—</p>
               <p>The Tops of most of these Mountains are cover'd with pine, &amp; tall white Cedar
          Trees.    The Soil during this days travell is very indifferent, and the
          Country broken &amp; very mountaineous.    Our Hunters found a stray horse on
          the Path, &amp; a small Indian horse came to our Camp in the evening.—    We
          came about 18 Miles this day.—</p>
