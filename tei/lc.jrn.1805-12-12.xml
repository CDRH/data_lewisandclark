          In the forenoon we finished 3 rooms of our cabins, all but the covering; which I expect
          will be a difficult part of the business, as we have not yet found any timber which
          splits well; two men went out to make some boards, if possible, for our roofs. About 3
          o'clock in the afternoon a number of the natives from the seashore came to our camp,
