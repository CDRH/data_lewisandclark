               <p>A Cloudy morning Some rain, we did not Set out untill 9 oClock, haveing Changed our

          Steep assent, Shore boald and rockey Several low Islands in a Deep bend or Bay to the

          Side and at 3 miles entered a nitch of about 6 miles wide and 5 miles deep with Several
          Creeks makeing into the Stard Hills, this nitch we found verry Shallow water and Call it

          point on the Std.    here we found the Swells or waves So high that we thought
          it imprudent to proceed; we landed unloaded and drew up our Canoes. Some rain all day at
          intervales; we are all wet and disagreeable, as we have been for Several days past, and
          our present Situation a verry disagreeable one in as much; as we have not leavel land
          Sufficient for an encampment and for our baggage to lie Cleare of the tide, the High
          hills jutting in So Close and Steep that we cannot retreat back, and the water of the
          river too Salt to be used, added to this the waves are increasing to Such a hight that
          we cannot move from this place, in this Situation we are compelled to form our Camp
          between the hite of the Ebb and flood tides, and rase our baggage on logs—   
          We are not certain as yet if the whites people who trade with those people or from whome
          they precure ther goods are Stationary at the mouth, or visit this quarter at Stated

          <ref target="n25110806" n="6"/>   I believe the latter to be the most

                  <hi rend="italic">Friday 8th.</hi>   We embarked early. The morning was
          cloudy, and there was a hard wind from the east. We went about 5 miles and came to a bay
          12 or 14 miles wide. We had to coast round it, as the wind raised the waves so high we
          could go no other way. We halted and dined at a point on the north side of the bay,
          where a small river comes in.
          <ref target="n25110808" n="8"/>We again proceeded on coasting, till we came to a point
          of land where the bay becomes much narrower; and the water quite salt. The waves here
          ran so high we were obliged to lie to, and let the tide leave our canoes on dry ground.
          This point we called 
          <name type="place" key="Grays Point (Cape Swells)">Cape Swell</name>;
          <ref target="n25110809" n="9"/>and the bay above,

          depth of water. In crossing the bay when the tide was out, some of our men got sea sick,
          the swells were so great. In it there are a great many swans, geese, ducks and other
          water fowls. The whole of this day was wet and disagreeable; and the distance we made in
          a straight line, was not more than 9 miles; though the distance we coasted was above 20
          miles.</p>

               <p>Friday Novemr. 8th    This morning we had cool cloudy weather.   
          We set out on our Voyage early.    Shortly after the wind rose &amp; blew from
          the So East very hard, &amp; the River got so rough, that we were tossed very much in
          our Canoes.    We continued on our Voyage, &amp; went round a point of the
          River, &amp; entered into a Bay, or wide place about 7 Miles wide, which continued as
          far as our Eyes could descern; &amp; we expect that the River continues its width to the
          Mouth of it.    We halted about noon, at some old Indian Cabbins lying on the
          South side of the River in order to dine.    We saw vast quantities of Geese
          &amp; Swans in the bend of this River, or bay.    Our Hunters killed some
          Ducks, which they brought to us.    We continued on our Voyage, &amp; found
          the Waves running so high, that we were obliged to land about 3 o'Clock P. M, which we
          did on the South shore, &amp; took up our encampment for the Night.    Our
          party had to watch our Canoes constantly, in order to prevent them filling, the waves
          still continuing to run very high.    We found the River water at this place
          brackish.    We came 24 Miles this day.—</p>
