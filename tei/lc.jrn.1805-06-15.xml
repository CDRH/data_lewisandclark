               <p>This morning the men again were sent to bring in some more meat which 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>had killed yesterday, and
          continued the opperation of drying it. I amused myself in fishing, and sleeping away the
          fortiegues of yesterday. I caught a number of very fine trout which I made 
          <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>dry; 
          <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">goodrich</name>also caught about two douzen
          and several small 
          <ref target="n15061501" n="1">cat of a yellow colour which would weigh about 4
          lbs.</ref>   the tails was seperated with a deep angular nitch like that of
          the white cat of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">missouri</name>from which indeed they differed
          only in colour.    when I awoke from my sleep today I found a large
          rattlesnake coiled on the leaning trunk of a tree under the shade of which I had been
          lying at the distance of about ten feet from him. I killed the snake and found that he
          had 176 scuta on the abdomen and 17 half formed scuta on the tale; it was of the same
          kinde which I had frequently seen before; they do not differ in their colours from the
          rattle snake common to the middle attlantic states, but considerably in the form and
          figures of those colours. This evening after dark 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>returned and informed me
          that 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt Clark</name>had arrived with the party at
          the foot of a rappid about 5 miles below which he did not think proper to ascend and
          would wait my arrival 
          <ref target="n15061502" n="2">there.</ref>I had discovered from my journey yesterday
          that a portage on this side of the river will be attended by much difficulty in
          consequence of several deep ravines which intersect the plains [
          <hi rend="italic">NB: Qu</hi>] nearly at right angles with the river to a considerable
          distance, while the South side appears to be a delighfull smoth unbroken plain; the
          bearings of the river also make it pobable that the portage will be shorter on that side
          than on this.—    I directed 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Fields</name>to return early in the morning to 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. C.</name>and request him to send up a
          party of men for the dryed meat which we had made. I finde a very heavy due on the grass
          about my camp every morning which no doubt procedes from the mist of the falls, as it
          takes place no where in the plains nor on the 〈hills〉 river except here.</p>

          rapids where the waves came over the Canoe which I was in and I expected everry moment
          to have filled.—.    in the evening we came to a bad rapid which we concluded
          to camp below it all night as we would be too late gitting through—   So we
          Camped on the Stard. Side.    one man

          to be a good deal of small cotton-wood on the banks of this creek. In the afternoon we
          passed red bluffs on both sides of the river, and at night came to a large rapid which
          we did not venture to pass so late; and therefore encamped below on the north side,
