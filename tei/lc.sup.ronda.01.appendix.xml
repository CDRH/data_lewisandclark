               <p>Readers of this book will undoubtedly wonder why the most famous Indian associated
          with the 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>expedition is mentioned so
          infrequently. Over the past century a powerful mythology has grown up, making
          extravagant claims for 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>as expedition guide and American
          heroine. Writers from Eva Emery Dye and Grace R. Hebard to Donald Culross Peattie and
          Anna Lee Waldo have fashioned narratives that go far beyond what can be known from
          reputable historical sources. When evidence runs thin, many writers have been all too
          willing to pass off fabrication for fact. Thus the claims still persist that 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>single-handedly guided the
          expedition through unknown lands to the 
          <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>and that she died an old woman at 
          <name type="place" key="Wind River (Wyo.)">Wind River</name>, 
          <name type="place" key="Wyoming">Wyoming</name>in 1884. Such myths diminish 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>and make a balanced evaluation of
          her genuine contributions more difficult. More important, they draw our attention away
          from those native men and women who made more fundamental contributions to the
          expedition's success.</p>
               <p>What is reliably known about 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>makes for only a brief biographical
          sketch. Sometime in the fall of 1800, the young

          attacked by

          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was already pregnant and on February
          11, 1805, she gave birth to a son named

          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Toussaint Charbonneau</name>was finally
          hired by 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>as an interpreter, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>and her chid became part of the
          Corps of Discovery.</p>
               <p>Three questions about 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>have long fascinated 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>scholars. The name of the Indian
          woman—its meaning and proper spelling—continues to spark considerable debate. 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacajawea</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, and 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sakakawea</name>have all had their partisans. The
          concern about spelling is not just a quibble over orthography. If the woman's name was 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacajawea</name>, the word might be 
          <ref target="http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/images_Shoshoni.html"
                       rend="box">
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name>
                  </ref>, meaning "boat launcher." However, if the spelling is more properly 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, the name would be 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>and translate as "Bird
          Woman." The journal evidence from 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>appears as to support a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>derivation. On May 20,
          1805, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>wrote: "
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sah cagah we ah</name>or 
          <name type="place" key="Sacagawea River">bird woman's River</name>" to name what is now 
          <name type="place" key="Sacagawea River">Crooked Creek</name>in north-central 
          <name type="place" key="Montana">Montana</name>. The most effective arguments for a 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>spelling and a 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Hidatsa Indians">Hidatsa</name>meaning are offered by
          Irving Anderson in his "
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacajawea</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sakakawea</name>?" (
          <hi rend="italic">South Dakota History</hi>8 [1978]:303–11). Anderson summarizes the
          previous literature and finds that the 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>spelling best fits both the
          historical and linguistic evidence. However, it should be noted that an unpublished
          paper by Bob Saindon, "'
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacajawea</name>': The Origin and Meaning of a
          Name," does raise important questions about the whole matter. Both Anderson and Saindon
          rely heavily on the findings of professional linguists, who in turn differ considerably
          in their conclusions. Along with the historian Donald Jackson, I have found the 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>spelling most acceptable.</p>
               <p>Far more important than the spelling and meaning of 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name>name is the nature and scope of
          her contributions to the expedition. Perhaps the most persistent 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>myth is that 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>"guided" the party to the 
          <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>. In countless statues, poems,
          paintings, and books she is depicted as a westward-pointing pathfinder providing
          invaluable direction for bewildered explorers. In the interest of correction, there has
          been a tendency to underestimate 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name>genuine achievements as a member
          of the Corps of Discovery. Not as important as 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>or 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name>, the young woman did make
          significant contributions to the expedition's success.</p>
               <p>Those contributions can be discussed under four heads. When the expedition left 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Mandan (N. Dak.)">Fort Mandan</name>in April 1805, its most
          immediate need was to find the

                  </ref>Indians and obtain horses for what was assumed would be an easy mountain portage
          to 
          <name type="place" key="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</name>waters. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>certainly believed that 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>would be of considerable value in
          the

                  </ref>mission. They expected that she might recognize landmarks along the route and
          would provide general information about the location of

                  </ref>camps. When 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>became ill at the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">Great Falls of the
          Missouri</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>admitted, "This gave me some

          as from the consideration of her being our only dependence for friendly negocition with
          the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake Indians</name>."
          <ref target="n1101" n="1"/>But just what the captains expected from her in those talks
          is not plain. For reasons that are now unclear, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was not included in 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis's</name>advance party that finally

                  </ref>in August 1805. Good relations between the explorers and 
          <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name>depended far more on promises of
          guns and trades than on any intercessions made by 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was not an expedition guide in the
          usual sense of the word. When 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>needed to make a critical decision
          in early June 1805 about the true channel of the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>, she took no part in the
          process. Much later, when the expedition needed guides, men like 
          <name type="person" key="Old Toby">Old Toby</name>, 
          <name type="person" key="Tetoharsky">Tetoharsky</name>, and 
          <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair (Walamotinin)">Twisted Hair</name>were hired for
          that duty. Only twice did 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>provide what might be termed guide
          services. In late July and early August 1805, she recognized important geographical
          features on the way to find

          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>accompanied 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>party and provided the explorer
          with valuable information on what has since been named 
          <name type="place" key="Bozeman Pass">Bozeman Pass</name>. For most of the
          transcontinental journey, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was seeing country as new to her as
          it was to the captains. That she was not in the lead making trail decisions does not
          diminish the fact that when she did recognize a landmark, "this piece of information
          cheered the spirits of the party."

               </p>
               <p>Success in many of the expedition's Indian missions depended on reliable
          communication and translation. Both diplomacy and the collection of ethnographic
          information demanded the sort of communication that 
          <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard's</name>signs could not
          always provide. One of 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name>most important roles in the
          expedition was that of translator, or as 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>quaintly put it, "interpretress
          with the 
          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake Indians</name>." She often
          worked as part of a long and cumbersome translation chain that took each native word
          through many speakers before reaching the captains.

               <p>The expedition also benefited from the physical presence of

          have thought the explorers part of a war party were evidently reassured when they saw a
          woman and an infant in the group. 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>said as much when he wrote, "The

               <p>If 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name>life and accomplishments have been
          hotly debated, controversy has also swirled around the date and place of her death. When
          Grace R. Hebard published her 
          <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacajawea</name>
                  </hi>in 1933, she claimed that the Indian woman had lived at 
          <name type="place" key="Wind River (Wyo.)">Wind River</name>, 
          <name type="place" key="Wyoming">Wyoming</name>, under the name Porivo until her death
          in 1884. As Irving Anderson points out in his closely argued "Probing the Riddle of the
          Bird Woman" (
          <hi rend="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</hi>23 [1973]: 2–17),
          Hebard's book misinterpreted some evidence and neglected much more. Statements by 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>and trader John C. Luttig
          make it plain that 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>died on December 20, 1812, at 
          <name type="place" key="Fort Manuel (S. Dak.)">Fort Manuel</name>in present-day 
          <name type="place" key="South Dakota">South Dakota</name>. Most scholars now accept 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>note in his Cash Book that 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>was dead by the 1825–28 period and
          Luttig's note—"this Evening the wife of

          <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Snake</name>Squaw, died of a putrid
          fever she was a good and the best woman in the fort, aged abt 25 years"—as substantial
          evidence for 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea's</name>early death.</p>
               <p>From the time of the expedition itself, 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>has prompted strong opinions. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>themselves wrote quite different
          evaluations of the woman and her place in expedition history. 
          <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Lewis</name>, evidently unimpressed with
          her, declared, "If she has enough to eat and a few trinkets I beleive she would be
          perfectly content anywhere."

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>did not share what seems the
          ill-concealed contempt in those lines. He wrote to

          journey was over, "Your woman who accompanied you that long dangerous and fatigueing

               <p>Readers in search of a balanced treatment of 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>might begin with Irving Anderson,
          "Probing the Riddle of the Bird Woman," 
          <hi rend="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</hi>23 (1973): 2–17, and E.

          <hi rend="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western History</hi>26 (1976): 18–29. Also of
          considerable value are Irving Anderson, "A 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbonneau</name>Family Portrait," 
          <hi rend="italic">American West</hi>17 (1980): 4–13, 63–64; C. S. Kingston, "
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacajawea</name>as a Guide—The Evaluation of a
          Legend," 
          <hi rend="italic">Pacific Northwest Quarterly</hi>35 (1944): 2–18; Blanche Schroer,
          "Boat-Pusher or Bird-Woman? 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>or

          <hi rend="italic">Annals of Wyoming</hi>52 (1980): 46–54. The best book-length treatment
          is Harold P. Howard, 
          <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979) must be read with caution since it
          uncritically accepts the notion of a 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>who lived into the 1880s. Recent
          novels about 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, including Anna Lee Waldo, 
          <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi>(New York: Avon Books, 1979) must be read as fiction, not history. Their claims to
          historical accuracy are dubious at best and misleading at worst.</p>
