          are verry poor, we have neither powder, Ball or knifves, nor the women at the village
          has no Cloaths nor our children to war [wear] and wishes that my fathers Sons would be
          charitable enofe to Give them Some things, as his Brothers gave him a fine Suit of
          cloaths with a flag, and a Meaddel, or Gave him permission to Stop the first trading
          boat or pearogue that would come up the river to trade with them &amp;-c—   
          &amp; he Said he would make peace with or between the

          would bring chiefs from each nation to the Seat of Government next Spring with him &amp;
          his chiefs, and that his Situation was Such that he could not leave his nation to go
          before Spring; and he Said if he Spoke to them it would be better than it would for his
          Great fathers Sons, for they would hear him better, he Said likewise that he went to the
          English &amp; they gave him a Meddal &amp; cloaths &amp; but when he went to the Spanish
          they never Gave him any thing to keep the meddal from his Skin, he Says that now you
          gave me a meddal &amp; cloaths but we are poor as the trader did not come to bring us
          goods for Some time I wish you would consider &amp; give me Something for our Squaws at
          home my Brothers,—    the Captains told them that they were not traders, that
          they had only come to make the road open for the traders to come &amp; that in a Short

               <p>On linguistic grounds, the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Dakotas</name>may be classified in three
        regional divisions from east to west:

        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name>.</p>
               <p>Throughout the eighteenth century the 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name>, 
        <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yanktons</name>, and

        <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name>time the

        on both sides of the 
        <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>; by mid-century they had moved
        almost entirely west of the river and had themselves subdivided into seven named
        groups.</p>
               <p>The group names recorded by

        Certain group names transferred throughout historic times from one
