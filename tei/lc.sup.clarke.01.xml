               <lb/> Introduction to the Bison Books Edition</head>
            <p>A few years ago I was helping my friend Stephen Ambrose lead a group of people along
               some of the most scenic stretches of the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Trail. On a warm summer evening, after a
               pleasant day of paddling canoes on the Missouri River, we camped amid the eerie and
               majestic White Cliffs of north-central Montana, close to the exact spot where, or 31
               May 1805, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</name> wrote
               one of his most lyrical journal passages about the wondrous landscape he and his men
               were encountering with such fresh eyes. "As we passed on," Lewis concluded, "it
               seemed as if those seens of visionary inchantment would never have an end."</p>
            <p>Nearly two centuries later we found the enchantment equally palpable as we sat around
               the campfire and gazed at the silent cliffs reflected in the river, tinged pink by
               the setting sun. There were about thirty of us in the group, roughly the same number
               as in the original Corps of Discovery. Beyond that one feature of our trip–and
               our geographical location–most of the similarities between the two expeditions
               ended. On average our group's members were about thirty years older than the young
               men under the command of Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> (along with one teenaged Indian woman and her infant son). We had
               paddled <hi rend="italic">down</hi>stream to our camp (which was tiring enough for
               people our age), but nothing we did could be compared to dragging bulky dugouts day
               in and day out against the Missouri's relentless current. Unlike the Corps of
               Discovery, we felt no concerns about grizzly bears (they disappeared from the river a
               century ago), getting lost (we had precise maps and an experienced outfitter), or
               finding horses when the canoe portion of our journey ended (a chartered bus was hired
               to take us back to our parked cars). Having studied the history of the expedition in
               some detail, we also had made sure of another important difference: unlike the Corps
               of Discovery, we were absolutely <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to run out of
               whiskey.</p>
            <p>That evening, after Steve and I took turns reading aloud from the journals, he spoke
               for a few minutes about teamwork. It's a point he had eloquently made three years
               earlier in the documentary film Ken Burns and I produced for public television: how
               after so many days together in their struggle to cross the continent, members of the
               Corps of Discovery eventually became so close to one another that they could hear a
               cough in the night and know who it was; they could recognize the sound of each
               other's footsteps; they knew who was best at hunting, at starting a fire, or at any
               other task; they even knew who liked salt on his meat and who didn't. Such detailed
               knowledge about everyone else's personal habits and strengths—a simultaneous
               acknowledgment of individuality within a group that itself has begun to act as a
               single, organic unit—is the natural byproduct of the intimate bond of teamwork
               so crucial to the success of any expedition.</p>
            <p>Everyone around the campfire nodded in agreement, then headed for their sleeping
               bags. The next morning I told Steve he could add another item of familiarity to his
               list. After only one night of camping together, I said, we already knew who snored
               and who didn't—and we would be pitching our tents accordingly for the remainder
               of the trip.</p>
            <p>Did any members of the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expedition snore? If so, which ones? Was it a gentle sawing sound
               that encouraged the others to sleep, like the croaking of frogs on a riverbank? Or
               was it a series of erratically erupting snorts and rasps, perhaps even a grand anvil
               chorus of a dozen or more men that reverberated out of the tents, echoed over the
               hills, and alarmed the wild beasts of the Plains? Did their non-snoring campmates
               ponder (as that other great American adventurer Huckleberry Finn would have) the
               age-old conundrum, the "curiosest thing in the world": why is the snorer, the person
               closest to the sound, the only one left undisturbed by his snoring? Did they kick or
               shove or toss sticks at the offender? Or did they simply lie there, wide awake and
               murderously sleep deprived, silently calculating how hard it would be to slip a few
               doses of Rush's Thunderbolts (that super-powered laxative) into someone's
               breakfast?</p>
            <p>We don't know the answers to these questions because the primary source of
               information, the expedition's journals, doesn't provide them. But it's a safe bet
               that every single member of the Corps of Discovery could have answered them, and
               probably in elaborate detail.</p>
            <p>The men considered some specific disruptions of their slumber important enough to
               mention in their journals. The night before the expedition entered the White Cliffs,
               for instance, a buffalo bull stampeded into the sleeping camp, rampaged around the
               four fires, bent a rifle and one of the blunderbusses with its pounding hooves, and,
               according to <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sgt. John Ordway</name>, came
               "within a flew Inches of Several mens heads" before Lewis's dog, <name type="person" key="Seaman">Seaman</name>, chased it away. "It was Supposed," <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> added, that "if he had trod on a man it would
               have killed him dead."' This puts the issue of being awakened by snoring in a
               different perspective. Or consider the night of 26 July 1806, on the Corps's return
               trip, when a vicious wolf sank its fangs into the hand of Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Nathaniel Pryor</name> the kind of disturbance that
               might rouse anyone from even the deepest of dreams.</p>
            <p>Both captains reported times when the worries of leadership prevented them from
               sleeping: <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>, when the
               entire crew was required to spend the night on their keelboat, surrounded by hundreds
               of <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name> warriors;
               Lewis, when he camped near Lemhi Pass with a band of <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>s, whom he feared were about to abandon him
               before he could purchase any of their desperately needed horses. <name type="person" key="Seaman">Seaman</name> the dog had his own share of what Lewis called
               "wristless nights"–constantly patrolling the campsites after dark in bear
               country to warn the men of approaching grizzlies, as if the responsibility to allow
               others some wellearned rest was his alone.</p>
            <p>Most other recorded bouts with insomnia, though far less dramatic, are nonetheless
               helpful in providing a fuller picture of the expedition's experience. At a site west
               of the Yellowstone River the beaver were so numerous that the slapping of their tails
               on the water kept some men from nodding off; near the mouth of the Columbia the huge
               and noisy flocks of geese and brants had done the same thing. Along the Missouri
               mosquitoes caused at least two sleepless nights (and probably innumerable others
               unrecorded); fleas were the problem at Fort Clatsop. Among the Nez Percés in Idaho,
               after the nearly starved men had unadvisedly gorged themselves on salmon and camas
               root, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> dutifully noted in his
               journal that the feast "filled us so full of wind, that we were scercely able to
               Breathe all night" (and then, thankfully, he left additional details of the evening
               to the imagination).</p>
            <p>But nowhere in the journals–among the hundreds of thousands of words that
               chronicle every day of the historic two-and-a-half-year expedition that brim with a
               remarkable accumulation of information—do we learn who among the Corps of
               Discovery snored his way across the continent and back.</p>
            <p>Obviously the issues of sleep and snoring are not the most critical points of
               consideration in the epic journey of Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and their fellow explorers. But they do lead to
               larger, more important ones.</p>
            <p>First, despite the incredible wealth of detail in the expedition's journals, much
               went unrecorded for posterity. (This is not so much a complaint as an observation.)
               Embarked as they were on an arduous trek into unmapped territory, where every bend in
               the river and every new horizon might spell discouragement, disaster, or defeat, the
               insistent priorities of mere survival could easily have overwhelmed the more prosaic
               task of taking pen to paper every evening. That they wrote at all—let alone
               created such an enduring classic among the annals of exploration—stands as a
               stunning achievement in itself, a testament both to <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>'s farsighted instructions that
               "your observations are to be taken with great pains &amp; accuracy, to be entered
               distinctly &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself," and to their diligence
               in carrying out those orders, even in the most difficult situations.</p>
            <p>Journals from six men have survived: those of Captains Meriwether Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>, Sergeants <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name>, <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>, and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd</name>, and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Private Joseph Whitehouse</name>. Taken together their
               commentaries leave no day of the expedition unrecorded, and for most days provide
               multiple perspectives from which to triangulate events. In addition, Sergeant <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Private Robert Frazer</name> are presumed to have kept
               journals as well, as yet unrecovered. What has been lost from not hearing their
               voices? How much more would we learn from the personal accounts of others on the
               expedition, such as <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s black slave; or <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, the young <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name> woman, and Charbonneau, her French Canadian
               husband; or the other enlisted men? It's impossible to tell.</p>
            <p>This leads to a second issue: the nature of the journals themselves. These are not
               the diaries of teenage girls, full of emotion and juicy gossip, meant as an outlet
               for personal feelings and destined to be kept under lock and key for fear of
               embarrassment. Nor are they the journals of mature adults as we might expect them to
               be written today, recording a day's activities as a springboard for someone's
               innermost thoughts and contemplations. These are the journals of busy military men
               writing under orders from the president of the United States, recording information
               meant to be useful to him and the rest of the "civilized world," and fully
               anticipating that what they set down would be published in some form or another. In
               other words, the more personal the informationfrom the trivial (naming names about
               snoring habits) to the profound (private desires and misgivings, or frank assessments
               of another expedition member's strengths and weaknesses)—the less likely the
               Corps of Discovery's chroniclers are to reveal it.</p>
            <p>On a few occasions Lewis displays a histrionic yearning for glory or alternately
               provides brief glimpses into the darker recesses of his soul. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> sometimes whines about his health or exhibits a
               fatherly concern for the welfare of his men. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s descriptions of the most dangerous moments come the closest to
               expressing outright fear, just as his entries about Christmas and his longing to
               return home seem the most heartfelt. In general, though, the information the journals
               provide exists within a fairly narrow range: miles traveled, the day's weather,
               locations of campsites, new species and new landscapes encountered, Indian tribes met
               and the prospects for trade, brief accountings of the day's highlights, and soon. All
               the things, in other words, that Mr. <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> so anxiously awaited. He wasn't interested in reading a novel of
               western adventure, he wanted facts. The Corps of Discovery obeyed by returning with a
               prodigious number of them.</p>
            <p>If <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> had added in his
               instructions to "Take equal pains to tell us more about yourselves and your traveling
               companions, your own habits, beliefs, and customs, &amp;c.," the journalists might
               possibly have taken a soldierly stab at it–though it is as difficult to imagine
               them doing so with much enthusiasm as it is to imagine the shy and secretive
               president wanting that kind of information in the first place. His priorities were
               clear: he wanted facts, not story.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, from the unelaborated facts alone a dramatic narrative emerges, one
               that is chock full of more heart-pounding near misses than most novels of the day
               would have dared attempt: a crumbling riverbank nearly overwhelms the keelboat; Lewis
               nearly falls to his death from a cliff; a confrontation with the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
               <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> nearly turns deadly for
               both sides; men nearly freeze to death on the northern Plains; buffaloes nearly
               trample them and grizzly bears nearly catch them; a pirogue containing the most
               valuable cargo nearly capsizes; the expedition nearly takes a disastrous turn up the
               wrong river; a violent hailstorm nearly kills some of the men, while a flash flood
               nearly sweeps <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> to his death;
                  <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> nearly dies from sickness;
               her people, the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name>s
               (with their all-important horses), nearly abandon Lewis; while crossing the
               Bitterroot Range, nearly lost, everyone nearly starves; the Nez Percés nearly
               decide to kill rather than befriend the weak and starving strangers; Columbia River
               cascades and then ocean swells nearly swamp the small flotilla of dugout canoes;
               Blackfeet warriors nearly leave Lewis and a few companions horseless and gunless in
               hostile territory;, Lewis is shot and nearly killed in a hunting accident. (And,
               unbeknownst to the expedition, Spanish war parties dispatched for their destruction
               nearly intercept them.)</p>
            <p>Just as facts overshadow feelings and personalities in the journals, the repetitive
               drumbeat of dramatic moments eventually drowns out the details of the more mundane
               day-to-day routines and the quiet heroics of getting up each morning for yet another
               exhausting day of moving only a few miles more across a seemingly endless continent.
               What is captured in the bargain is undoubtedly the most important information, as
               well as the most stirring moments. But what is lost is a fuller sense of the
               participants in this historic event, and perhaps some greater insights the
               participants in this historic event, and perhaps some greater insights into how they
               succeeded so spectacularly. It's like reading an intricately plotted, action-packed,
               and highly informative novel that is sadly populated by rather featureless
               characters, or embarking on an epic adventure without really getting to know everyone
               else along on the trip.</p>
            <p>Exacerbating the problem with all this lost potential is the way in which the
               captains overshadow everyone else. From the very start the historic enterprise tended
               to be viewed from the top down. President <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, for instance, always considered it the "Lewis Expedition,"
               reflecting his notion that Lewis was the only one to whom he had delegated authority
               and who therefore was solely responsible for the journey's outcome. Lewis knew
               better. He was the first to add <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
               to the expedition's name, and always insisted that his trusted friend shared in the
               fame (just as he had shared in the decision making throughout the hard journey). So
               successful were these two remarkable leaders at melding their talents that they now
               seem historically joined at the hip, two quite different men who cast an even larger
               shadow because they stand together. They are unquestionably the "stars" of the story
               and the ones we most easily recognize, not only because they were the leaders but
               also because they are the story's principal narrators. Despite the existence of other
               journals, we turn to the captains' version of events first.</p>
            <p>From time to time in the story a few other members of the expedition threaten to
               emerge as personalities in their own right, however fleetingly. The lavish attentions
               and honor which Indians paid to <name type="person" key="York">York</name> because of
               his black skin prompt the journalists to take note of it, too, although for most of
               the expedition his presence–and its social ramifications–goes unremarked.
               Did some of the men (many from slave-holding states) resent those attentions? Did any
               consider him their friend and equal? What were <name type="person" key="York">York</name>'s thoughts? As they all paddled furiously down the Missouri toward
               home in 1806, did he expect that whatever newly found freedoms he had gained from the
               journey (if indeed any were gained) would be extended to him once they reached St.
               Louis?</p>
            <p>Similar questions could be asked–and left unanswered–about <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, the only woman, mother, and
               full-blood Indian on the expedition. She figures prominently in some of the more
               dramatic moments (such as the near capsizing of the white pirogue and, of course, the
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshone</name> negotiations
               with a chief who miraculously turns out to be her brother), and we get a few hints at
               her character (such as when she insists on being taken to see the beached whale on
               the Oregon coast, or when she presents <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> with a Christmas present of two dozen white weasel tails). But she
               is absent from the recorded story as often as she is in it, and her point of view is
               available only through speculation.</p>
            <p>What <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and <name type="person" key="York">York</name> have in common–and, to a lesser extent, what
               Charbonneau, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name> (a
               mixed-blood of French and Shawnee descent), the baby Jean Baptiste, and even what the
               dog, <name type="person" key="Seaman">Seaman</name>, also share–is what sets
               them apart from those we call simply "the men." That's merely another way of saying
               "everyone else." While these few stand out as individual characters in the saga, most
               often "the men" come across as an undifferentiated whole, a single unit comprised of
               interchangeable parts rather than a collection of individuals, each one with his own
               distinct personality, his own foibles and strengths, his own role to play, his own
               unique perspective on the larger experience. History has tended to lump them all
               together as "the men" and left it at that.</p>
            <p>Clearly <hi rend="italic">they</hi> didn't see it that way. As military men they
               recognized the authority and leadership of their captains and no doubt accepted the
               enterprise as the "Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
               Expedition." But as human beings (and, equally pertinent, as Americans in the first
               generation of independence), each man surely considered it his expedition–in
               experience if not in name. "The men" were individuals with individual names,
               individual attributes, and individual stories to tell.</p>
            <p>Charles <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Men of the Lewis &amp; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
                  Expedition</hi>, first published in 1970, was one of the first to remind the world
               of that selfevident but too-often-overlooked fact. As he wrote in his introduction,
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke</name>'s purpose was to "bring
               these men into being again and to rescue them from oblivion so far as is possible at
               this late date." <hi rend="italic">So far as is possible at this late date</hi>.
               Unfortunately, for the many reasons mentioned–the missing voices, the
               circumscribed nature of the journals' focus, the dominance of the captains (and a few
               others) as individual characters–what is "possible at this late date" carries
               special weight and places severe constraints on a noble (and eloquently stated) goal.
               If "the men" have not exactly been fully brought back into being again in these
               pages, the reason is a simple lack of documentary raw material.</p>
            <p>But they can be rescued from complete oblivion. By providing biographical sketches of
               fifty-one expedition members and then arranging a synopsis of each day's events with
               an emphasis on those things directly relating to each of the members, Charles <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clarke</name> performed a valuable service. One
               by one "the men" struggle to emerge as the individuals they surely must have been.
               Yet the facts–or, more precisely, the lack of enough facts–constantly
               limit their complete resuscitation. Enough exists to reassemble a skeleton and
               perhaps a bit of flesh, but, <hi rend="italic">so far as is possible at this late
                  date</hi>, breathing real life and blood into them is now probably best left to
               historical novelists. As for the rest of us, we can string together the available
               facts about an individual expedition member to hint at a fuller portrait and, with a
               little imagination, at least point ourselves toward a fuller understanding of what it
               must have been like to be a member of the greatest expedition in American history. </p>
            <p>Consider, for instance, one of my personal favorites, Alexander Hamilton <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>, one of the many men about
               whom there is more that we don't know than what we do know. Born along the
               Connecticut River in Charlestown, New Hampshire (just a few miles from my home),
                  <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> was twenty-five years
               old, apparently a skilled blacksmith, and a private in the army when he joined the
               Corps of Discovery at its camp in Illinois during the winter of 1803–1804. What
               prompted <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> to volunteer for
               the expedition? How did he fit in with the other young men who tended toward
               rabble-rousing that first winter? What did he expect for the journey? (Fevered
               excitement? foreboding? feigned ambivalence?) These are all unknown. Aside from a few
               passing references–a jumbled list of recruits, a notation of who got drunk on
               New Year's Eve, the mention of bringing in a pair of hinges–<name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s name rarely appears in the early months
               of the journals.</p>
            <p>As the expedition began its ascent up the Missouri, it appears <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> spent at least some days on shore riding
               horseback with George <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>,
               the expedition's chief scout and best hunter, which suggests that the captains
               recognized in him some level of competence with a gun and horses. Someone raised
               along the Connecticut would have been familiar with rivers, but the mighty Missouri's
               size, power, and soon-to- be-legendary treachery must have amazed <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>. Perhaps he was thankful to be assigned to
               hunting duty rather than fighting the Big Muddy with the others. Did he and <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> exchange stories from
               their very different backgrounds? Was there an implicit competition between them over
               who supplied the most fresh meat to the hungry men? Did the primeval hardwood forests
               of Missouri, with their majestic stands of hickory and oak, hearken him back to the
               gentle hills of New Hampshire, blanketed with trees as they might have been when
                  <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s ancestors first
               arrived in New England? We can speculate but we cannot know. The journals only report
               for certain that he and <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> were responsible for the horses in late May, that on at least
               one occasion he and other hunters killed three fat elk bulls, and that, in the
               organization of the party, he was assigned to the squad of <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant Ordway</name>, a fellow New Hampshire native. It takes
               a careful reading of the early journals to be even aware of <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s presence.</p>
            <p>But on 12 July 1804, at Camp New Island, just north of what is now the
               Kansas-Nebraska line, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>
               burst onto center stage in the expedition's narrative. He did it, ironically enough,
               by sleeping. During the first months of the expedition the captains had worked to
               instill military discipline on a group of young men who seem to have been
               particularly reluctant to accept it. There were cases of drunkenness (<name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s had been but one of many
               such infractions), open disobedience, men going AWOL, and night guards helping
               themselves to supplies (that is, the whiskey). In each case Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> had convened a court-martial of
               enlisted men to hear the charges, judge the facts, and mete out punishments, usually
               consisting of fifty lashes.</p>
            <p>On 12 July, however, the captains themselves composed the courtmartial because of the
               seriousness of the offense: falling asleep while on night guard duty, the kind of
               lapse that might endanger the entire expedition's survival in the wrong circumstance
               and obviously something Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> wanted to make sure never happened again. The few facts we know of
               the incident are confined to the four terse paragraphs Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> entered in the expedition's orderly book: <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> had been assigned as night
               sentinel the previous evening; his sergeant, <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, accused him of "lying down and Sleeping on his post"; the offense
               was considered "<hi rend="italic">Capatol Crimes</hi>, and under the rules and
               articles of <hi rend="italic">War</hi> punishable by <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>."
               Acting in his own defense, the report says, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> made what I would consider to be the first
               attempt at a plea bargain west of the Mississippi River: "<hi rend="italic">Guilty of
                  Lying Down, and not Guilty of Going to Sleep</hi>."</p>
            <p>Whether he had actually been asleep a few hours earlier (as charged) or not (as he
               claimed), <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> must surely
               have been fully alert during these proceedings. His life potentially hung in the
               balance as the captains weighed their decision and then announced it: guilty of both
               charges. An extra jolt of adrenaline must have rushed through his system in the brief
               moment between verdict and sentencing: not execution (obvious relief) but one hundred
               lashes on the bare back (a quick, reflexive tensing of shoulder muscles) to be
               administered in equal amounts over four nights.</p>
            <p>It would be interesting–and informative–to know the other men's reaction
               to the trial, the verdict, and the next four evenings at each successive campsite,
               when <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> would have stepped
               forward to strip down his shirt and turn his face away to receive his nightly dose of
               twenty-five lashes. Perhaps some of the men, by now friends since spending seven
               months together, turned their faces away too. Maybe others relished the sight,
               harboring either some personal grudge against <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> or a belief that he truly had endangered
               their survival and deserved a stricter punishment. Once again the journals are of no
               help in creating a complete sense of the event. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>, and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> make
               no mention whatsoever of the court martial, let alone the nightly lashings. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> devotes only a single sentence to
               the incident ("one Sentinel a Sleep on his post last night, and tried by court
               martial this day"), omitting not only that <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> was the accused but that <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> himself was the accuser. Is the
               near silence about the matter in the enlisted men's diaries significant? It's
               impossible to say.</p>
            <p>Equally lost to history is <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s point of view. If wrongly accused he could have been justifiably
               resentful toward his sergeant and commanding officers; if caught "fair and square" he
               might have considered himself properly chastised, perhaps even lucky to have escaped
               with whatever skin was left on his back at the end of the fourth evening. Did Lewis
               (the chief dispenser of medicine) treat <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s wounds each night? Did the floggings leave lasting scars? Was
                  <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> comforted or shunned
               by his mates during the next few days? Was he brought back into the company of men
               with, perhaps, a few jokes, a friendly word, a helping hand during a task made
               difficult by a sore back? Answers to those questions would explain much about the
               dynamics of the Corps of Discovery–between the commanders and their men,
               between noncommissioned officers and their squads, within the group as a whole, or
               between individual members–but we could answer them only if we had more
               details. Instead we are left to wonder, extrapolate, speculate, yearn for fuller
               information, and, in the end, be thankful for the few facts we do have from which to
               populate this epic expedition with more than simply names on a list.</p>
            <p>We know with certainty that July 1804 was not a good month for Private <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>, because he surfaces next in
               the joumals on 29 July when he was dispatched back to the previous night's campsite
               to retrieve a tomahawk he had forgotten, and then, while crossing a creek on a log,
               had lost his balance and dropped his rifle into the deep water. We know also that
                  <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name> was sent out to rescue
               the gun from the creek's muddy bottom. <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> probably never forgot that humiliating day: the look in the
               captains' eyes or the sounds of their voices after he admitted to misplacing his
               tomahawk; the long walk to retrieve it; the moment on the log when he thought he
               would fall in, and the next moment, right after dropping his rifle, when he probably
               wished he had; the sight of <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben
                  Field</name> disappearing underwater and his reappearance moments later with the
               prize; the talk and the looks of the other men when he and his sodden companion
               returned to camp and retold the story; the sinking feeling that perhaps he shouldn't
               have volunteered for the expedition in the first place. Regardless of how memorable
               that day was for <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>, the
               journals' mention of his part in it slides by in a few short sentences. We are told
               more about the weather (dark with occasional rain, cold wind from the WNW, the state
               of the river (more bends and slower current north of the Platte, the banks lined
               mostly with cottonwoods now, many of them ravaged and broken by a storm of sometime
               in the recent past), and the day's provisions (some huge catfish and jerked meat from
                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>'s fresh kills) than
               we are told about any particular person.</p>
            <p>And so it goes for the remainder of the "<name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> Expedition." For the rest of the journey he sporadically appears
               in tantalizing shards of information—the DNA of a fuller story, suggesting (but
               only suggesting) the unique quality of one man's unforgettable experience—and
               through him a better knowledge of the larger organism known as the Corps of
               Discovery. He appears, then just as quickly disappears, leaving us to fill in the
               blanks or connect the dots.<lb/> And what dots there are to connect!</p>

                  and marches off with everyone else. Late in the afternoon <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> finalty catches up with the expedition,
                  without the horse.</item>

                  from the salt works on the seashore with a serious injury. While butchering some

                  reported sick: "a high fever and complains of the pain in his head and want of
                  appetite," writes Lewis, who treats him with "Scott's pills" the next day. On 27
                  February he is still reported as "very unwell;" on 8 March he is "yet complaining
                  and is low Spirited;" on 20 March, "remain[s] weak;" and on 21 March still does
                  "not seem to recover" and now taken by a "violent pain in his leg and thye." Not
                  until 29 March, nearly a week after the expedition has departed for home from Fort
                  Clatsop, is <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> considered

                  once more become one of the regular hunters, he and <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> kill two deer and a large grizzly (revenge
                  from the near-death experience of a year earlier?) and set out in their canoe to
                  catch up with the others. Darkness falls but they decide to continue down the

                  Somehow he grabs two small logs, ties them together, places his clothes on them,

                  midnight a violent thunderstorm erupts, whipping up such ferocious winds and waves
                  that the men are ordered to hold onto the canoes to prevent them from being blown
                  off the sandbar where the expedition is encamped. Two canoes that had been lashed

                  hang on for dear life–and are blown across the river. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and six men set out in the small pirogue to

            <p>With that notation <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> exits
               from the journals forever. What a pity because, as this brief outline suggests, <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Private Alexander Hamilton <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>
               </hi> would have been an epic in itself,
               if only he could be brought back to life to tell it in detail from his own point of
               view. Part <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>, complete with valuable lessons
               learned on the road, and part <hi rend="italic">Perils of Pauline</hi>, full of close
               calls and comic mishaps, it would also add immeasurable depth to the larger story of
               the Corps of Discovery. If fully fleshed out, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s tale–of a lowly and sometimes
               hapless private who suffered lashings, injuries, illnesses, and accidents, yet
               persevered to earn his commanders' trust and his nation's thanks–would humanize
               the expedition in a way that the existing accounts never will.</p>
            <p>Lacking that, the mere outline of <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s journey (and of everyone else's brought forth in this book) at
               the very least demands that we resist the temptation to think of "the men" of the
               Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expedition only in
               passing or predominantly as a single entity. <hi rend="italic">So far as is possible
                  at this late date</hi>, they should be remembered in the way their captains
               thought of them and in the way they knew each other: as distinct and fallible human
               beings. In realizing their individuality, the key to their success–their
               unity–appears even more remarkable. By admitting their fallibility their heroic
               achievement becomes that much more inspiring.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Alexander Willard</name> lived to the
               ripe old age of eighty-seven—long enough to serve his country several times
               more (as a government blacksmith for the Sauk, Fox, Delaware, and Shawnee Indians,
               and in the War of 1812); long enough to marry and raise twelve children (one given
               the name Lewis, another <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>); long
               enough to be alive during the invention of photography and have his picture taken,
               his back proud and erect, his eyes confidently fixed straight ahead; long enough to
               play his part in yet another national transcontinental endeavor, the covered wagon
               migrations to the gold fields of California, where he died in 1865.<ref target="nduncanintro01" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>There is a faint suspicion that he did, in fact, keep a journal during his expedition
               with Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and the Corps of
               Discovery. Certainly he must have told and retold his adventures to his children and
               grandchildren in the many years that followed. How I wish that journal could be found
               in someone's attic or that one of <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s descendants had transcribed his reminiscences.<ref target="nduncanintro03" n="3"/>
            </p>
            <p>But even if such accounts were miraculously discovered, I doubt they would settle a
               question which, in the absence of conclusive facts to the contrary, I've decided to
               believe about <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Alexander Willard</name>.
               I believe he was asleep during night guard duty back on Camp New Island in 1804 And I
               think I know how <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant Ordway</name>
               discovered him and then knew immediately that <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> was both lying down and sleeping. He was
               snoring.</p>

            <p>I cannot close however, without mention of one more who has been of great assistance.
               Mrs. Dorothy Shields Lollier of Carlsbad, California, has researched the Shields
               family and has brought to my attention most of the information regarding that most
               valuable man to the expedition — John Shields.</p>
            <p>Mr. Anton J. Pregaldin of Clayton, Missouri, has generously supplied me with his
               research on those unsung members of the expedition, the French-Canadian engages. His
               findings, in a most difficult field, throw a helpful glimmer of light on those
               heretofore obscure watermen.</p>
            <p>Last, but far from least, I express deep gratitude to Anna Marie and Everett G. Hager
               for preparing the fine index. I am most fortunate in having all such outstanding

            <p>Now I can only hope that my own research and arrangement of all this scattered
               material will be helpful to future students of the Expedition.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>The Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition to the
               Pacific and return by way of the Missouri River in 1804-1806 was probably the best
               written and officially documented of all such governmental undertakings. Certainly
               its captains and several of its members made copious mention in their journals of the
               daily travels and notable sights encountered along the way. We have complete records
               of the material and supplies carried, details of the boats and medicines taken, and
               full reports on the Indians and strange animals and plants discovered. But a complete
               roster of all the men who set out with the expedition was never made.<ref target="nintro01" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, they omitted to mention much about themselves in their journals, for
               they were innocently unaware that they were creating history. True, the captains do
               mention a member now and then, but that is about all. They were certainly convinced
               that no biographical data was necessary, for this was a military command.</p>
            <p>After the expedition successfully returned in 1806, there was a long delay before the
               publication of their journals in 1814.<ref target="nintro02" n="2"/> The War of 1812
               occupied the nation's attention, and for a long lapse of years the members of the
               expedition were forgotten.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study is an attempt to bring these men into being again and to
               rescue them from oblivion so far as is possible at this late date. Therefore, it is
               not the purpose here to discuss the reasons that brought the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition into being. However, I
               think it pertinent to recall that an investigation of what lay beyond the Mississippi
               had for many years been in <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas
                  Jefferson</name>'s mind.</p>
            <p>At least two of his previous plans to cross the continent — that of <name type="person" key="Ledyard, John">John Ledyard</name> and Andrew Michaux —
               had come to naught. <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> knew
               of the recently published account of <name type="person" key="Mackenzie, Alexander">Alexander Mackenzie</name>'s journal which contained a detailed plan of how Great
               Britain might set up posts at the mouth of the Columbia River, and at other suitable
               ports. These were to control the ever increasing numbers of American ships that were
               then dominating the sea-otter trade to the Orient. These plans also included control
               of the fur trade and fisheries of that part of Western America.</p>
            <p>These international schemes were plain to <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>, and they had to be averted before they became permanently
               established. The United States had a claim to the Oregon country because <name type="person" key="Gray, Robert">Captain Robert Gray</name> was the first to
               discover and enter the mouth of the Columbia River in 1792. This claim could be
               strengthened by an overland expedition to, and exploration of, the lands bordering
               the upper waters of the Columbia — and by descending that river to the sea.</p>
            <p>In the winter of 1802, <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>
               instructed his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, who was skilled at frontier
               living and who had recently served in several campaigns with the army, to study
               botany, zoology, medicine, and celestial navigation in preparation for leading an
               expedition to the Pacific.</p>
            <p>In a secret appeal to Congress on January 18, 1803, the sum of "Twenty-five Hundred
               Dollars" was appropriated for "An intelligent officer with ten or twelve chosen men,
               fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it, taken from our military posts,
               where they may be spared without inconvenience, might explore the whole line, even to
               the Western Ocean." To further cinch the argument, <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> mentioned that "The soldiers pay would be
               going on, whether here or there" and that "the appropriation of Twenty-five Hundred
               Dollars for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States
               — would cover the undertaking."<ref target="nintro03" n="3"/> In the light of
               recent study, it appears that Congress was privy to an understanding, not openly
               admitted, of the "official" request for appropriations. In early 1803, the jealousies
               of England, France, and Spain were not to be aroused by a large military party
               snooping around in disputed domains. Furthermore, the influential fur trading
               companies did not look with favor on this constant probing into their lands. The
               inevitable settlement which followed was contrary to the source of their income.</p>
            <p>But before the year 1803 was finished, it became evident that such a small party as
               ten or twelve men could never overcome the Indians who zealously contested the
               passage to the upper Missouri River. The British traders already in that country did
               not desire competition from traders coming up the Missouri from the south, and they
               did all in their power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1803, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>
               was firmly convinced by Auguste Chouteau, <name type="person" key="Lisa, Manuel">Manuel Lisa</name> and other experienced traders, who had for many years been
               familiar with the lower Missouri — that a stronger, and hence, larger party,
               would be necessary to command respect, and safe traverse of the Missouri waters.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> kept <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> advised of these
               developments, and the latter adroitly managed the additional funds required.
               Historians may never learn how this was done, but the fact remains that it was. To
               help matters, he had as we say today, "something special going for him" in 1803.
               Louisiana, which in those days was about all the lands west of the Mississippi to the
               western mountains (wherever they were), changed hands from Spain to France to the
               United States in that year. That transaction removed some of the sticky diplomatic
               difficulties, although Spain remained convinced that the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> party really intended to take over
               the Spanish establishments. Spain actually sent out from Santa Fe in 1804 an overland
               expedition to cut Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
                  off.<ref target="nintro04" n="4"/> Fortunately it could not find them.</p>
            <p>During the summer and fall of 1803, Lewis and his coleader, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>, were recruiting and testing men as
               possible prospects for the rigorous adventures that lay ahead. While the men were
               selected with great care, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain
                  Lewis</name> was authorized to offer the following inducements to those enlisting:
                  <ref target="nintro05" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <quote rend="indented">
               <p>FIRST: The bounty (if not a soldier) but in both cases, six months pay in advance.
                  Pay of $10.00 per month, plus clothing and subsistence</p>
               <p>SECOND: To discharge them from service if they wish it, immediately on their
                  return from the expedition, giving them their arrears of pay, clothing, etc.</p>
               <p>THIRD : To secure to them a portion of land equal to that given by the United
                  States to the officers and soldiers who served in the Revolutionary War.</p>
            </quote>
            <p>
               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> was authorized to
               select by voluntary engagement, men from the companies of Captains Russell and <name type="person" key="Bissell, Daniel">Daniel Bissell</name>, and of <name type="person" key="Stoddard, Amos">Captain Amos Stoddard</name> now occupying the
               posts of Fort Massac and Fort Kaskaskia. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> was also authorized to engage any other men, not soldiers,
               whom he thought useful in promoting the objects or success of the expedition. They
               were to recruit "some good hunters; stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the
               woods, and capable of bearing bodily fatigues to a considerable degree. The hunters
               were to be engaged with the understanding that they were to bear the common labor of
               the party and not to engage in hunting exclusively."</p>
            <p>With <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>'s agreement to
               join <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> in the
               expedition, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was furnished with
               these instructions, and Lewis advised him to be on the lookout for suitable men.
               Several young gentlemen's sons applied to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, but as he felt they were not accustomed to labor, he had to
               diplomatically offer them no encouragement. He did temporarily engage some men who
               later became known as "The nine young men from Kentucky."</p>
            <p>Major William MacRae, Commandant at South West Point, Kentucky, was instructed to
               send six or eight soldiers as likely candidates from Tennessee to Fort Massac to
               await <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name>'s arrival.</p>
            <p>With this help and inducements, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain
                  Lewis</name> wrote <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> on
               September 28, 1803, that he felt "we shall be able to form our party without much
               difficulty; four or five French water-men I conceive will be essential, this we can
               do I presume very readily at St. Louis." In the same letter Lewis wrote, "I have two
               young men with me whom I have taken on trial and not yet engaged them, but
               conditionally only, though I think they will answer tolerably well." <ref target="nintro06" n="6"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> came down
               the Ohio River and was joined by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> at Louisville, some twelve temporary recruits also came along. At
               Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; in Kentucky, and at the frontier military posts of Fort
               Massac, Vincennes and Kaskaskia, other volunteers were recruited and transferred to
               Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s command.</p>
            <p>They formed a camp at Wood River (Camp du Bois) in Illinois, which in 1803 was about
               opposite the mouth of the Missouri River.<ref target="nintro07" n="7"/> This location
               was not too far from St. Louis, but sufficiently removed from its wine shops and
               women, and, most importantly, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in Spanish territory.
               Here during the winter and spring, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain
                  Clark</name> and <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergeant Ordway</name>
               observed and drilled the men who had been chosen thus far. All of them had been
               selected for their special talents and experiences as backwoods men. All were of a
               resourceful nature, and a few, such as one Mr. Leakins, who were overly resourceful,
               were rejected as being too undisciplined to serve under a military command.</p>
            <p>During the cold winter the men built huts, hunted deer, rabbits, racoons and turkeys
               for their sustenance. They had to build a sled in order to haul in enough firewood.
               Compatibility was established, and a pattern of camp life was begun which would
               prevail over the next two years.</p>
            <p>Whiskey peddlers soon found the camp, which caused some trouble. Discipline had to be
               enforced. Court-martial rules were set up for dealing with the red-blooded, rugged
               recruits who were frequently drunk. It is worthy of note that some of the men who
               later turned out to be the most valuable men of the party, were among those who had
               to be punished while at Camp Woods, as the following orders will show:</p>
            <div type="inset">
               <ab>
                  <hi rend="center">DETACHMENT ORDERS</hi>
               </ab>
               <p>The Commanding officer feels himself mortified and disappointed at the disorderly
                  conduct of <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reubin Fields</name> in
                  refusing to mount guard when in the due roteen of duty he was regularly warned;
                  nor is he less surprised at the want of discretion in those who urged his
                  opposition to the faithful discharge of his duty, particularly (John) Shields,
                  whose sense of propryety he had every reason to believe would have induced him
                  rather to have promoted good order, than to have excited disorder and faction
                  among the party, particularly in the absence of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and himself.</p>
               <p>The Commanding officer is also sorry to find any man, who has been engaged by
                  himself and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> for the
                  expedition on which they have entered, so destitute of understanding, as not to be
                  able to draw the distinction between being placed under the command of another
                  officer, whose will in such case would be their law, and that of obeying the
                  orders of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and himself
                  communicated to them through <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt.
                     Ordway</name>, who, as one of the party, has during their necessary absence
                  been charged with the execution of their orders; acting from those orders
                  expressly, and not from his own caprice, and who, is in all respects accountable
                  to us for the faithful observance of the same.</p>
               <p>A moments reflection must convince every man of our party, that were we to neglect
                  the more important and necessary arrangements in relation to the voyage we are now
                  entering on, for the purpose merely of remaining at camp in order to communicate
                  our orders in person to the individuals of the party on mere points of policy,
                  they would have too much reason to complain; nay, even to fear the ultimate
                  success of the enterprise in which we are all embarked. The abuse of some of the
                  party in respect with privilege heretofore granted them of going into the country,
                  is not less displeasing; to such therefore as have made hunting or other business
                  a pretext to cover their design of visiting a neighboring Whiskey shop, he cannot
                  for the present extend this privilege; and does therefore most positively direct
                  that <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, <name type="person" key="Boley, John">Bolye</name>, <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Wiser</name> and <name type="person" key="Robertson, John">Robinson</name> do
                  not receive permission to leave camp under any pretext whatever for <hi rend="italic">ten days</hi>, after this order is read on the parade, unless

                  of <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>. The Carpenters,
                  Blacksmiths, and in short the whole party (except <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, who has been specially directed to perform
                  other duties) are to obey implicity the orders of <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>, who has received our instructions and

               <p>This order obviously produced the desired effect, for we find all the men
                  mentioned to be members of the party when it started out, and <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>, <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s, John <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Peter Weiser</name> became members of the permanent party that went on to the
                  Pacific.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name>, as he was always
                  recognized by the party, though when his commission arrived was only as a second
                  lieutenant in the Artillery, spent most of the time at Camp Woods. He pondered the
                  provisions needed for the expedition, the loading of the three boats, and gave
                  considerable attention to those men who would be selected as permanent members who
                  were to cross the continent, and to those which would comprise the extra force
                  needed to get the equipment and provisions beyond the Indians who dominated the
                  lower Missouri. Try as he would, the total number always came out to be around
                  fifty men. In one of his notes he lists "Our party: 2 Captains; 4 Sergeants; 3
                  interpreters; 22 Americans; 9 or 10 Frenchmen, and <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, his slave. Plus 1 Corporal and 6 soldiers in a canoe with
                  provisions for the party as far as these provisions last."<ref target="nintro09" n="9"/> This totals 48 men if there were nine Frenchmen, or 49 if there were
                  ten.</p>
               <p>This is a point to remember when later the journalists all state the total number
                  of the party consisted of only fortyfive men.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name> had been
                  engaged to act as interpreter for the party. He was dispatched to Tennessee to
                  recruit men, and he returned on December 16, 1803, with eight men. One was a
                  blacksmith and another was a "Housejoiner." <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> wrote to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> in St. Louis "that he did not know
                  how they will answer our experiment, but I am a little disappointed in finding
                  them not possessed of more of the requisite qualifications. There is not a hunter
                  among them. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> nor
                  myself have made no particular bargain with them. I have offered <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> $25.00 per month for
                  as long as he may choose to continue with us."</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> spent most of the
                  time in St. Louis, procuring maps and every bit of information he could gather
                  regarding the land and natives resident up river. Additional medicines and
                  provisions for the voyage were obtained. He was advised that the best men for
                  propelling the boats were those French-Canadian water-men who lived at Kaskaskia
                  and Cahokia. These were villages on the Illinois side of the Mississippi near St.
                  Louis where these boatmen resided when not off on some trading adventure up the
                  Missouri or Mississippi rivers. With Mr. Chouteau's help, the most capable and
                  reliable men were engaged to man the boats as far as the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> Nation. Lewis wrote
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> that "Mr. Chouteau has
                  procured seven engages to go as far as the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> but they will not agree to go further, and
                  I found it impossible to reduce them to any other engagement than that usually
                  made with these people." <ref target="nintro10" n="10"/> Probably meaning that
                  they would not enlist in a military organization.</p>
               <p>Some of these engages may have been former employees of the North West Company of
                  Canada. John McDonnell, about the year 1795, wrote an account found in Masson's
                     <hi rend="italic">Les Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest</hi> (vol. I, p.
                  272) : "Many of the Company's servants (have been) deserting from the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> country with an
                  intention of going to the Illinois and other places on the Mississippi. . ." It is
                  possible that "La Liberte" (Jo Barter), <name type="person" key="Collin, Joseph">Joseph Collin</name> and Jean Baptiste DeChamps were former members of the
                  North West Company. Likewise, Francois Rivet, <name type="person" key="Primeau, Paul">Paul Primeau</name>, <name type="person" key="Roi, Peter">Peter Roi</name> and others could have originated from that source, for the
                  same, or variants of the name, appear in the rosters of the North West Company for
                  the years just prior to the formation of the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition. See for example, above citation,
                  pages 396–411.</p>
               <p>John Francis McDermott <ref target="nintro11" n="11"/> reprints an apt description
                  of the engage:</p>
               <quote rend="indented">
                  <p>These men carried out the necessary work of the trade; cordelling, poling or
                     rowing up the Missouri to operational headquarters, seeking out and trading
                     with the Indian villages; trapping the beaver and other fur-bearers; hunting
                     meat animals; maintaining the equipment, conveying the messages through the
                     unknown country; cooking; keeping camp; tending horses; and performing a score
                     of other regular and extra duties. Some of them were sons and grandsons of the
                     men who had come up the Mississippi River from New Orleans with Laclede and
                     Auguste Chouteau, and of this group some were native St. Lousians and many more
                     came from the settlements such as Fort Chartres, Kaskaskia, Cahokia and St.
                     Genevieve.</p>
               </quote>
               <p>The number of men now deemed necessary was a considerable advance over that
                  understood by Congress. In view of this situation, there could possibly have been
                  an understanding with <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President
                     Jefferson</name> that the "official" figure would be acceptable if the total
                  number did not exceed forty-five, including the two captains. This could be one of
                  the reasons that no complete roster was compiled by the captains at the outset of
                  the expedition.</p>
               <p>At any rate, all those who kept journals — Lewis, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> — dutifully record that the
                  total number was about forty-five men. They do not all agree on the number, but
                  none exceeds forty-five.</p>
               <p>So for over a hundred and fifty years this number has been accepted. As the names
                  of the entire roster had never been published, no one seemed to question it. Of
                  course, the names of the thirty men who had gone on to the Pacific were known and
                  recorded in the journals, but what of those twenty or so who had helped the party
                  up to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> villages,
                  had wintered there, and had returned to St. Louis in the early summer of 1805?
                  They brought back the maps and reports that had been made thus far, as well as
                  many crates of new animal, mineral and botanical specimens. They saw to it that
                  all this material was dispatched to <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> in Washington, and several of them conducted those Indians
                  who had been prevailed upon to visit the Great White Father, and had acted as
                  interpreters between them and <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>. All this was part and plan of the expedition from
                  its original conception.</p>
               <p>To many students of the expedition, these men <hi rend="italic">were</hi>
                  important to the success of the enterprise. It has since been felt that more
                  should be known of the entire party— just who they were — and as much
                  biographical information should be collected as is possible.</p>
               <p>As the journals were studied, it also became evident that more men returned from
                  the expedition than the forty-five that were stated to have gone at its start.</p>
               <p>In the December 1944, issue of the <hi rend="italic">Oregon Historical
                     Quarterly</hi>,<ref target="nintro12" n="12"/> I submitted a roster and made
                  the suggestion that the number should be forty-seven including the captains. I
                  presented a list of forty-five, plus additional names that merited consideration.
                  At that time I felt it presumptuous for a mere student to fly into the face of the
                  scholars and historians who had edited the journals. Since 1944, much new material
                  has been published which substantiates, and even elaborates on that thinking.</p>
               <p>In 1964, <hi rend="italic">The Field Notes of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>
                  </hi>, 1803–1804, edited by
                  Ernest S. Osgood, were published by the Yale University Press. <hi rend="italic">The Letters of the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition, with Related Documents</hi> 1783–1854,
                  edited by Donald Jackson, were published in 1962 by the University of Illinois
                  Press. Each adds bits of additional information regarding the personnel. It now
                  appears that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> was
                  right when he noted a party of about fifty men.</p>
               <p>But even if we accept this new figure, we are still far from an easy solution as
                  to the names of the men, for the captains, especially <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, had a charming disregard for the accuracy of
                  spelling. When it came to proper names, almost any combination of letters seemed
                  to suffice. Take the name of <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Corporal Richard Warfington</name> for example. We find it rendered <hi rend="italic">Warfington, <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Worthington</name>, <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Worbington</name>, <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Worthyton</name>
                  </hi> and even more exotic variations. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name> was nearly always <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>
                  </hi>.
                  But those are the easy ones. In another case we have <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Carr</name>n, <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Carr</name>, <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">
                        <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Cane</name>
                     </name> or Cann</hi>, all
                  apparently meant to represent one person. I need not here show what happened to
                  the spelling of the French names. That will be found in the roster.</p>
               <p>As though this were not problem enough, we also have those who, following the
                  success of the expedition, attempted to climb on the band-wagon and publicly claim
                  that they had been members of the party. There are many examples, of which it is
                  sufficient to cite only one:</p>
               <quote rend="indented">
                  <p>Benjamin Jones was a noted hunter, trapper and surveyor of early times in
                     Missouri. His father was an Englishman who settled in Virginia at an early
                     date. He had two sons, Lewis and Benjamin. The latter ran away from home when
                     he was sixteen years of age, and came to St. Louis, where he joined the Indians
                     and engaged in trapping, until Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> started on their expedition, when he
                     joined their party in the capacity of a scout. Before the expedition reached
                     the Pacific Ocean, he and one or two others were sent back to St. Louis with
                     dispatches. They fell into an Indian ambuscade, lost their horses, and had to
                     perform the journey on foot, which occupied six months but they arrived safely
                     and delivered the dispatches.<ref target="nintro13" n="13"/>
                  </p>
               </quote>
               <p>Now the first part of this notice could be true, for this Benjamin Jones <hi rend="italic">was</hi> on the Missouri in 1809–1810, and was a hunter
                  with the government service on the Santa Fe trail in 1825. But we find no other
                  documented mention of where Jones was ever a member of the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition.</p>
               <p>The student can only sift these momentarily exciting bits of data, and present
                  those which seem to contain honest paydirt. My roster which follows, has been
                  compiled from the researchers who were on the scene some sixty-five years ago,
                  such as Reuben G. Thwaites, <name type="person" key="Coues, Elliott">Elliott
                     Coues</name>, Eva Emery Dye,<ref target="nintro14" n="14"/> Olin D.
                     Wheeler,<ref target="nintro15" n="15"/> James K. Hosmer <ref target="nintro16" n="16"/> and others. They all gave an account of the men, as far as they knew
                  at the time. In addition we have the works of Bradbury,<ref target="nintro17" n="17"/> Brackenridge,<ref target="nintro18" n="18"/> Henry,<ref target="nintro19" n="19"/> and others who lived in, and wrote of the days when
                  some of these men were still living. Army records and considerable genealogical
                  research have also added details for a more complete picture. I have used them all
                  as sources in compiling my roster.</p>
               <p>Probably not all historians and researchers will ever agree on exactly which men
                  actually started out with Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. A few of the French engages seem to have disappeared from the
                  records, so further data on them is completely lacking. Just when a solution seems
                  to be reached, a new name will crop up. For example, we find a new one in <hi rend="italic">The Field Notes of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>
                  </hi> previously mentioned. On page 244 of that work we
                  find in a tentative list of engages, a very legible "<name type="person" key="Cann, E.">E. Cann</name>" written in someone's hand. It is interesting to
                  note in the same reproduction of the original document that two of the engages'
                  names are joined together in one: William Labiece Mallat. These are surely William
                     <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> and Etienne
                  Malboeuf. On page 278 Cann is written out in what appears to my perhaps prejudiced
                  eye as "<name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Carn</name>," though on page 118 Dr.
                  Osgood deciphers the word as "Cane." In all my many years of study and research
                  "Cann" and "Cane" are new names to me. To my knowledge none of the journals, nor
                  the vast literature of the fur trade which followed the expedition, even suggests
                  this name.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, one of the spellings in the original journals under date of
                  August 13, 1804, is <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Carr</name>n</hi>. In the <hi rend="italic">Field Notes</hi>, page 48,
                  there is the word <hi rend="italic">Carseux</hi> written over an entry. This is
                  not singular, for on the entry for July 5, 1804, we find the name of Howard
                  — one of the members — written over it. In The <hi rend="italic">Territorial Papers of the United States</hi>,<ref target="nintro20" n="20"/>
                  under date of December 28, 1805, we find that <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander Carson</name>, along with <name type="person" key="Lisa, Manuel">Manuel Lisa</name>, <name type="person" key="Robidoux, Joseph">Joseph
                     Robidoux</name>, Pierre Chouteau, John Carson, <name type="person" key="Robertson, John">John Robertson</name> and hundreds of others, were
                  signers of a memorial attesting to the good conduct of Governor Wilkinson. John
                  Bradbury <ref target="nintro21" n="21"/> states that <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander Carson</name> was near the head of the Missouri in
                  1807–1808. In 1809 <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander

               <p>Whatever led to the crime, is more than anyone knows. Carson had been stopping at
                  my house two or three weeks, this Boney, his wife, and son with him. Carson was
                  sick. When he thought he was able to travel, left my house accompanied by Boney,
                  Boney's wife and son. The first night after leaving my house (he) camped at
                  Ellick's Butte, the whole tribe camped there. Boney arose in the night, stole out
                  of Carson's tent his (Carson's) rifle, which he held in reserve and holding up the
                  curtain of the tent so that the light of the fire might shine on Carson, compelled
                  his son (a lad of twelve or fourteen years) to shoot him in the head with a
                  shot-gun, blowing his brains all over the tent.</p>
               <p>The body was thrown in a small stream, and the plunder distributed out amongst the
                  tribe. I may mention here an Indian by the name of Click-kowin who was said to be
                  a half Killamook, and was with the Killamooks a portion of his time, was accessory
                  to the murder, and shared in the plunder.</p>
               <p>Boney, and his son, died soon after the murder was committed, and Click-kowin was
                  shot after the murder, by Waaninkapah, the Chief of the Nefalitin tribe.</p>
               <p>Those Indians have never atoned for the crime, they were compelled to give up a
                  portion of the plunder which was delivered over to William Cannin, a cousin of
                  Carsons. Boney's son confessed the crime and went with us and showed where all the
                  plunder had been cached, as far as he knew of.</p>
               <p>Carson came out to the Mountains with Lewis &amp; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and after returning to the States, engaged
                  with Hunt in 1811 and returned to this country, and remained here.</p>

               <p>I quote this letter in full, except for some irrelevant matter at the opening,

                  service. Heretofore, historians have questioned that they were members of the
                  expedition.</p>
               <p>As I have shown above, Lewis was authorized to hire, rather than enlist, extra
                  men, which he apparently did and paid some of them off at Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> in the spring of 1805.
                  Note the entry under date of August 22, 1806, where we read:</p>

                     requested to return with us. We agreed to give him passage down [to St. Louis].

               <p>This would seem to be proof that a few of the men were not enlisted, but were
                  hired for the trip up the Missouri only, and were paid wages out of funds in hand.
                  The others were paid by <name type="person" key="Stoddard, Amos">Captain Amos

                  muster rolls and were not entitled to extra pay and land warrants as the enlisted
                  men later were. This may also be a reason why the journalists list only forty-five
                  men, for they might not have considered the hired, extra men as technically a part
                  of the expedition.</p>
               <p> In the revised <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Private Joseph Whitehouse</name> Journal</hi>, as yet unpublished, there is
                  found a partial list of the members who set out and adds "8 Canadians who were
                  only to proceed with us to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>."</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander Carson</name> could have been one of
                  these extra men, for with the evidence I have shown, and the entry in the journals
                  for August 18, 1804,<ref target="nintro24" n="24"/> where it is stated: "Detached

                  [italics mine], we know that such a man <hi rend="italic">was</hi> with the
                  expedition. Thwaites appears to have had some evidence, for on page 109 he notes
                  after the word <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Carr</name>n "(Carson–
                  editor)."</p>
               <p>The above evidence, while not conclusive, is the best we have at present. However,
                  I believe it is strong enough that <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander
                     Carson</name> should be considered as one of the party until such time as we
                  have positive contrary evidence.</p>
               <p>In connection with these "alleged members," it may be of interest to report a
                  sidelight that is of record. As shown, the previously mentioned <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander Carson</name>, in his last years, was
                  living in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. A companion of his trapping days,
                  William Canning, was living on a farm nearby. William Canning was a bona fide
                  mountain man, and had been with Wilson P. Hunt's Astorian party of 1810.<ref target="nintro25" n="25"/> When Charles Wilkes, U.S.N., wrote of his Oregon
                  explorations of 1841 <ref target="nintro26" n="26"/> he stated:</p>
               <quote rend="indented">
                  <p>At Champoeg, Willamette Valley, was an old man by the name of Cannon [there
                     goes that spelling again — author] who had been one of the party with
                     Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and from his
                     own account, the only remaining one in the country. . .</p>
               </quote>
               <p>Now Canning should have been aware that Francois Rivet, who was a member of the
                  party as far as the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, was living on a farm nearby. We can forgive him that he may not
                  have known that <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name> was
                  living in West Virginia at the time. But he may just be bragging about himself.
                  Mountain men had a bad habit of doing that.</p>
               <p>Wilkes of course did not mention the fact that Alexander Carson had, in 1829, made
                  a will in favor of Canning, and that after Carson had been murdered in 1836,
                  Canning had claimed from the Hudson's Bay Company, the balance of accounts that
                  were due Carson.<ref target="nintro27" n="27"/> It appears that in his relation to
                  Wilkes, Canning was also trying to claim Carson's role as a Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> member.</p>
               <p>There is ample documentary evidence to show that Carson and Canning were two
                  different men. It is tempting to speculate that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> could have been referring to Canning
                  when he rendered the name as Cann and Cane. But it is difficult to imagine that
                  the clearly legible E. of E. Cann could be taken to mean an initial for William.
                  "G" for the French spelling of William perhaps, but hardly an "E". We have already
                  seen that Ellick is one of the spellings, along with Alec., as a nickname for
                  Alexander.</p>
               <p>In any event, neither Canning, Cannin, nor Cannon is ever mentioned in conection
                  with Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> until Wilkes
                  quotes him in 1845.</p>
               <p>I have given all this Carson material as a typical example of the research done to
                  arrive at the most complete and correct roster possible. In an attempt to gather
                  further information, I appended additional data to my 1944 roster, and it was
                  published in the DAR Magazine for November, 1965.<ref target="nintro28" n="28"/>
                  The idea for submitting the story to that magazine was to solicit the aid of the
                  members of the DAR who may be descended from some of these men, and who would
                  furnish genealogical information. I am happy to acknowledge that quite a bit of
                  new information has been acquired, and is collected here for the first time. In no
                  case have I used "family tradition," but only include data that is fully
                  documented. I am particularly pleased that some of the members who heretofore have
                  had the notation after their names — "Nothing more known of him" —
                  have been rescued from oblivion.</p>
               <p>By the time the winter of 1803 had passed into the spring of 1804, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> had decided on which of
                  the men would be taken along on the expedition. Many of them had been transferred
                  from their former military units as of January 1, 1804, onto the muster rolls of
                  the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition.
                  Later, some of the French water-men had been enlisted, but others were hired as
                  extra hands. The provisions and Indian trade goods were divided so that some of
                  each were placed in separate boxes in order that all would not be lost in case of
                  accident. The air gun was mounted on the keel-boat and the arms checked and put in
                  order. The powder was contained in cannisters of lead which could later be melted
                  and molded into bullets when the cannisters were empty. A hundred other details
                  had to be thought out and arranged, for once the expedition set out, no other
                  supplies could be obtained in the frontier country into which they were going.</p>
               <p>At long last, spring arrived, and the Missouri was showing signs of becoming
                  navigable. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> was in
                  St. Louis winding up the many last minute details, including a conference with a

                  soon found out that the keel-boat was too heavily loaded in the stern. On the
                  nights of the 14th and 15th, they camped along the river, for this presented an
                  opportunity to test the arrangement of the men into messes, or groups, where each
                  prepared its own meals. This pre-arrangement was continued until May 26th of the
                  voyage when a few changes were made. On the 16th of May, the party arrived at St.
                  Charles, where, during the following four days, the cargoes were reloaded. On the

               <p>The gentlemen of the village gave a banquet and a ball for the party. It was the

                  orders were given for departure, and despite the rain, a farewell parade was
                  given. The band played all the way down the mile long main street fronting the

                  <p>Born, August 18, 1774, near Ivy, seven miles west of Charlottesville, Virginia,
                     of <name type="native_nation" key="Welsh Indians">Welsh</name> parentage. Son
                     of William and Lucy (Meriwether) Lewis. Well educated, blond– sunny hair;
                     bowlegged, particular, precise, serious, reserved and inclined to melancholia
                     and hypochondria. He served in the 1st Infantry, U.S. Army and in Gen. Wayne's
                     northwestern campaigns. In 1801 he was appointed Pres. <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>'s private secretary. After the
                     expedition, he was appointed the Governor of Louisiana Territory. Clerks in
                     Washington protested some of his drafts — some of which were connected
                     with the expedition — which caused him emotional strain. He decided to go
                     to Washington to explain the drafts, and while enroute on the Natchez Trace, he
                     died, either by murder or suicide, on October 11, 1809. A monument stands at
                     his burial place on the Trace near Nashville, Tennessee. He never married. <ref target="nbioroster02" n="2"/>

                     Six feet tall, red-haired, a popular leader of men. He was promised a captaincy
                     by Lewis, and received the same pay and recognition as a captain, though when
                     the commission was received, it was for a second lieutenant. When the
                     expedition returned to St. Louis he promptly returned the commission on October
                     10, 1806. After the expedition he was appointed Indian Agent, and after Lewis'
                     death, the Governor of Missouri.</p>
                  <p> He married first, on January 5, 1808, Miss <name type="person" key="Hancock, Julia">Julia Hancock</name> of Fincastle, Virginia. She died
                     June 27, 1820 leaving four sons and a daughter. He married second, Mrs. Harriet
                     Kennerly, widow of Dr. John Radford. One son survived this marriage. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name> died in St. Louis on

                     with stories about his adventures with the expedition, which became taller with
                     each telling. He died of cholera in Tennessee.</p>

                     on August 1, 1803, in Kentucky, and is therefore listed as one of the "Nine

                  <p>Born, July 12, 1771, at Falling Springs, near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, of
                     Irish descent. He was a son of Benjamin and Mary (McLene) <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>. Dark complexion, grey eyes, dark hair,
                     short, burley, barrel-chested. "His talk unconventional — better suited
                     for the camp than the parlor." He was recruited from Capt. <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Russell Bissell</name>'s 1st Infantry at Kaskaskia,
                     and his pay started with Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> as of January 1, 1804. He had enlisted in the loth U.S.
                     Infantry in 1799 at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, after having served in a Ranger
                     Company in 1792. He was a fine carpenter, boat builder, woodsman and great wit.
                     After <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles Floyd</name>'s death, he
                     was elected sergeant. After the expedition, he served in the War of 1812 under
                     Capt. Kingsly of Nashville, Tennessee. In March 1813, he was at Fort Massac,
                     Kentucky, then at Bellefontaine, Missouri. In 1814, he ascended the Ohio to
                     Pittsburgh, then on to Fort Erie. He was in the battle of Lundy's Lane; then to
                     Sackett's Harbor. He lost his left eye at Fort Independence in June 1815, and
                     was discharged and pensioned in the same month for total disability. He married
                     at the age of sixty, in 1831, to Maria Hamilton, aged twenty. They were the
                     parents of six children: Benjamin, William, James, Sarah, Annie and Rachel.</p>
                  <p>He died April 2, 1870, aged almost ninety-nine years — the sole survivor
                     of the expedition. He is buried at Brooke County Cemetery, at Wellsburg, West
                     Virginia. He was the first to publish a journal of the expedition in 1807,
                     seven years before the official Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> journals were finally printed in 1814.

                     Stephen, lived near Hebron, New Hampshire, in the spring of 1804. He was
                     recruited from Capt. Bissell's 1st Infantry Company at Kaskaskia and went on
                     Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s payroll as of
                     January 1, 1804, though he was in charge of Camp du Bois much of the time
                     before this date. He was educated and kept a journal which, after being lost
                     for over a hundred years, was published in 1916. He was held in high esteem by
                     his commanders. He kept the orderly books and held other important duties while
                     on the expedition.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition returned in 'Sob, he witnessed the sale on September 29,

                     then he returned to New Hampshire for a time. In 1809 he returned to Missouri
                     and settled in the Tywappity Bottom, near New Madrid, Missouri. He became an
                     owner of extensive lands and attained some prosperity — having two
                     plantations of peach and apple orchards. He married in Missouri, and he and his
                     wife, Gracy, died in Missouri about 1817. They left no survivors.<ref target="nbioroster07" n="7"/>

                  <p>Born in 1772, probably in Amherst County, Virginia. He was a son of John and
                     Nancy (<name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>) <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>. She was a sister of

                     the father of Charles <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>
                     — also a member of the expedition. Therefore, <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> were cousins. He moved with his parents in
                     1783 to Kentucky, and was recruited by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> on October 20, 1803. He is usually listed as one of
                     the "Nine young men from Kentucky." He married on May 17, 1798, Miss Peggy
                     Patton, so was one of the few married men of the expedition. His leaders
                     stated, "He was a man of character and ability." He probably kept a journal,
                     but it has not yet been discovered. His journal is said to have been lost while
                     enroute to France for publication. After the expedition returned, he was one of
                     the party who in 1807 attempted to return the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> Chief, Shahaka, to his homeland, but was
                     prevented from doing so by the Arikara Indians. Nathaniel H. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> remained in the army
                     and was a second lieutenant until 1810. He then entered the Indian trade on the
                     upper Mississippi. In 1812 he was attacked at Fort Madison where he nearly lost
                     his life. Two of his men were slain, but he escaped by crossing the ice of the
                     Mississippi. He re-entered the army in 1813, and in 1814 he became a captain.
                     He served in the Battle of New Orleans. Later, he was discharged and he then
                     set up a trading post on the Arkansas River. He married an <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name> girl, and they had
                     several children who were all given Indian names. They lived among the <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name>s until his death on
                     June 1, 1831. He is buried at <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, Mayes County, Oklahoma, where a monument has been erected to
                     his honor. He is not the same <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Nathaniel Pryor</name> of Pattie's Narrative. This was Nathaniel "Miguel"

                     some resistance on the part of his commander who did not want to lose him. He
                     was tall, straight, and had black hair and dark eyes. He was adept in the

                     judgement were needed.</p>
                  <p> After the expedition he lived for a few years at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He
                     bought the land warrants of John <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph

                     he had the funds to make land purchases. He made a return trip to the Rocky
                     Mountains and gave <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William

                     (BRATTEN).</label>
                  <p>Born, July 27, 1778, in Augusta County, Virginia, of Irish parentage. He
                     probably is a son of George <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>, or of George's brother, James, who were sons of Capt.
                     Robert <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and his
                     wife, Mrs. Annie (McFarland) Dunlap. Robert <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> came to America from Donegal,
                     Ireland, about 1740, and later settled in Cowpasture, Augusta County, Virginia.
                     I give these clues to William's ancestry because there is yet some confusion as
                     to just which of the brothers was William's father.</p>
                  <p>It is reported William's family migrated to Kentucky about 1790, and on October
                     20, 1803, William enlisted under <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name> for the expedition. Hence he is usually listed as one
                     of the "Nine young men from Kentucky." His middle name may be Elliott, for it
                     appears this was his mother's name. This "E" was adopted during his Indiana
                     years to distinguish him from another William <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>, probably his cousin, who also
                     lived near Waynetown, Indiana, and with whom he has often been confused.</p>

                     <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">William E. Bratton</name> was
                     over six feet tall, square of build, very straight and erect, rather reserved,
                     economical, of fine intelligence and the strictest morals. At an early age he
                     was apprenticed to a blacksmith, possibly his father, or uncle, James, and
                     later became an excellent gunsmith and blacksmith on the expedition. In these
                     capacities, and as a hunter, he was a useful man.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition had reached the mouth of the Columbia River in November
                     1805, <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and four
                     companions were assigned to salt making at the seashore. They produced enough
                     salt for the expedition's winter requirements as well as enough to last them
                     for the return trip to the states. While working at this exposed task, <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> became seriously ill
                     of lumbago. He became so weak that he could hardly walk, although the captains
                     did everything in their power to help him. At long last, on May 24, 1806, an
                     Indian steam bath was constructed as a forlorn hope of saving his life. This
                     proved effective, and soon <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> was able to resume his duties. <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>'s conscientious service was
                     attested to by the discharge he received at the end of the expedition.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition, <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> returned to Kentucky. He lived there for a time, but
                     returned to Missouri where he lived near <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">John Ordway</name> for a few years. He enlisted from Kentucky for the War
                     of 1812, and was one of those surrendered at Frenchtown (now Monroe, Michigan)
                     on January 22, 1813. He sold his warrant for land to a Mr. Samuel Barclay in
                     1816.</p>
                  <p>When aged forty-one, he married on November 25, 1819, Miss Mary H. Maxwell
                     (1796-1875) and they resided for a time at Greenville, Ohio. By the year 1822,
                     in June, William located on some land at Waynetown, Indiana. They were the
                     parents of eight sons and two daughters, one of whom, Griselda Ann, married a
                     Mr. Stephen Fields. It was she who gave the first brief biographical data to
                     Olin D. Wheeler, who incorporated this data into his roster found in his The

                     as of January 1, 1804, he was possibly transferred from Capt. <name type="person" key="Bissell, Russell">Russell Bissell</name>'s Company. He
                     was one of the best hunters of the party. While at Camp du Bois, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> once noted him as a

                  <p>Born about 1774, near Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia. He was a son of
                     Joseph and Ellen (Shields) <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>
                     and a grandson of Micajah Coalter. When he was about five years old, his
                     parents moved to Maysville, Kentucky. John spent his boyhood in Maysville and
                     as a young man he probably served as a Ranger under Simon Kenton.</p>
                  <p>He was five feet ten inches tall; rather shy; had blue eyes; an open pleasing
                     countenance; was quick minded, courageous and a fine hunter. He was recruited
                     by <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> at
                     Maysville on October 15, 1803 — one of the "Nine young men from Kentucky"
                     and a permanent member of the expedition. He was trusted with many special
                     missions while with the party.</p>
                  <p>When the expedition was enroute home, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> was honorably discharged on August 13, 1806. He returned to

                        Dickson</name>, free trappers from Missouri and Illinois. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> had probably known both men
                     during his Maysville days. The partnership with <name type="person" key="Hancock, Forrest">Handcock</name> and <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Dickson</name> lasted only some six weeks, for a

                     October 1806, and they spent the winter there. In the spring of 1807, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> started for St. Louis alone,
                     and by July he was at the mouth of the Platte River when he encountered, and

                     River. During 1808–1809, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> trapped the area around the Stinking Water (<name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name>) River.</p>
                  <p>By May 1809, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> had returned
                     to St. Louis. He sold his military warrant for land, probably to the land
                     speculator, John G. Comegys. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> soon signed up with Andrew Henry whose trapping expedition
                     was headed for the upper Missouri. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> was sent with a party to trap the rich beaver country of the
                     Blackfeet Indians. Because of his past friendship with the Crows —mortal
                     enemies of the Blackfeet— <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> was forced into a conflict with the latter. He escaped from

                     returned to St. Louis. Back in Missouri, probably in early 1811, he married a
                     woman named "Sallie." Mrs. Dye, in The Conquest, page 311, states, "Coalter
                     – married a squaw." Other traditions say she was a white woman.
                     Whichever, they settled on a farm near Charette, Franklin County, Missouri.
                     They had a son, Hiram <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, who
                     became the father of eight children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> died about November
                     22, 1813. Dr. E. B. Trail writes that according to local tradition, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> was buried in a cemetery near
                     Dundee, Missouri, on Tunnel Hill, which was located between the Big and Little

                     cemetery. The remains were said to have been scattered along the railroad fill.

                     William, later was a member of Congress from Ohio. George was Protestant-Irish,
                     a good singer, hunter and horseman. He frequently was lost, but always managed

                  <p>Born in 1769 near Harrisonburg, Augusta County, Virginia. Being aged
                     thirty-five, he appears to be the oldest man of the round-trip party. He was
                     the son of Robert and Nancy (Stockton) Shields, the sixth son and one of ten
                     brothers and an older sister. In 1784, his parents emigrated to Pidgeon Forge
                     in what is now Sevier County, Tennessee. Here John ran a mill and a blacksmith
                     shop for his brother-in-law, Samuel Wilson. About 1790, he married Nancy
                     _______, and they had a daughter, Janette. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> enlisted in the expedition on
                     October 19, 1803, in Kentucky, and is considered one of the "Nine young men
                     from Kentucky." He was one of the most valuable men on the expedition, as he
                     was the head blacksmith, gunsmith, boat builder and general repair man for
                     anything needed. His blacksmith work helped keep the party in corn and other
                     foodstuffs for much of the winter and spring of 1804–05.</p>
                  <p>When the expedition returned, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> wrote: "Shields had received the pay of only a
                     private. Nothing was more particularly useful to us, in various situations, in
                     repairing the guns, accoutrements, etc., and should it be thought proper to
                     allow him something [extra] as an artificer, he has well deserved it." In 1806
                     he received $180.00 in back pay, and in 1807, $178.50 in extra pay (as did the
                     others), plus a warrant for land located in Franklin County, Missouri.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition, he spent a year trapping with his kinsman, Daniel Boone,
                     in Missouri, and the following year with Squire Boone in Indiana. He died in
                     December 1809, and is probably buried among some of his brothers in "Little
                     Flock Baptist Burying Grounds," south of Corydon, Harrison County, Indiana. His
                     wife Nancy, survived him. Their only daughter, Janette, married her cousin,
                     John Tipton, and they left descendants. John Tipton was an executor of his
                        will.<ref target="nbioroster17" n=""/>

                  <p> Probably a son of Ambrose and Marie (Boyet) La Jeunnesse of St. Rose, Quebec,
                     Canada. He had married at St. Louis, July 9, 1797, Elisabeth Malbeuf and they
                     were the parents of : Reine, born 1801 ; Jean Baptiste, Jr., born 1803; and
                     Marie Louise, born 1807. All were baptized at St. Charles. He apparently died
                     in late 1806, for his wife married a Mr. Poirier of St. Charles on September
                     19, 1807. It may be his son, Jean Baptiste, Jr., who is buried in St. Paul
                     Parish, Oregon.</p>
                  <p>As shown above, La Jeunnesse was another of the married men of the expedition.
                     There were several other La Jeunnesse families but it probably was his nephew,
                     Basil, born June 25, 1814, at St. Louis, son of Jacques and Helene Le Vasseur,
                     who accompanied Fremont on his first and second expeditions to the west in
                        1842–1843.<ref target="nbioroster26" n=""/>

                  <p>He was from Lac de Sable, Canada — a brother-in-law of La Jeunnesse,
                     above. His father, Francois Malbeuf, baptized at least seven children by two or
                     three Indian women. Elisabeth, his daughter by Angelique, a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> woman, was baptized
                     at St. Charles in 1797 and married Jean Baptiste La Jeunnesse two months later
                     on July 9, 1797. Etienne was baptized at St. Charles on December 26, 1792, but
                     no age nor date of birth is given in the Parish Register. He must have been
                     born about 1775 as he was old enough to serve as godfather to a child of his
                     sister, Elisabeth, and her husband, Jean Baptiste La Jeunnesse, in 1802. By
                     1804 Etienne was living in Kaskaskia where he was hired for the expedition.

                  <p>Born near Montreal, Canada, in 1757, he was hired at Kaskaskia. Rivet was the
                     man who "danced on his head" at the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> parties. He, with three others, DeChamps,

                     built a hut of their own next to Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>, and remained there under the protection

                  <p>In the spring of 1805, Rivet and Philippe Degie —who had attached himself
                     to the party on October 18, 1804 — built a canoe of their own and
                     descended the Missouri with Warfington's return party as far as the Arikara

                  <p>He was an interpreter for Alexander Ross on the Snake Expedition of 1824, and
                     was at Flathead Post in 1825. He is reported to have been at Fort Colville for
                     "forty years as a sort of confidential man and blacksmith" where he worked for
                     the Hudson's Bay Company. "Here I found an old man, who thirty years before had

                     adventuresome people came from Montreal and Quebec. One was Pierre Roy who
                     married Marie Jeanne La Lande at Ste. Genevieve (later Missouri) on January 27,
                     1776. They had a son, Pierre, born April 27, 1786. This could be our man,

                  <p>Born about 1775, possibly in Mississippi. He was a son of <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Alexander Carson</name>, Sr., who probably was an older
                     brother of Lindsey, father of the famous "Kit" Carson. His grandparents were

                     Pennsylvania about 1755 and to North Carolina in 1760. His father settled in
                     Mississippi in 1760 and it is possible that his son, in his formative years,
                     lived so long among the French that he became known as a "French" engagee. This
                     theory may account for the variants in the spelling of his name.</p>

                     which definitely places someone of like name as a member of the party. He is of

            <p>So here we have a roster of fifty-one men who are recorded at one place or another in
               the various journals as being members of the party. It seems to be the most accurate
               roster that can be determined.</p>
            <p>A few names appear on tentative lists, that do not appear later on the expedition.
               They may be among those temporary men at Camp Woods for a time, but as <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name> states: "Several men who
               voluntered for this expedition, relinquished the honor and privilege when the time
               came to start — in common phrase, they backed out."</p>
            <p>In view of the number of men who returned in the spring of 1805, we need extra men
               above the forty-five stated, to fill the roster. I have attempted to show this
               situation in the "Diary" which follows.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="introdiary" type="introdiary">
            <head>Introduction to the Diary</head>
            <p>I have compiled this composite "Diary" from the Biddle condensation of the Lewis and
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> journals, The Original
               Journals of Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, and the
               journals of <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>.
               These, with The Field Notes of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William
                  Clark</name>, are all the journals known at this time. In this compilation, I have
               selected those entries which concern the men, their health and welfare, with only
               enough material to set the locale and scene of each day's activities. I have tried to
               preserve the language of the journalists, but have had to use words of my own in
               order to connect the statements made by the various journalists. As all the
               descriptions of geography, ethnology, zoology, botany, mineralogy, meteorology and
               astronomy are omitted in this compilation, the result becomes a relation principally
               of the men, and therefore runs the risk of reading like a glorious hunting
               expedition. When one considers that the command practically lived off the land for
               more than two and a half years, then he realizes the great numbers of game animals
               required to feed and clothe the men. In some cases trivial matter is retained only
               because the name of the member is mentioned.</p>
            <p>In no sense is this "Diary" intended as a substitute for, nor a one volume
               condensation of, any of the journals. The real purpose of the expedition was not to
               extoll its members, but to explore and describe a new frontier. This purpose can only
               be found by a study of the original journals. As the men are rather lost in the maze
               of descriptive matter found there, the aim of this condensation is to bring them back
               into sight. It reveals their personalities and characters, and for that reason may be
               needed. As such, this con densation differs from Bernard DeVoto's excellent one
               volume edition of The Journals of Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, Boston, 1953, which retains the spelling and punctuation of the
               original journals.</p>
            <p>While some men receive more notice than others, yet it is a picture of them all, and
               one can sense the skills and qualifications of the men who overcame the various
               problems — and who made this particular expedition so successful. The reader
               becomes aware of the excellent planning of the commanders; their care to keep the men
               in good health under the most trying conditions; of their foibles and strength; their
               good times, hard times and sickness. Always apparent is the concern of the whole
               party to make the objects of the expedition a success. That this was accomplished at
               a considerable risk of life is evident by the continual detailing of a few men who
               were sent ahead, or remained behind, the main party, to secure food for the command's
               sustenance.</p>
            <p>Where one journal may state "sent out 5 hunters," from another I have obtained the
               names of the men, and have inserted their names when found, into the text. In those
               entries where no names are given, it is because no journal records them. In several
               cases I have found that the various journals do not always agree on the events of a
               given day. It is to be remembered that frequently these journals were written days
               after the event had occurred. I have had to select that which seemed to be the
               accurate description. I have also incorporated into the text, for the convenience of
               the reader, modern names of rivers, and the full names of traders—with a brief
               identification taken from other sources.</p>
            <p>In view of this "Diary" being a composite of several writers, I have not felt it
               necessarry to retain their spelling and punctuation. In those cases where I have
               added material not found in the journal of a member, I have enclosed such matter in
               [brackets] and have given a citation to its source. </p>
            <p> Let us return to St. Charles and begin the "Diary" on the day the expedition left
               that village.</p>

               <p>All the fore-part of the day we were arranging our party and preparing the
                  different articles necessary here at St. Charles. We set out at half past three in
                  the afternoon, under three cheers from the gentlemen on the bank, and proceeded on
                  to the head of an island. We left four of our Frenchmen in St. Charles to finish
                  their business. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George

               <p>We delayed an hour for the return of the Frenchmen whom we had left at St.
                  Charles. Reuben and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>
                  were sent ahead to the settlement of Daniel Boone to purchase some corn and
                  butter. At 6 a.m. we proceeded on, and later camped at the mouth of a small creek.
                  Soon after we came to, some Indians arrived with four deer as a present. We gave
                  them two quarts of whiskey.</p>

               <p>We set out early and later passed an American settlement where we took in Reuben
                  and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> who had been sent
                  yesterday to purchase some corn and butter. Many people came to see us. We
                  proceeded on, and stopped at a large cave called "The Tavern." <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, who had been walking along the
                  river, ascended the cliffs over-hanging the waters of the river. He slipped and
                  fell down the rocks for some two hundred feet. Fortunately for his life, he caught
                  himself at twenty feet, and with his knife, he dug in and saved himself. It was a
                  very narrow escape.</p>

               <p>We set out early and passed a very bad part of the river called "The Devil's
                  Raceground." We hove to near the head of a sand-bar. The swiftness of the current
                  wheeled the keel-boat; broke the tow-rope, and was near to over-setting the boat.
                  All hands jumped out, and by the means of swimmers, we got a rope fast to the
                  stern. We were near lost as the boat wheeled a third time before we got her to
                  shore. At this place George <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Alexander

               <p>We set out early as usual, and enroute we met Mr. Regis <name type="person" key="Loisel, Régis">Loisel</name>, a St. Louis merchant, on his way down
                  from Cedar Island. He gave us much information in regard to the Indians up river.
                  We passed St. Johns, [La Charette] a poor village— the last white settlement
                  on the Missouri River. The People gave us milk and butter.</p>

               <p>While passing through a narrow pass between an island and the main river, the men
                  had trouble with moving sand-bars. The current was swift and the river banks were
                  undercut, and they were caving down into the river. The boat wheeled so rapidly
                  that the men were almost swept off their feet. The active exertions of the men
                  prevented the boat from turning and being capsized. Again <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had cause to appreciate his men: "We
                  saved her by some extraordinary exertions of our party who are ever ready to
                  encounter the fatigues for the promotion of the enterprise." <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, while hunting, found a small lake
                  where many deer were feeding. He heard in this pond a snake making gobbling noises
                  like a turkey. When he fired his gun, the noise was increased. [This happened on
                  present Wakenda Creek, <name type="person" key="Cann, E.">Carr</name>ol County,
                  Missouri.]</p>

               <p>The wind was from the S.E., so the party crowded sail and we made sixteen miles.
                  We nooned at a former Indian settlement. The hunters came in with four bears and
                  three deer. So we celebrated with a dram of whisky—and then rowed on.</p>

               <p>Our flotilla pressed on upstream, and after a short distance we arrived at the
                  river-bank camp of our hunting party. Here more game to feed our hard-working
                  rowers was obtained. After a hard day of rowing, our party camped in a bad place
                  where the mosquitoes and ticks were numerous.</p>

               <p>Some of the men with Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> looked for ash timber to make oars. They got enough to make
                  twenty oars. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and
                  another hunter came in with more game, and also a young horse they had found in
                  the prairie. Our party is afflicted with boils, and several have dysentery, which
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> attributes to the
                  muddy water of the river. The boats were moved against the river by several
                  methods. With a fair wind, the sails were used. With insufficient wind, the oars
                  were used, and in narrow places with shallow water, poles were employed. Soldiers
                  on both sides of the keel-boat, facing the stem, placed their poles in the bed of
                  the stream and the first in line walked aft, pushing on the pole; the next in line
                  followed in order, while those who had completed their maneuver, returned to the
                  bow to fall in line again. Where the current was too swift and the river too deep
                  for the poles, cordelling was resorted to. The rope was passed to men pulling from
                  the shore, and the steersmen kept the rudder set so as to keep the craft from
                  being pulled towards shore. All this was hard work, and the French engages
                  complained for the want of food — saying they were accustomed to five or six
                  meals a day. The captains roughly rebuked them for this presumption, for the other
                  men seemed to manage well.</p>

                  strong current, so they had to jump into the river and push their boat along. The

                  This caused the men to have to leap into the river to hold the boats in the wind.

               <p>Three hunters went out this morning to inspect the traps set last night. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a very fat
                  buck. Joseph and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s
                  returned without the horses, but with a small beaver. A party of three, with one
                  of the Fields brothers, was sent out to find the horses. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name> has been very sick for several days but is
                  now feeling some better. He says he has recovered his health again. Joseph Barter
                  has not returned with the Indian party, but it may be that they are so scattered
                  that it takes time to get them ready to come. We wait for them.</p>

               <p>We sent <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and two men
                  to look for the horses and one man back to where Joseph Barter was sent to find

                  we left them on the 28th of July. The horses were found twelve miles off. John
                  Shields brought in a deer, and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George
                     Shannon</name> brought in the skin, tallow and some of the meat of a fat buck

                  thirty- four years old today, so the men had a celebration of a dinner of fat

                  raspberries, currants and grapes of superior quality. The Indians have not yet
                  arrived, but a very ornate peace-pipe has been prepared for their reception.</p>

                  bow gun was fired in honor of the occasion. We learned that our man, Joseph

                  have become lost and will soon return [but they never saw him again]. With these

                  with our speech, and appeared glad that they were freed from their former powers.
                  They made sensible speeches and drank with us. The air gun was fired which

                  of ballast. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name> went
                  out to hunt and got lost. We sent a man to look for him. They joined us late in
                  the evening. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> and
                  another man who are with the horses, did not join us today. Mr. Dorion reports
                  that the Great <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> River
                  is navigable upwards of two hundred miles, and near its headwaters there is a
                  place where pipe-stone is found where the Indians make their peace-pipes. This is
                  a sacred ground among the Indians, and even tribes at war may meet here without
                  hostility. We gave to Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> the things that belonged to Sgt. <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>, for he is his nearest relative, except his
                  shot-pouch and tomahawk which we will send back to his parents in Kentucky.</p>

               <p>We set out early. At three miles we landed at a bluff where <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> and another man who had gone with the
                  horses, were waiting with two deer. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> examined the bluff which contained alum, copperas, cobalt
                  and pyrites. In testing the quality of these minerals, Capt. Lewis nearly poisoned
                  himself from the fumes and taste of the cobalt and pyrites which contained
                  arsenic. These minerals floating on the surface of the Missouri may be the cause
                  of the stomach disorders with which the party has been much afflicted since we
                  left the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> River.
                  Henceforth, we were ordered to dip our drinking water at some depth in order to
                  avoid the scum on the surface. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> took a dose of salts to work off the effects of the arsenic. We
                  permitted the men to name their man as a candidate for a new sergeant to replace
                  the late Sgt. <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Alexander Willard</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">George Gibson</name> were nominated. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name> received nineteen votes, the highest
                  number cast. Last night in <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name>'s sleep the name of Rolojo came to him, and as he is hard pressed
                  to think up names to give the numerous streams we pass, he gave that name to a
                  creek we passed today. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> caught a beaver. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George

                  and ten other men were sent to butcher it, and brought the meat back to the boat.
                  This was our first buffalo. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">John
                     Collins</name> killed a deer. We salted two barrels of the buffalo meat and

                  shot an elk standing on a sand-bar. AUGUST 24. We passed some blue clay bluffs
                  which appear to have been lately on fire, and are now too hot for a man to bear
                  his hand in the earth at any depth. We found buffalo-berries which are deliciously
                  flavored and made delightful tarts. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name>, <name type="person" key="York">York</name> and a Frenchman,
                  walked on shore where they killed two bucks and a fawn which we put in the boat
                  before a rain set in. The two captains walked on shore again, and got very wet,
                  while they shot two elk and visited a high hill, believed by the Indians to be a
                  place of devils and evil spirits.</p>

                  "Mountain of Evil Spirits." The Indians had told us there were little men eighteen
                  inches tall, with big heads and armed with sharp arrows, at this place. Capt.
                  Lewis became very tired and dropped out. When we descended at evening, <name type="person" key="York">York</name> was nearly exhausted by the heat, thirst
                  and fatigue. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> said this
                  is because <name type="person" key="York">York</name> is too fat and unaccustomed
                  to walk so fast. We set fire to the prairie at two places to let the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> know we are on the river.
                  The boat party under Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> also fired the prairie near them. As it began to rain, the
                  mountain party camped out all night. Meanwhile, Reuben Fields brought in five deer

               <p>The land party rejoined the boats at 9 o'clock a.m. We jerked the meat killed
                  yesterday, and prepared the elk skins to make rope. We set out, leaving <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> to hunt our lost horses
                  — with directions to follow us, keeping on the high land. The captains

                  integrity of Sergeant <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>. Great

               <p>Twelve fine catfish were caught last night. This morning <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> called from shore, and a pirogue was
                  sent over for him. He had not found the horses, nor <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph
                     Fields</name> were sent out to find <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and the horses. While we were at the mouth of James River, an
                  Indian boy swam to the boat. He was of the <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name> nation. He told us there was a <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> camp near. Two other
                  Indians joined us when we landed, and Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and Mr. Dorion went with the last two
                  Indians to their camp to invite them to visit us. The Indian boy stayed with us
                  all night.</p>

               <p>We went up the river for six miles where the Indian boy left us. He returned to
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. Captains Lewis
                  and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> are much indisposed.
                  They think it might be caused by some hominy they ate. The large red pirogue ran a
                  snag through her bottom and was near sinking. We formed a camp on a beautiful
                  plain. The pirogue was unloaded and some of the baggage was found to be damaged.
                  The captains are still thinking of sending one of the pirogues back to St. Louis.
                  The Fields brothers, who were sent to look for <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and the horses, joined us and informed us
                  that they could not overtake him. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, not being a first-rate hunter, made us determined to send
                     <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> in pursuit of him
                  with some provisions. We raised a flag pole over our camp, expecting the

               <p>In the afternoon, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and Old Dorion, with his son, Pierre Jr., who happened to be
                  trading with the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>,
                  arrived and brought with them sixty Indians of the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> nation. They appear to be friendly and camped
                  on the opposite shore. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and young Dorion carried over to them some hominy, kettles,
                  tobacco, etc. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>
                  anxiously reported that the women in the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> village are mostly old and homely <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a deer, and we
                  caught many large catfish. The pirogue was repaired, and she was reloaded. The men
                  are making a tow-line out of the green elk hides. When Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> first found the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> camp they presented him
                  and his party with a fat dog, already cooked, of which they heartily partook and
                  found well flavored. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  is engaged in writing a speech, as the Indians are to meet with us tomorrow. The
                  young warriors had killed two elk and six deer enroute, which they use to feed
                  themselves.</p>

               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">UGUST</hi> 30.</head>
               <p>We prepared some presents and medals which we intend to give to the Indians. We
                  sent Old Dorion over in a pirogue for the chiefs and warriors to bring them to our
                  council. At 12 o'clock we met, and Capt. Lewis delivered a speech in which he
                  explained the change in government, enjoined them to make peace, and invited them
                  to send a chief to our President in Washington to receive his good counsel. We
                  smoked the pipe-of- peace and gave them presents of clothes, tobacco, a flag,
                  medals, cockedhats and uniforms. The chiefs retired to divide their presents,
                  while Captains Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
                  went to dinner and to consult about other matters. Old Dorion was displeased that
                  he was not invited to have dinner with them, and the captains were sorry that they
                  had overlooked inviting him. The air gun was fired, and it was explained that this
                  gun was our great medicine, and that the gun could do great harm. After a few
                  firings, the Indians ran to the trees to see the holes the shots had made, and
                  they shouted aloud at the execution this gun could do. At night a circle was
                  formed about the camp fires. The chiefs looked on with great dignity while the
                  warriors danced until late at night. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> have
                  not yet returned.</p>

               <p>The Indians remained with us all day. They want Old Dorion and his son to stay
                  with them so that he could accompany their chief to Washington. The chiefs
                  returned a speech with an eloquent account of their dire poverty, etc. They said
                  they would make peace with the Pawnee and <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>, and said one of them would visit our
                  President next spring. They also wished the captains would give them something for
                  their squaws. The captains told them we were not traders, but had only come to
                  make the road open for the traders who would follow, and who would supply their
                  wants at better terms than they had ever had before. We learned much of their
                  habits and customs, which we collect for our Government. The captains gave them
                  more tobacco and corn to take to their lodges. We commissioned Old Dorion to make
                  peace with all the chief nations in the neighborhood. We gave him a flag and some
                  clothes. He received this with pleasure and promised to do all that was necessary.
                  The chiefs sent their young men home, while they stayed to wait for Mr. Dorion. We
                  gave Dorion a bottle of whiskey, and he and his son — with the chiefs
                  — crossed to the other side of the river to camp.</p>

                  him. We then set out on our journey and came to a beaver house. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a buck elk. It

               <p>Shields killed a strange animal we call a barking squirrel [prairie dog]. We
                  halted and the captains went out with ten men. By pouring water into the animals'

                  vessels and kettles that would hold water in order to drive the animals from their
                  holes. Though they worked at this business until night, they caught only one.

                  without provisions, subsisting on grapes and one rabbit. One of his horses gave

               <p>We set out early. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s
                  went to hunt and returned later in the day with a wild goat. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked on shore and observed great
                  herds of buffalo, and a great fire on the plains to the south. This is taken to
                  mean that Indians have discovered us. We name a creek "Reuben" because he was the
                  first of our party to reach it. In the evening three boys of the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> nation swam across the
                  river and informed us that two parties of <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> were camped on the next river. We treated them
                  kindly and sent them back with an invitation to a conference in the morning.</p>

               <p>We found the camp of <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> who
                  had killed four elk. We prepared some clothes and a few medals for the chiefs we
                  expect to meet at the next river. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> ran to the bank and reported that some Indians had taken his
                  horse, bridle and some salt from him. We saw five Indians who demanded to come
                  aboard. We told them that we were friends and wished to remain so, but that we
                  were not afraid of any Indians. We told them that some of their men had stolen a
                  horse sent by their Great Father, and that we would not speak to them any more
                  until the horse was returned to us. We proceeded on to the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name> River. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> went on shore and smoked
                  with a chief who had come to see us here. He said he knew nothing of the horse,
                  etc. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> informed him that
                  we would hold a council tomorrow. Peter Cruzatte could only speak <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>, so we were only partly
                  understood by these <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>.
                  Old Dorion, who could speak this language is not with us anymore, for we had left
                  him below. Everyone remained on board all night — on the alert for any
                  trouble.</p>

               <p>We raised a flag pole over our camp and put up an awning and a sand-bar in
                  readiness for the Indians. At 10 o'clock they came — about fifty in number.
                  We gave them food and tobacco. They have some captive <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name> squaws, so Cruzatte could talk to them, and
                  they in return, translated into <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. The captains in this manner delivered a speech, gave medals and
                  presents of knives, clothes, a cocked-hat, and other small articles. We paraded
                  our party and invited the chiefs on board the boat. There we showed them many
                  curiosities and gave them a half wine glass of whiskey. They took up an empty
                  bottle and soon began to be troublesome. One of them, "The <name type="person" key="Partisan">Partisan</name>," pretended to be drunk and reeled about the
                  boat. With some difficulty, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> took the other chiefs ashore and tried to reconcile them, but as
                  he landed, three warriors seized the cable. The chief who affected drunkenness was
                  exceedingly insolent both in words and gestures, saying we could not depart. He
                  said that they were poor and would keep our pirogue, and that they had soldiers as
                  well as we. Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, in
                  moderation, told them we had a long way to go — and would go — and
                  that we were not squaws, but soldiers. The chief's insults became so personal, and
                  his intentions so evident to do us injury, that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> at last drew his sword, and at this
                  motion, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> ordered the
                  men in the boat under arms. The large swivel gun was loaded with buck-shot. The
                  five men who were with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  had previously taken up their guns with full determination to defend him if
                  necessary. The Grand Chief, "<name type="person" key="Black Buffalo">Black
                     Buffalo</name>," then took hold of the cable and sent the young warriors off,
                  and the lesser chiefs went to the Indian party about twenty yards back. All of
                  them had their bows strung and guns cocked. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> felt warm and spoke in positive terms
                  to them all, but principally to the First Chief. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> offered him his hand, but the chief
                  refused it — but let the rope go and went to his party. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> pushed the pirogue off and had not gone
                  far when the First Chief and three principal men walked into the water and
                  requested to come on board. They were taken in and we proceeded about a mile and
                  anchored near a small island which <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> named "Bad Humored Island." The four Indians stayed with us all
                  night.</p>

               <p>We set out early but soon came to to let the squaws and boys see the boat as the
                  chiefs had requested. Great numbers of men, women and children were on the banks
                  watching us. They are fond of dress and show, and appeared spritely, but generally
                  ill looking. After landing, Capt. Lewis and five men, including <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>, went on shore with
                  the chief who appeared to want to make up and be friendly. After <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> had been on shore
                  about three hours, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  became uneasy for fear of deception, and sent a sergeant to see him. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> reported all was well
                  and that the Indians wanted us to remain one more night so that they could show
                  their good disposition towards us — so we determined to remain. After <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> returned to the boat,
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> went on shore. He
                  was received on an elegant buffalo robe and was carried to the village by six
                  warriors and was not permitted to touch the ground until he was put down in the
                  grand council house on a white, dressed robe. Under this shelter, about seventy
                  men sat in a circle and the pipe-of-peace was smoked. A large fire was near in
                  which food was cooking. Soon after they sat <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> down, the warriors went for <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and they brought him
                  back in the same manner. An old man arose and spoke in approval of what we had
                  done, and informed us of their situation, requesting us to take pity on them. We
                  told him the Great Father wanted his children to live in peace and that he would
                  want them to give up the <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name> prisoners and make peace with that nation. After much talk, the
                  Great Chief then rose and with great state he spoke to the same purpose. With
                  great solemnity he took up the pipe-of-peace, lit it, and presented the stem to us
                  to smoke. He took some of the most delicate parts of the dog which had been
                  prepared for the feast, and made an offering to the flag to acknowledge transfer
                  of the country. We smoked for an hour until dark when all was cleared away. A
                  large fire was made in the center and about ten musicians beat on tambourines. Men
                  and women came on highly decorated and proceeded to dance the War Dance. They did
                  this with great cheerfulness until about midnight, when we informed the chiefs
                  that they must be tired. Accompanied by four chiefs, we returned to the boat, and
                  they stayed with us all night. They promise to deliver the prisoners to Mr.
                  Dorion. All of our men are on board, anchored about one hundred paces from shore.
                  Everyone is in high spirits this evening [Nothing is mentioned about the recovery
                  of the horse].</p>

               <p>The bank was lined with <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. We gave the two principal chiefs a blanket and a peck of corn
                  each. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> accompanied
                  the chiefs to their lodges. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> wrote a. letter to Mr. Dorion and prepared some ccmmissions and a
                  medal, and sent them to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name>. At 2 o'clock <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> returned with four chiefs and a brave man which they call a sort
                  of police. After a half an hour, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name>, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and
                  others took them on shore and they left us with reluctance, but we are still alert
                  for any treachery. They offered the captains a young woman for companionship,
                  which was refused. At dark the dance was begun as usual, performed as last night.
                  About 11 p.m., we returned to the boats with two chiefs, but by bad steering, the
                  pirogue struck the keel-boat's cable with such force as to break it near the
                  anchor. The chiefs became frightened and alarmed, and the Indians came down in
                  great haste, armed for action. They found the incident harmless, but about twenty
                  of them camped on shore all night. As we had lost our anchor, we were obliged to
                  lay to under a bank much exposed to the hostile intentions of these <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> whom we had every
                  reason to believe intended to stop our boats and rob us. Peter Cruzatte came in at
                  night and informed us that the <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name> prisoners told him that the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> intended to stop us. Under Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, a guard was kept all night, but
                  we showed no sign of our knowledge of these evil intentions.</p>

               <head>S<hi rend="smallcaps">EPTEMBER</hi> 28.</head>
               <p>We made many diligent attempts to find our anchor without success, for the sand
                  had covered it up. We were determined to proceed, and after breakfast we, with
                  great difficulty, got all the chiefs but the First Chief, out of the boat. When we
                  were about setting out, the Indian soldiers took possession of the cable. <name type="person" key="Black Buffalo">Black Buffalo</name>, who was still aboard,
                  was informed of this. He went to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name>, who was at the bow, and told him the warriors wanted tobacco.
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was nearing
                  giving orders to cut the rope and fire on them. He said to the chief : "You told
                  us you are a great man and have influence; now show your influence by taking the
                  rope from these men." This appealed to his pride and had the desired effect. We
                  gave a twist of tobacco to the First Chief who gave it to his men. The chief took
                  the cable from them and gave it to us. We proceeded under a favorable breeze. We
                  took in the Number Three Chief who was waiting two miles above. He told us that
                  the Number Two Chief, the one who had pretended drunkenness, was a double-spoken
                  man. Soon afterward, we saw a man riding full speed up the bank. We brought him
                  aboard, and later sent him back with a talk for his nation, i.e. — if they
                  were for peace, they were to stay at home–and if they were for war, or
                  determined to stop us — then we were ready to defend ourselves. We
                  substituted large stones for an anchor, and stopped at a small island in the
                  middle of the river. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  feels unwell from all the tension and lack of sleep. Under the circumstances,
                  everyone stayed aboard the boats.</p>

               <p>We set out early. At 9 a.m., we observed the Number Two Chief and three men and
                  two squaws on shore. They wanted to come on board, but we refused to let any more
                  sail with us. They offered us the squaws but we told them that we would not speak
                  to another <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
                  except the one on board — and he could go ashore anytime he pleased. We
                  proceeded on until evening, the Indians still following — when our chief
                  requested to be put ashore — which we did. We later camped on the south side
                  of the river.</p>

               <p>We had not proceeded far when we discovered at a distance a great number of men,
                  women and children descending the banks towards the river, above which the chief
                  told us there was another band of <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> of about four hundred souls. About 10 a.m., we anchored opposite
                  the camps of this band. We told them that we took them by the hand as friends. As
                  a token of this we would send to each chief a twist of tobacco, and some to the
                  principal men. We also said we had been badly treated by the band below, and would
                  not land again, as we had not time to delay. They wanted us to eat with them, but
                  we declined, and proceeded under a double-reefed sail. The chief on board tossed
                  to those who ran along the shore small pieces of tobacco and told them to open
                  their ears to our councils. About 4 p.m., we went to shore to take on some
                  fire-wood. When we put off, the stern got fast. The boat swam around in the
                  stream, and as the wind was high, she got in the trough of the waves and rocked
                  very much before we got her straightened out. The chief on board was very much
                  afraid and ran and hid himself. He said our boat was bad medicine and, would not
                  go further with us. Our captains gave him a blanket, knife, some tobacco and put
                  him on shore. We told him to keep his men away from us. We camped on a sand-bar,
                  everyone on guard.</p>

               <p>We passed the Cheyenne River. The Missouri is filled with sand-bars and we were
                  obliged to haul the keel-boat over one. We saw a man whom we discovered to be a
                  Frenchman. He was recognized by one of our engages. We brought him over to the
                  boat in one of the pirogues. We then came to a trading post where Mr. Jean Valle
                  and two men kept a few goods to trade with the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. Mr. Valle gave us information of the Cheyenne
                  Indians and the interior country.</p>

               <p>Mr. Valle came on board, and could speak English. He said we would not be troubled
                  by any more <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. He came a
                  short distance with us, and then returned to his post. We proceeded on. In the
                  afternoon we discovered some Indians on the hills, and one of them came down to
                  the river. He told us he wanted us to come ashore. We told him we had spoken to
                  his chief — and proceeded on. We expected to be attacked around the next
                  bend — and were ready for them. Nothing happened, so we went on. We camped
                  on a sand bar, one half mile from shore. There was no hunting today for the
                  Indians are troublesome, so we are forced to keep the company together and be on
                  the alert.</p>

               <p>We set out early. At noon we examined our stores. Several bags had been cut into
                  by mice and some corn was scattered. Some of the cloths and paper were cut also.
                  At 1 o'clock an Indian came with a turkey on his back, and four others joined him.
                  We had no intercourse with them. We saw gulls and white brant flying to the
                  southward in large flocks. We camped on the south side of the river.</p>

               <p>As there was no outlet in the channel before us, we had to drop back three miles
                  to get into the proper channel. We saw several Indians on the bank and they yelled
                  and skipped a ball before us. One swam to us and begged for powder. We gave him a
                  small piece of tobacco and told him we were not traders but were a government
                  party strong enough to defend ourselves. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and three men walked along a large
                  island in the center of which is an old village of the Arikara. It appears to have
                  been deserted for about five years. We camped on a sand-bar at the upper end of
                  this island.</p>

                  Indians. They asked for, and we gave them meat to eat. We passed an island and
                  Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and three men hunted on it. One

                  above. We passed this village in the presence of a great number of spectators, and
                  camped above it at the foot of some high land. Mr. <name type="person" key="Gravelines, Joseph">Joseph Gravelines</name>, a French interpreter, joined

               <p>We delayed here all day among these friendly Indians. They use the bull-boat; a
                  frame of boughs made in the shape of a bowl, which is covered with a single
                  buffalo hide. These boats can carry from three to six men, and can ride the
                  highest waves. This nation had never seen a black man before and were much
                  astonished with <name type="person" key="York">York</name>. They call him "The Big
                  Medicine." By way of amusement, he told them that he had once been a wild animal,
                  but was caught and tamed by his master, and to convince them (for he is a
                  remarkably stout, strong negro), he showed them feats of strength, which, added to
                  his looks, made him more terrible than we wished him to be. He told them that
                  children were very good to eat. It was a cold, blustery day, but some of the men
                  went to the village.</p>

                  Mr. <name type="person" key="Tabeau, Pierre-Antoine">Tabeau</name> to invite the
                  chiefs to a conference. At 1 o'clock, the chiefs assembled at our camp under an
                  awning. We delivered a speech similar to that given to the tribes below and gave
                  them flags, medals, cloth, paints, etc. After the council, we shot the air gun
                  which astonished them. We observed two of the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> in our council whom we had seen below. We were
                  told they came to intercede with the Arikara to stop us. These Indians are not
                  fond of liquor of any kind, and were surprised that our Great White Father would
                  present them with a liquor that would make them foolish. Sgts. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> visited the village. They raise corn, beans, pumpkins, squash,
                  watermelons and a kind of tobacco. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> observes that this tobacco answers for smoking, but not for
                  chewing. We left one of our Frenchmen [<name type="person" key="Collin, Joseph">Joseph Collin</name> ?] with Mr. <name type="person" key="Tabeau, Pierre-Antoine">Tabeau</name> and took <name type="person" key="Tabeau, Pierre-Antoine">Tabeau</name>'s son in his place. They gave us
                  corn, beans, dried pumpkins and squash. Some of their women are very handsome and
                  clean. We set our corn-mill up and showed them how it operated.</p>

               <p>At 1 o'clock a.m. we met again in council. The chiefs thanked us for what we had
                  given them, and promised to follow our advice. They asked that we make peace with
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> nation above.
                  The chief told us the road was open for us and no one would dare shut it. We took
                  the Grand Chief and his nephew on board and set out for the upper village.
                  Enroute, we picked up another chief. This second village gave us corn and beans
                  — the last a well flavored bean which they rob from the nests of mice. we
                  gave them a steel mill which pleased them. Although an axe was stolen from our
                  cooks, all else is tranquility.</p>

               <p>We proceeded to the first village where ceremonies as before were repeated. They
                  wanted us to take one of their chiefs up to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> nation to make peace. The chief and his
                  people gave us about seven bushels of corn, some tobacco, seeds, leggins and a
                  robe. We continued on to another village where ten bushels of corn, summer squash
                  and beans were given us. We gave them sugar, salt and a sun-glass each. One of
                  them went with us to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>. They have an unusual custom of showing appreciation. They
                  think they cannot show sufficient acknowledgment without offering their guests
                  their handsome squaws. They are displeased if the squaws are not received. The
                  squaws are very insistent about it and followed us to our camp. Our men found no
                  difficulty in procuring companions for the night. <name type="person" key="York">York</name> participated in these favors, for the maidens desired to preserve
                  among them some living memorial of this wonderful stranger. An Arikara invited him
                  to his lodge and presented his wife to him, and retired outside the lodge. One of
                     <name type="person" key="York">York</name>'s comrades came looking for him, but
                  the gallant husband would permit no interruption until a reasonable time had
                  elapsed. Our men traded small articles for buffalo robes. We set off with fiddles
                  playing and horns sounding. <name type="person" key="Newman, John">John

               <p>We proceeded on. At noon we halted and a court-martial was held for two hours.
                  Nine of the men served on the jury: Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>, Joseph <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>, <name type="person" key="Werner, William">William Werner</name>, William <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Silas Goodrich</name>. <name type="person" key="Newman, John">John Newman</name> was sentenced to receive seventy-five
                  lashes on the bare back and to be henceforth discarded from the permanent party
                  engaged in the Northwest discovery. He is relieved from guard duty, but instead
                  shall be exposed to such drudgery as we think proper. We sent out hunters and they
                  returned with one deer. We found more grapes here than any we had yet seen.

                  caused the chief who was with us to Cry until the reason was explained to him. The
                  chief observed that such things were necessary, but that he punished such
                  disloyalty by death, for his nation never whipped anyone, even their children.</p>

               <p>We set out early and later stopped at a chief's lodge. Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> smoked with him, but could not eat because of
                  the rheumatism in his neck. This displeased the Indians somewhat. Here he met Mr.
                  Rene <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name>, a free trader
                  working out from the North West Company's posts on the <name type="native_nation" key="Assiniboine Indians">Assiniboine</name> River.<ref target="nch0501" n="1"/> His wife was a <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>
                  woman. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> employed him to
                  interpret for us, and he went along with us. We proceeded on to a central point
                  opposite the Knife River and formed a camp, and raised a flag staff. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name> walked down to the
                  second village of <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>.
                  We sent three carrots of tobacco to the chiefs and invited them to council with us
                  tomorrow. We are 1610 miles from the River du Bois, where we first embarked on
                  this expedition.</p>

               <p>Many of the Minnitaree nation from further up the Missouri, as well as the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, came to see us, but
                  the high wind today prevented us from holding a council. They wished to see the
                  keel-boat, because it was strange and mysterious to them, they viewed as great
                  medicine — as they also did <name type="person" key="York">York</name>. The
                  Grand Chief of the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>,
                  "Black Cat," with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>,
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and an interpreter,
                  walked up the river about a mile and a half to view conditions there as a fort for
                  ourselves. We found the situation good, but timber there is scarce. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> caught two beaver
                  above our camp last night. The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> women sent us presents of corn, hominy and garden stuffs. The
                  captains presented to the chief's wife an earthenware glazed jar, and she received
                  it with great pleasure. Our men are very cheerful this evening.</p>

               <p>We met in council under an awning with the sails from the boat stretched around to
                  keep out as much wind as possible. In our speech, we mentioned friendship and
                  trade, and the offer of peace from the Arikara. They all smoked the peace pipe
                  with the Arikara chief. We told them that some of our party would be discharged
                  here, and also spoke of the robbery they had committed on the two Frenchmen from
                  below. They are to answer us tomorrow. We gave them presents of suits of clothes.
                  The air gun was fired and we gave them a steel corn-mill which was very pleasing
                  to them. The prairie got on fire with such speed and violence that a man and a
                  woman were burned to death. A small half-breed boy was saved by crawling under a
                  fresh buffalo skin. The fire passed our camp at 8 p.m., and was truly
                  tremendous.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> took eight men in the

                  another site where there was wood and game. On the return to camp, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> gave the men a dram. The

                  The latter concurred in the benefits of peace, etc., but wanted more presents. Two
                  of the traps stolen from the Frenchmen were laid before <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>. In the evening the chief, dressed in
                  his new uniform and cocked-hat, visited our camp. Our men danced until 10 p.m.,
                  which is common with them when not rowing all day. Mr. Hugh McCraken, the British
                  trader, returned to his post which is about 150 miles from here. He took a letter
                  from our captains expressing cordial relations and good will to all persons at

               <p> We were visited by the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chiefs who were concerned as to where we would locate this
                  winter, for they knew, as we did, that we would have to be supplied with food

                  etc. The promised corn was not ready, but they told us we could have it tomorrow,
                  so we dropped down the river some nine miles to a bottom covered with timber where
                  we went into camp on the north side of the Missouri River.</p>

                  men worked diligently. The Arikara chief who had come with us, desired to return
                  to his home. He set out with a chief of the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>.

                  to the village where eleven bushels of corn were delivered. One of our French

               <p>We dispatched six hunters down the river to hunt. We discharged the nine French

                  were not discharged.]</p>
               <p>Two or three volunteered to remain with us during the winter. Two Frenchmen, who
                  together with two others, have established a small hut and resided within the
                  vicinity of Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>
                  under our protection. [These could be <name type="person" key="Deschamps, Jean Baptiste">Dechamp</name>s, Malboeuf, Carson and Rivet.]
                  The others are building a pirogue to return to St. Louis. [They apparently changed
                  their minds and remained, although two of these did go down the river to trap
                  until November 14, 1804, when they returned to Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Rene <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name>, his wife
                  and child, moved to our camp. Six men went in a pirogue down the river some twenty
                  or thirty miles to the good hunting grounds in order to obtain meat for our party.
                  We caught two beaver near camp. Jean Baptiste <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name>, a French-Canadian trapper who lives
                  here among the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, was
                  engaged to join our party in the place of <name type="person" key="Newman, John">John Newman</name>. He had trapped the upper Missouri, so we thought this
                  experience would be of much value to us. Some of the squaws came from the village
                  bringing meat. The men are busy building cabins.</p>

                  labors on the fort. The timber we use is very large and heavy — and is
                  mostly cottonwood with elm and some ash of inferior size. We got one line of our
                  cabins raised, and got the eave-beams raised on all. These eaves were large
                  timbers, and it took all the men with much hard lifting, to put the sixteen-foot
                  beams in place.</p>

                  lay the loft, which we intend to cover with earth in order to make the cabins warm
                  and comfortable. We dug a vault [trench? — privy?] one hundred yards about
                  the huts in order to keep the place healthy. Late at night we were awakened by the

                  flying south, and the Missouri has frozen over an inch and a half thick. It was

                  on the inside, and covered over with a tarpaulin and earth. Chief Shahaka came
                  down to our camp and told us that buffalo were on the prairie. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and ten more men went out to hunt. They got

                  Cottonwood timber is our hope for making shakes to roof our buildings. We had to

                  split it. [Though not mentioned in their journals, the captains must have

                  who were dispatched yesterday, returned from the hunters camp which is about
                  thirty miles below. After an hour, we dispatched another Frenchman with orders to
                  the hunters to proceed back without delay through the floating ice to the fort. We
                  sent by him some tin to be put on the bow of the pirogue, and other parts exposed
                  to the ice. We also sent along a tow-rope. All other hands are working on the
                  cabins.</p>

               <p>We are engaged in finishing our cabins to make them more comfortable. Several
                  Indians visited us today, and one stayed all night. The Frenchman returned with a
                  fat elk. Fat meat is most welcome, for most of the game is very poor and lean at

                  have it stored in holes about the village. Mr. <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name> had been promised one hundred
                  bushels, but only got thirty. We had some misunderstanding about one of the squaws
                  who has been staying in the fort with one of the interpreter's wives. Her husband
                  beat and stabbed her, and was about to kill her. The husband said that she had
                  slept with Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, and if he
                  wanted her, he would give her to him. We directed Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> to give the man some presents, and further
                  ordered that no man of this party have any intercourse with this woman under
                  penalty of punishment. At this moment the Grand Chief, Black Cat, arrived and he
                  lectured the husband. The husband and wife went off, apparently dissatisfied.</p>

               <p>Several of the men are sick with bad colds. We finished the rope, and cover our
                  cabins with hewed puncheons. Our guard is reduced to a sergeant and three men, so
                  we are making progress on the fort. The cabins are built in two rows of four rooms
                  each, and are joined at a triangle at one end. When raised about seven feet high,
                  a floor of puncheons or split planks are laid, and covered with grass and clay
                  — over this, we have built a warm loft. The loft projects a foot over, and
                  the roofs are made shed fashion — raising from the inner side of the
                  triangle — making the outer wall about eighteen feet high. The part not
                  enclosed by the buildings, we intend to close with a high picket fence. In the
                  angle formed by the two rows of cabins, we have built two rooms, one for holding
                  provisions and stores, the other for a smoke house.</p>

                  this morning to go some twenty-four miles above to visit the Minnitaree in that
                  neighborhood. The six men went in a pirogue, while <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and the interpreters went by
                  horseback. Enroute, they met Francois-Antoine <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name>, a North West Company
                  trader. In a very friendly manner, Capt. Lewis invited Mr. <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> to visit with us at the
                  fort. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was surprised
                  to find that his intended host, "Horned Weasel," "was not at home," so he and his
                  party were obliged to find lodging elsewhere. These natives are accustomed to look
                  upon every white man as an inferior being. One chief admitted that he admired the
                  air gun, as it could discharge forty shots at one load, but he dreaded the magic
                  of its owners. He said, "Had I these white warriors on the upper plains, my young
                  men on horseback would soon do for them as they would do for so many wolves. There
                  are only two sensible men among them, the worker of iron and the mender of guns."

                  gave them presents and paid them particular attention — which pleased them
                  very much. As it happened, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.

                  of how we intended to join the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> and cut them off during the winter. Some circumstances we admit
                  gave force to these tales — our building a big fort — the interpreters
                  and their wives moving in with us at the fort, etc. Some of these tales had been
                  given them by the North West Co's. traders, such as Mr. Baptiste La France, who
                  has taken it upon himself to speak unfavorably about us. <ref target="nch0503" n="3"/> These chiefs said they were glad they had come to see us and hear our

               <p>Mr. <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name>
                  asked Charbonneau to come and help him interpret among the Minnitarees.
                  Charbonneau replied, that being engaged with us Americans, he could not do so
                  without the captain's permission. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> told Mr. <name type="person" key="Larocque, François-Antoine">Larocque</name> that he was willing for
                  Charbonneau to help him, provided he would not be caused to say anything to the

                  Our captains thought it wise to offer the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> assistance if they were disposed to fight
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, Charbonneau, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and twenty-two men volunteered,
                  and immediately set out with the intention of pursuing the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. They went up to the
                  first village, but the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> warriors did not seem disposed to turn out. They suggested that
                  the weather was too cold; the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> too far gone, etc., and put off the expedition until spring.
                  Therefore, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and the

                  after the gate was locked. Rather than call the guard to have it opened, he scaled
                  the works. An Indian, who had been looking on, followed his example. Howard was
                  committed to the guard. As he is an old soldier, this bad example heightens the
                  offense.</p>

                  Charbonneau returned with one of our Frenchmen and informed us that he had left
                  below three horses and two men with the meat, but the horses could not cross the
                  ice, not being shod.</p>

               <p>Six men were sent down the river with two sleds to bring up the meat. The horses
                  were brought back by land so they could be shod. <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, Charbonneau's wife, was delivered of a fine

                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> that the natives
                  administered a small portion of the rattle of the rattlesnake in such cases, which
                  hastened the birth of a child. This being the first birth of <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, and the labor tedious — the pain was
                  violent. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, having a
                  rattle near by, broke two rings in small pieces, which with some water, was given
                  to her. In ten minutes time, she brought forth, although <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was not sure that the rattle was the
                  remedy. The hunting party had killed much game, and had put the meat up on
                  scaffolds to keep it safe from the wolves.</p>

               <p>All of the party are engaged in cutting the ice from around the boats. By evening,
                  by hard cutting and use of pries, we got one pirogue loose and pulled it out and
                  turned it over on its side. We loosened the ice from around the other pirogue. The
                  father of the Indian boy whose foot had been so badly frozen, and which we had now

                  working, and after much difficulty, got the boat safe on the bank. This operation
                  attracted a great number of Indians who watched us. Some of the chiefs requested

                  us or not under the terms we have agreed on. </p>

               <p>Two of our men went up to the traders at the Gros Ventres to get some tobacco.
                  Charbonneau decided he will not go with us if he has to work, stand guard —
                  or if miffed at any man, he wishes to return if he pleases. Also he wants the
                  disposal of as much provisions as he chooses to carry. These terms are
                  inadmissable to us, so we suffer him to be off the engagement.</p>

                     Carson</name> and Peter Roi, seem to be the Frenchmen who returned to the
                  Arikara when the Frenchmen were discharged on November 2, 1804. Another Frenchman,
                  Grenier (Grienyea), though never a member of the party, was at Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> at different times
                  during the winter, and did come up with the expedition from the Arikara villages.
                  He may be one of the Frenchmen mentioned, along with Joseph Collin, as going back
                  and forth between Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> and the Arikara. It also appears that Grenier, Ross ("<name type="person" key="Roi, Peter">Rokey</name>") , and Francois Rivet returned to
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> in 1806, for
                  they seem to be the Frenchmen found there by the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> expedition when the permanent party returned
                  from the Pacific. These three, with Phillip Degie, had stayed with the Arikara at
                  least part of the winter of 1805–1806]</p>
               <p>[While no journals seem to have been kept by Cpl. Warfington nor any members of
                  his return party, we do know a few details of their voyage. After leaving Fort
                     <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>, they stopped at
                  the Arikara village and took aboard an Arikara chief and his party. Mr. <name type="person" key="Gravelines, Joseph">Joseph Gravelines</name> conducted the
                  chief to St. Louis and then on to Washington, where the chief died. Some of the
                  Frenchmen remained with the Arikara such as Francois Rivet, Phillipe Degie, "<name type="person" key="Roi, Peter">Rokey</name>" and possibly <name type="person" key="Collin, Joseph">Joseph Collin</name>. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> later reported that "<name type="person" key="Newman, John">John Newman</name> was extremely serviceable
                  as a hunter on the voyage to St. Louis, and that the boat, on several occasions,
                  owed her safety in a great measure, to his personal exertions, being a man of
                  uncommon activity and bodily strength." <ref target="nch0701" n="1"/>
               </p>
               <p>The party reached St. Louis on May 20, 1805, and turned the Indians, the reports,
                  letters and crates of natural history objects over to Charles Gratiot, who was
                  acting agent during the absence of <name type="person" key="Stoddard, Amos">Capt.
                     Amos Stoddard</name>. As the terms of enlistment for the soldiers entitled them
                  to discharge upon termination of the voyage, some of them returned to civilian
                  life. Others, such as <name type="person" key="Warfington, Richard">Richard
                     Warfington</name>, re-enlisted with their former units. They all had been

                        enlisted as an interpreter and engage on March 18, 1805. He had previously
                        been employed by the North West Company as a trader. He was verbose and
                        excitable. At one time he had lived among the Minnitaree where in 1794 he is
                        reported to have won <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> in

                        She had been captured by the Minnitaree when about 12 years old, and later

                        and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>. He was nicknamed
                           <name type="person" key="Jean Baptiste">Pomp</name> — meaning a
                        leader or head man — a title often given the first-born of a <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> mother.</p>
                     <p>About 1810, according to the promise given to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> by his parents, he was brought
                        down to St. Louis to be reared and educated by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. About 1821, Jean Baptiste apparently
                        entered the service of the Missouri Fur Company. In October, 1823, Prince
                        Paul, Duke of Wurttemberg— highly impressed with the outstanding young
                        man — took him to Germany for an education in Europe. In late 1829,
                        they returned to Missouri. Jean Baptiste went to the mountains, probably
                        with Drips and Fontenelle, in the spring of 1830. Then followed many years
                        in various capacities as a fur trapper-trader with several outfits. Later he
                        was an interpreter for Fremont, Emory, Abert and several others.</p>
                     <p>He is said to have worn his hair long, was the best man on foot on the
                        plains and mountains and an active and useful man. Several writers who met
                        him note his fine character, pleasant manners and particularly fine
                        education. He could converse in English, French, German, Spanish as well as
                        several Indian languages.</p>
                     <p>In 1846, <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Jean Baptiste">Jean Baptiste
                           Charbonneau</name> went to California as a guide for the Mormon Battalion
                        commanded by Philip St. George Cooke. Then he served as alcalde at the San
                        Luis Rey district of San Diego. When gold was discovered in northern
                        California, Jean Baptiste went up there to seek his fortune. With his old
                        friend, Jim Beckwourth, he mined on the Middle Fork of the American River
                        and at other places in Placer County for several wears — always
                        respected by the community. In 1866 he decided to go to the newly discovered
                        mines in Montana. Enroute, he died of pneumonia about the first of May,
                        1866, at Inskip's Ranch, located in the Jordan Valley of south-east Oregon.
                        He was aged sixty-one. Near the ranch are three old graves, one of them

               <p>We set out early. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  walked on shore and visited Black Cat. One of the canoes filled with water and its
                  loading got wet. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> went
                  back to lend assistance. We lost a half bag of biscuit and about thirty pounds of
                  gun powder. The powder was spread out to dry with the hope of restoring the
                  greater part of it. At the noon camp, an Indian came up with a woman who was
                  extremely solicitous of accompanying one of the men [<name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>?] of the party. This the captains refused to
                  permit. The Indian man, being acquainted with the upper Missouri, was allowed to
                  accompany us.</p>

               <p>We set out early and passed a hunting party of the Gros Ventres. The Indian man
                  who joined us yesterday, now informed us he would not continue with us, and
                  accordingly returned to his village. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked on shore today. When we halted for dinner, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> went out with a sharp stick
                  which she used to penetrate the holes of gophers. She collected and brought us a
                  quantity of wild artichokes, which the animals gather and hoard in large
                  quantities.</p>

               <p>At 1 p.m. we overtook three Frenchmen who had left the fort a few days before us
                  in order to make the first attempt on this river of trapping beaver. They mean to
                  accompany us up to the Yellowstone River for protection. [These could be Grenier,
                     <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name> and the
                  previously men tioned, Mr. Croix. However, this is pure speculation On my part,
                  and is Only offered as a clue. It would seem that if they were any of the former
                  members of the party, one of the journalists would have mentioned it.]</p>

                  breakfast, they brought a deer and two beaver, which was most acceptable, as we
                  have had no fresh meat for several days. We halted at 2 p.m., and had dinner on
                  venison, beaver tails and the biscuit which had got wet on the 8th. The powder
                  which was wet at that time appears to be almost restored. A beaver was caught by
                  one of the Frenchmen. We have now only four: Cruzatte, <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>, <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name> and Charbonneau. The latter is
                  usually at the helm of the large red pirogue. The day was warm and some of the men
                  worked almost naked except for a breech-cloth.</p>

                  swimming in the river. We arrived at the mouth of the Little Missouri River where
                  we halted while the captains made observations. <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name> tells us that this river is not
                  navigable. We have ten hunters out. They killed a deer, a white eagle and found
                  some wild onions. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  killed a white rabbit which is now changing its color to grey. We remained here
                  for the rest of the day to air our baggage. Several of the men have been cutting
                  into the bags of corn and parched meal.</p>

               <p>We hoisted the sails in the white pirogue and sailed under a favorable wind until
                  afternoon. About 2 p.m., a sudden squall struck and turned the pirogue so much on
                  its side, as to alarm Charbonneau who was steering. In his excitement, he threw
                  the pirogue into the wind, which nearly upset her. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> took the helm, and the sails were
                  taken in. This accident nearly cost us dearly, for all our instruments, medicine
                  and most valuable merchandise were aboard. We had thought that the largest pirogue
                  was the most steady and safe boat we had, hence the loading. Our party caught
                  eight beaver, and the three Frenchmen, seven, last evening. As there appeared to
                  be many beaver here, the three extra Frenchmen who were accompanying us, concluded
                  to remain here and not continue further with us. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked ashore to inspect the

                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> went out and in

                  ashore this morning. Three beaver were caught. The men prefer the flesh of this
                  animal, the tail and liver particularly. The elk and buffalo are so lean that we

               <p>We caught one beaver in two traps — it having a foot in each. The traps
                  belonged to different men, so a contest ensued which might have terminated in a
                  serious encounter had not the captains' timely arrival prevented it. The party had
                  to use the tow-lines today. A high wind came up in the afternoon. It was with
                  great difficulty that the canoes could be kept from filling with water. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, Charbonneau, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and infant, walked ashore. Two
                  men went up the river to set their beaver traps. They met a bear, and being
                  without arms, thought it best to return. One man killed a goose, and <name type="person" key="Seaman">Scannon</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' dog, brought it in to the boat.</p>

                  more plentiful and is much more tame here than below. Some of the men caught a

               <p>The wind was less severe than yesterday, so we set out before 7 a.m. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> walked on shore while

                  obtained three elk, four geese and two deer. The elk and deer are poor at this
                  season. The men's good health and appetite make up for the deficiency, and they
                  eat heartily of them. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> shot a beaver.</p>

                  buffalo, elk and antelope. They are so gentle that we pass near them, and
                  sometimes they approach us to determine who we are. The overland party encamped on

                  several hunters to scour the country, but they returned this evening, having seen
                  no smoke, tents nor recent tracks of Indians. Boils and abscesses are very common
                  among the party, and sore eyes continue with all of us. For the abscesses we use

               <p>Our men are hunting bears. This evening Charbonneau was at the helm of the white
                  pirogue instead of <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>,
                  who was ashore with the captains. Charbonneau cannot swim, and is perhaps the most
                  timid waterman in the world. In this pirogue were embarked our papers,
                  instruments, books, medicine and the greater part of our Indian goods. The pirogue
                  was under sail when a sudden squall of wind hit her, and Charbonneau, instead of
                  putting her before the wind, luffed her into it — and she went to one side.
                  Cruzatte gave orders repeatedly to take hold of the rudder, and at last Cruzatte
                  himself saved her. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  was in the act of attempting to swim to the pirogue, but realized the danger.

                  Our loss was not as great as we had first thought — the medicine suffered
                  the greatest injury. One of our party wounded a large Panther. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> killed an antelope. A grizzly

               <p>We have a clear, pleasant morning. The banks were firm which favored the use of
                  the tow-line. We find this the safest and most expeditious mode of traveling,

                  guard. A large tree which branched over the captain's tent had taken fire. We had
                  the tent removed and a few moments later a large proportion of the tree crashed
                  down on the place where the tent had just stood. The wind blew hard and spread the

               <p>We used the tow-line, only resorting to the oars when we had to pass the mouths of
                  rivers — thus taking advantage of the banks for pulling. We came to a creek
                  which we named "<name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>'s Creek"

                  first caught sight of a distant view of the Rocky Mountains — the object of

                  doubling the crews, and using both the ropes and poles, we ascended with great
                  difficulty. Capt. Lewis walked among the hills and killed a fat buffalo which we
                  are in want of.</p>

               <p>The wind blew hard, so we used the tow-lines most of the day. The country is bare
                  and desolate. We camped near two dead-topped cottonwood trees for the benefit of
                  the fire wood found there.</p>

                  floating poles and a football and other articles which indicate Indians are

               <p>Last night we were alarmed by a large buffalo bull which swam over from the
                  opposite side and clambered over the white pirogue in attempting to land. He then
                  ran full speed towards where the men were asleep, missing their heads by inches.
                  He then took a direction towards the captain's tent. <name type="person" key="Seaman">Scannon</name> chased him off. The camp was in an uproar, but no
                  one was hurt. In crossing the pirogue, the buffalo trod on <name type="person" key="York">York</name>'s rifle and bent it, and shattered the stock of a
                  blunderbuss. It seems to us that the white pirogue is attended by some evil genii,

               <p>It is cold and rainy today. We had great labor in towing the boats. Our lines made
                  of elk skin were worn, and broke several times, but fortunately without injury to
                  the boats. The banks are wet and slippery, so the men can hardly walk. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> said that the men's

               <p>We proceeded in the two pirogues, leaving the six canoes to bring on the meat of
                  the buffalo killed last night. The shore conditions of yesterday continue today,
                  and fatigue the men excessively. One fourth of the time they are in the cold water
                  up to their armpits. They cannot wear their moccasins because of the mud, and
                  sometimes have to walk over yards of sharp rocks. At noon, the captains gave the
                  men a dram which they received with cheerfulness, and was well deserved. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> walked ashore in this
                  wild, eroded country, and killed two big-horn sheep, and a fat buffalo.</p>

               <p>We set out early and proceeded as usual by the tow-line. One of the party killed a
                  big-horn sheep which had fine horns. We stopped at 2 p.m. to dine and air our
                  goods. The country is more level now, and coal seams appear in the bluffs.</p>

               <p>We towed the boats and went on much better than for the past two days, as the
                  banks are well calculated for towing. As game is abundant, we begin to make a
                  collection of hides for the purpose of making a leather boat. The hunters brought
                  in six elk, two buffalo, two mule deer and a bear— the last nearly causing
                  the death of <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and
                  Charbonneau. We came to a large river which <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> named "Maria's River," where we
                  camped.</p>

               <p>We moved our camp over to the point between the two rivers. Both are equally large
                  so we had to determine which of these rivers is the true Missouri. To choose the
                  wrong stream might lose us the whole season, and would probably dishearten the
                  party and defeat the expedition altogether. To this end, an investigation of both
                  streams was the first thing to be done. We dispatched two canoes with three men
                  each up these two rivers with instructions to discover the bearing of these rivers
                  by ascending the rising grounds. The parties are to return by evening. The men
                  seem to feel that the north fork [the Maria's] is the real Missouri, but the
                  captains reserve the opinion that the south fork is the correct one. We are
                  astonished that the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name>
                  Indians had not given us more precise information. The party in camp is busy
                  dressing skins for clothing. Many of them can scarcely walk because of mangled and
                  bruised feet. The canoe parties returned in the evening with their reports. Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> had ascended the
                  north fork and had taken distances. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> with <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph
                     Whitehouse</name> had ascended the south fork. The Fields brothers had walked
                  up the north fork some seven miles. Their reports were not convincing of the
                  fundamental points, so the captains concluded to ascend both rivers far enough to
                  observe the main direction the rivers took so that they could satisfy themselves
                  on the one which would be most expedient to take for the journey to the Pacific.
                  They gave orders for Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>,

                  explored the south fork. At camp that evening two grizzly bears nearly caught

                  his gun as it was wet. The rest of the party yelled and fired guns which alarmed

                  hill to take bearings. They returned at noon and reported that the river ran
                  north-westerly. The canoes which the party were using were overloaded with the

               <p>It rained during the night. At daylight all but the boat men descended by land. In
                  passing along the face of a bluff, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> slipped, and but for a fortunate recovery by means of his
                  espontoon, would have been precipitated into the river down a craggy precipice of
                  about ninety feet. He reached a place where he could stand and heard <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>'s voice behind him saying
                  "Good God, Captain, what shall I do?" <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> turned and found that <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name> had lost his foothold and had slipped
                  down to the very edge of the precipice, where he lay on his belly, with his right

                  raised himself on his knees. He crawled in this manner to a safe place. The rest

                  cousin, Miss Maria Wood. His party reached the main camp in the afternoon, much to
                  the relief of us who feared for their safety, for they had been out two days
                  longer than the appointed time, and it was feared they had met with some accident.
                  Meanwhile the men at the base camp were busy hunting, airing the stores and
                  dressing skins. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  plotted the courses of the two rivers as far as they had been explored. The maps

               <p>We determined to deposit at this place the large red pirogue and all the heavy
                  baggage which we could possibly do without — along with some provisions,
                  salt, blacksmith's tools, powder and lead. We do this to lighten our vessels, and
                  at the same time, add to them the crew of the seven hands who heretofore have been
                  employed in navigating the red pirogue. We sent a party of seven men to dig a hole
                  to bury the goods. Peter Cruzatte, being acquainted with the method of making a
                  cache, was left the supervision of constructing it. Cruzatte is an old Missouri
                  navigator, and from his integrity, knowledge and skill as a waterman, has acquired
                  the confidence of every individual of the party. Cruzatte declared it is of his
                  opinion that the north fork is the true Missouri — and could be no other.
                  Finding the men so determined in this belief, and wishing that if the captains
                  were in error to detect it and rectify it as soon as possible, it was agreed among
                  the captains that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  would take a small party by land up the south fork until they found the Great
                  Falls by which means we would know the true Missouri. As <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> is the best waterman, he is to depart
                  with the canoes the day after tomorrow. Some of our arms and the air-gun needed
                  repairs, and as we intend to cache the blacksmith's bellows and tools here, we set
                  about making the repairs. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> made several observations to fix this important location. In the

                  been concealed from the view of civilized man. He determined to send <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> down in the morning to

                  resolved to try on <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>. Six men

                  Two hunters went to get elk skins to cover the iron frame boat. We had trouble
                  with the canoes in the rapids — one turned upside down and nearly drowned

               <p>We drew the white pirogue on shore into a thick bunch of willows, fastened her
                  securely, drove out the plugs in her bottom, and covered her with bushes and
                  driftwood to hide and shelter her from the sun. We now selected a place for a

                  were overhauling, airing and repacking our Indian goods, ammunition, provisions

                  replace, a resource which we have very frequent occasion for. The hunters returned

                  that sticks be set up on the prairie to mark the way of the portage. There are
                  several ravines that have to be avoided. Not having seen any Indians, nor knowing
                  if in fact they could be depended upon for friendship or hostility, we have
                  conceived that our party is already small, and have concluded therefore not to
                  dispatch a canoe with part of our men back to St. Louis, as we had intended to do
                  when we made our plans this spring. The captains had never hinted to any of the
                  party that they had such a scheme in contemplation. The men all appear to have

                  named the Medicine River thus because of the rumbling sounds heard nearby —

                  look for <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> took the canoe to put Lewis on the other
                  side of the Missouri, then <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> went back to meet <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> and bring in the dried meat to the White Bear Island
                  camp. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s came to camp
                  and told us that <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>
                  was still out at their hunting camp guarding the meat they had dried. The iron
                  frame boat is set up and is 36 feet long, 4½ feet wide at the beam, and 26
                  inches deep. The frame had been built at Harper's Ferry in Virginia at <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> is completely recovered. Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> had difficulty in procuring good
                  timber. <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Robert Frazier</name> is sewing
                  the hides together for the boat. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> had the remaining canoes drawn from the river and divided the
                  baggage into three parcels, some of which was carried on the backs of the men, and
                  some on wheels, to the portage road. Hoisting a sail, and with four men in
                  harness, the canoes were moved along to the upper camp. At every halt the poor
                  fellows tumble down and are so much fatigued that many of them drop asleep in an
                  instant. In short, their fatigues are incredible; some are limping from the
                  soreness of their feet, others faint and are unable to stand in this heat and
                  altitude. Yet no one complains, and all go on with dogged cheerfulness.</p>

               <p>The main party returned to the lower camp. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and Shields were sent to the White Bear Island

                  is sent in a canoe to <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>'s camp to bring in meat. Joseph Fields was sent up the
                  Missouri to hunt elk, but soon had an encounter with three grizzlies, during
                  which, he cut his hand and knee, but had a fortunate escape. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and Shields found a little bark and timber, and
                  brought back two elk. Elk skins are best for covering the frame boat, for they are
                  more strong and durable than buffalo skins, and do not shrink so much in drying.
                     <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> arrived at evening with one

                  parched meal, pork, powder, lead, axes, tools, biscuit and portable soup. They had

                  used his penknife to bleed him which succeeded in restoring him to health. While
                  at the lower camp, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had
                  a cache prepared to receive Capt. Lewis' desk, specimens of plants, books, etc.
                  The swivel gun was hidden under some rocks. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> was given a dose of salts. Charbonneau

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> determined to visit
                  the large fountain or giant spring that was discovered by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> on the 18th. He set out with <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> in a violent wind and
                  rain storm which thoroughly drenched them. The other men continue to work on the

               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> at the lower camp,
                  decided to ascend the river to remake the sketches he had lost in the wind at the
                  time of his first discovery. With him went <name type="person" key="York">York</name>, Charbonneau, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>
                  and Baptiste, the baby. The storm approaching, they sought shelter in a ravine
                  with shelving rocks under which they took cover. A sudden cloud-burst quickly
                  filled the ravine with a torrent of water. Shoving <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and the baby before him, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and Charbonneau climbed up the steep
                  bluff just in time to escape from being washed away. This ravine was just above
                  the great cataract of the Missouri where, had they been swept into it, they must
                  have inevitably perished. <name type="person" key="York">York</name> was hunting
                  buffalo at the time, so was not in the ravine, but he was alarmed for their
                  safety. Charbonneau lost his gun, shot-pouch, horn and tomahawk. The baby's cradle
                  and clothes were swept away. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>
                  was afraid that <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> would have a
                  relapse from her recent illness. Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> lost his large compass and an elegant fusee, a tomahawk and an
                  umbrella. The compass is a severe loss, for we have no other large one.</p>
               <p>The canoe party during the excessive heat which had preceded the storm had removed
                  their clothes and were practically naked when the storm overtook them. The large
                  hailstones bruised and knocked them about, and cut the scalps of their heads. They
                  were compelled to camp out on the road over night again. The men at the upper camp
                  were in good order under the willow trees, but were concerned for the men on the
                  road. But it all came out well, and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> used some of the hailstones to make a bowl of punch.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> sent two men to hunt

                  on the portage road to move it along. The search party found the compass! Four men

                  season is getting late, and we have not yet crossed the Rocky Mountains. The skin
                  cover for the boat is finished and was put into the water to toughen before sewing
                  on the boat sections tomorrow. It has taken twenty-eight elk and four buffalo

               <p>Nearly all the party are employed on the boat, which is now almost completed. We
                  have not been able to obtain pitch from our kiln, which causes some embarrassment.
                  Some hunters were sent ahead to kill buffalo so that we can make pemmican. We were
                  told that we would leave the buffalo country shortly after passing the falls. If
                  so, we will miss the white puddings that Charbonneau makes. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> fears the boat will be a blunder and
                  useless, for the lack of pitch to seal the seams which had to be sewn together
                  with a coarse needle. The boat looks good and is very light in proportion to its
                  size. The river looks so gentle above the falls that all the men are anxious to be
                  moving onward. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> having

                  working on the canoes and repairing moccasins. A good pair will not last more than
                  two days in this country. The <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>

               <p>We turned the iron boat over and built small fires under her to dry the skin, and
                  applied pitch and tallow to the seams. We hear those noises towards the north-west
                  when the weather is calm. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.

                  perilous part of our journey, yet no one repines, and all appear ready to meet any
                  difficulties which might await us. Our work being completed, we had a drink of
                  spirits — the last of our stock — save a little reserved for sickness.
                  The fiddle was played by Cruzatte, and the men danced until 9 p.m. Festive jokes
                  and songs prevailed, and the men were merry until late at night. Thus we
                  celebrated the 4th of July in a civil and jovial manner.</p>

               <p>We exposed the keel to the sun and pounded charcoal, beeswax and tallow into the

                  Three other men visited the falls today — the last of the party who have not

                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> caught some small
                  fish this evening. Four hunters were sent down the river to get buffalo —
                  they did not return this evening. Some of the men are dressing skins to make
                  clothes.</p>

               <p>We have no tents now for they were put into the cache, so we are obliged to use
                  the boat-sails to keep off the wet weather. The men's leather clothing soon rots
                  by being constantly exposed to water, and they are busy preparing new skins. The
                  iron boat is finished except for greasing and drying. The buffalo are leaving this
                  place to go to the plains below. Joseph <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> is busy making clothes for the men.
                     <name type="person" key="York">York</name> is sick and was given a dose of
                  tartar emetic. He is better this evening. One of our party is making sacks of wolf

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> set out to replace the
                  maps and measurements previously made of the river and falls, and a large party
                  went along to kill buffalo. The day being fair and warm, about noon we applied the
                  charcoal- tallow-beeswax composition to the boat. It gives her the appearance of
                  being one solid piece of covering — particularly after the second coat. We
                  call her the "Experiment." <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph

               <p>The boat was put in the water and she swam perfectly well. The seats were fixed
                  and the oars fitted. We loaded the boats, but a storm came up, and the boats had
                  to be unloaded. The composition separated from the skins and left the seams
                  exposed, so the iron boat leaked very much. As we cannot repair her without pitch,
                  and that article is not to be procured here, we are forced, reluctantly, to
                  abandon her. We therefore need two more canoes to transport our baggage. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and the ten best workmen
                  went upstream to where there are trees large enough to construct canoes. The iron
                  boat was taken apart and the party prepared to transport our goods in the present
                  six canoes. The men sharpened their axes this evening on a small grindstone we had
                  brought from Harper's Ferry, so that we could make an early start in the morning.
                  We made a cache in which we will leave a few papers at this place.</p>

It is more than twice
                  the distance by water as it is by land. The men are to return for the balance of

                  three miles of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s camp, but a
                  violent storm prevented them from getting any closer. The canoe builders under

                  others, having on board valuable articles which might be injured by water, went
                  more cautiously, and did not reach his camp until evening. The men with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> were occupied in
                  hunting, but without much success. The men are much afflicted with painful felons.
                  William <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> is unable to

                  was sent with three men to bring in the buffalo meat that had been killed by the

                  Lewis' camp with three canoes and three men for the remainder of the baggage, but
                  a wind came up which forced them to camp for the night enroute. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> killed a

                  carrying meat, but it was replaced immediately. It is painful, but is not apt to

                  them. The mosquitoes and black gnats are very troublesome. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name>'s party with the canoes arrived at

               <p>The rest of the baggage was embarked in the six small canoes and each was manned
                  by two men. We now bid adieu to the White Bear camp. <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name> is sick, so Charbonneau was sent in

                  winds. They had to unload and drain the canoes which prevented them from reaching
                  camp. We eat very much meat; it requires four deer, an elk and a deer, or one
                  buffalo to supply us for twenty-four hours. We reserve our flour and parched meal
                  for later when game might not be so plentiful. The hunters killed three buffalo
                  which were made into pemmican — dried and pounded meat, mixed with fat. The
                  canoes are finished except for putting in some knees. We have to use our nets to
                  protect us from the mosquitoes.</p>

                  wide and only need seats and oars to be complete. The older canoes were unloaded

               <p>We arose very early and loaded the canoes. We now have eight canoes and all are
                  heavily laden despite the goods we have cached. We do have a considerable amount
                  of dried meat and tallow, but the men add bulky articles of little value or use to
                  them. At 10 a.m. we were under way. Capt. Lewis, <name type="person" key="Potts, John">John Potts</name> and <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name> walked ashore all day. We went into

                  manned the canoes and used the tow-line. The navigation is now very laborsome as

               <p>We set out early and passed the entrance of a considerable river which we name the
                  "Dearborn" after our Secretary of War. As we are anxious to meet the <name type="native_nation" key="Paiute Indians">Snake</name> Indians, we thought it
                  wise for one of the captains to take a small party by land some distance to
                  discover them, as they might be alarmed by the discharge of our guns as we hunt.

               <p>By using the tow-rope, we were able to overcome the swift current. The country

                  bushel of wild onions. While we were taking breakfast the men also gathered these
                  onions. Capt. Lewis shot an otter but it sank to the bottom. The water is so clear
                  that he dove in and retrieved it. As the canoes had taken different routes through
                  the islands, it was some time before we all gathered at dinner time. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> went back a mile for a
                  thermometer which <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>

                  country as the land she had lived in as a girl, and that this is the river on
                  which her relatives live. This information cheers the party. Though <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s feet are blemished and

                  a creek which we named "<name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> Creek" [now either Confederate or Duck Creek]. We halted
                  early to dry some articles which had become wet. Gigs were fastened to the ends of
                  the setting poles which helped our progress. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> followed an old Indian trail and is
                  much in advance of us. He arrived at the Three Forks of the Missouri. Leaving a
                  note for the canoe party below, he went up the north fork [<name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>] as it seemed to bear more to the
                  west. He ascended it about thirty-five miles and encamped, much fatigued and his
                  feet blistered and wounded by the cactus thorns. Charbonneau gave out — his
                  ankles failed him — so was unable to proceed farther.</p>

               <p>The boat party set out early. The water is still strong and has some riffles. We
                  killed a pair of young geese, but they are small game to subsist a party as large
                  as ours. The men are forbidden to waste ammunition on them for it delays our

               <p>We passed the entrance of a creek which we named "Howard's Creek" [now Green or
                  16-Mile Creek]. We found the note left by Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. He had left Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> at the camp while he,
                     <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s and <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Robert Frazier</name> went on to the top of
                  a mountain where they had an extensive view of the valley. They saw no Indians.
                  They descended by way of an Indian trail and rejoined Charbonneau and Joseph
                  Fields. In passing an island on the <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name> River, Charbonneau was nearly swept away by the current
                  — and he cannot swim. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.

               <p>The river is rapid, and the men begin to weaken from the exertion of rowing. We
                  arrived at the Three Forks of the Missouri and camped for breakfast. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> climbed a hill and
                  made a map of the meanderings of the streams. The canoe party went up the middle
                  [Madison] fork for a mile and camped to give the men a much needed rest. We
                  unloaded the canoes and securely covered the baggage on shore. It is important
                  that we select the correct fork to ascend. Each fork seems to carry the same
                  amount of water, so to call any one of them the "Missouri" would be giving a
                  preference not warranted. The hunters returned at evening with six deer, three
                  otter and a muskrat.</p>
               <p>At 3 p.m. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> arrived very
                  sick with a high fever. He took five of Dr. Rush's pills. We intend to stay here
                  for several days, so the men put their deer skins in the water to prepare them for
                  dressing tomorrow. We are concerned that we do not find the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> Indians, for the
                  success of our expedition is doubtful if we do not find some Indians with horses.
                  We take consolation in the thought that if the Indians can live here and acquire
                  food to subsist — so can we. It was near here that <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> was captured by the Minnitaree about five

                  this morning since the pills have operated. We sent two men up to the southeast

                  and the canoes overtook them. After dinner, the two invalids and Charbonneau and

                  wondering if the canoes were below or above him. Soon Charbonneau appeared and
                  informed Lewis that the canoes were below. The boats had been detained by the
                  twistings and rapidity of the river. After they all had breakfast, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> resumed his walk. At

                  are so reduced, we found that we could proceed with one less canoe. We therefore
                  drew one of them into a high thicket and secured her in the event the river should
                  rise. The air gun was out of order but was repaired by Shields, and now is
                  regulated and shoots as well as ever. The baggage now being dry, the party under
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> proceded up the
                  Beaverhead Fork. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  and Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> remained at the forks
                  to obtain some observations then rejoined the canoe party at the evening camp.
                     <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> brought in a

               <p>As one canoe had been left behind, we have more men for hunting. We therefore
                  dispatched four men to hunt. The seven canoes were set off at sunrise. At noon
                     <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s arrived, but had
                  no news of <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>. The boil on

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and his party
                  followed an Indian road towards the mountains which took them into a valley where
                  the river divided itself again. Here the Indian road also forked. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> was sent to explore
                  one, while Shields took the other to determine the most traveled one. Meanwhile,
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> wrote a note to
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, recommending that
                  he wait at the forks. He put this note on a dry willow pole. His party decided to
                  take the western road, as it was the most used and led in the direction they
                  wished to travel [Prairie Creek].</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> set off at sunrise
                  with the canoes, but the river was very crooked and shallow, so we were obliged to

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' party set out
                  early on the Indian road, but the track soon disappeared. He therefore set out
                  towards a narrow pass on the creek with the hopes of recovering the trail. He sent
                     <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> to the right and
                  Shields to the left with orders to search for the road, and if successful, to
                  signal by placing their hat on the muzzle of their gun. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name> kept on, and after going about five miles
                  discovered an Indian on horseback coming towards them. They were overjoyed at the
                  sight of this stranger. When we had come within a mile, the Indian halted, and
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> did also. He
                  unloosened the blanket from his pack and threw it up in the air by holding two
                  corners, he then spread it on the ground as a signal of friendship. This signal
                  did not seem to have the desired effect on the Indian, for he watched <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and Shields on either
                  flank of Capt. Lewis with suspicion. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> took some presents and walked towards the Indian, calling
                  "tab-ba-bone," which in <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> means "white man." <ref target="nch1401" n="1"/>
                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> saw the
                  predicament, but Shields kept coming on, so when Capt. Lewis was about one hundred
                  paces away, the Indian put the whip to his horse and vanished. We now set out on
                  the track of the horse, hoping by that means it would lead to an Indian camp. We
                  decided that if we followed too closely, the Indians might move off, so we made a
                  camp on an elevated position where we took breakfast. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> prepared a small assortment of
                  trinkets consisting of moccasin awls, beads, paint and a looking glass which was
                  attached to a pole and planted near the fire with the thought that should the
                  Indians return to our camp, they might discover by this token that we were
                  friendly. A rain came up which made the track hard to follow, but we went some
                  five miles where we saw signs of many horses. We camped on a small creek and
                  planted a flag.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> with the canoes found
                  the stream shallow and rapid, which caused the men to be in the water much of the

                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> was sent as soon as
                  it was light to try to discover the route the Indian had taken. He followed it to
                  the mountain where it ascended, then he returned to camp. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> determined to follow the base of the
                  mountain with the expectation of finding an Indian road which would lead over the
                  mountains. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> was sent
                  to the right, and Shields to the left to look for fresh tracks. After going four
                  miles we found some recent bowers where the Indians had been gathering roots. We
                  fell in with a large Indian road which we followed in and out of the ravines and
                  streams. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> shot at a
                  large animal which might have been a wolverine, but it got away. Four miles
                  further brought us to the distant fountain of the mighty Missouri — in
                  search of which we have spent so many toilsome days and restless nights. Two miles
                  below, <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">Hugh McNeal</name> had stood astride
                  the little riverlet and had thanked his God that he had lived to have a foot on
                  each side of the heretofore deemed endless Missouri. We proceeded on up the
                  dividing ridge from which we saw immense ranges of high mountains lying to the
                  west. We descended the mountain [by Lemhi Pass] to a creek of cold, clear water
                  [the Lemhi], whose waters find their way to the Columbia. Here we camped for the
                  night.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> had to urge his

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and his little
                  party followed the Indian road in a westerly direction. At about four miles we saw
                  two women, a man and some dogs on an eminence immediately before us. They viewed
                  us with attention, and two of them sat down to await our arrival. The rest of our
                  party halted while <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  walked slowly towards them, making signs of friendship, but the Indians
                  disappeared. We followed the back track which led us along the road we had been
                  traveling. We had not gone but a mile when we came upon three females. One ran
                  off, but the two others saw we were too near them for escape, and they hung their
                  heads as if reconciled to die. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> raised the elderly woman, repeated the word tab-ba- bone, and
                  unbared his arm to show her his skin. The women were instantly reconciled, and he
                  gave them some beads, moccasin awls, paint and pewter looking-glasses. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> was directed to tell
                  the woman to call the younger woman lest she alarm the camp. The old woman did so,
                  and the fugitive girl returned. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> also gave her some presents, and painted their tawny faces with
                  vermillion which is emblematic of peace. We informed them by signs that we wished
                  to meet their chiefs. They ran off and we set out on the road along the river. We
                  went two miles and were met by about sixty warriors mounted on excellent horses,
                  who came on at nearly full speed. When they arrived, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> advanced, leaving his gun with our
                  party about fifty paces behind. The women showed the advanced group the presents
                  we had given them. The warriors then advanced and embraced <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> very affectionately. Both parties
                  then came forward, and we were besmeared with their grease. We smoked the pipe,
                  and the principal chief, Ca-me-ah-wait, addressed the warriors. We then moved on
                  to their encampment on the river, four miles from where we had first met them. We
                  explained the objects of our journey, and all the men and women looked at us
                  — the first white people they had ever seen. It was now late, and as we had
                  not tasted food since the evening before, they gave us some cakes made of service
                  and choke berries. <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> informed
                  us that this stream, the Lemhi, discharged itself into another [the Salmon] but
                  the latter was confined between inaccessible mountains and canyons and was
                  impossible of travel. They have a great number of horses and we are hopeful of
                  obtaining enough to transport our stores. The Indians danced nearly all night.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his
                  party set out, having dispatched some hunters ahead. The stream became more rapid
                  and shallow. They passed a creek which they named after <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">Hugh McNeal</name> [Blacktailed Deer Creek, near Dillon,
                  Montana]. They killed only one deer, but caught a number of fine trout.</p>

                  of his main party on the other side of the divide and asked if his warriors would

                  made one half into a berry pudding — the other half to save until evening.
                  We gave some to the chief. The Indians do not seem anxious to move, and it
                  developed that some of them thought we were in league with their enemies the

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> appealed to the

                  seemed as if the whole village, including some women, were with us. About sunset

                  an antelope as we neared the place where we expected to meet Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s party. We made a halt. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> put his cocked-hat on
                     <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> who in turn placed
                  Indian trinkets on <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>.
                  With Lewis' tanned skin, long hair and leather clothes, he looked like a complete
                  Indian. We rode on two more miles, and were mortified that the canoe party was not
                  there. The Indians were suspicious, and feared an ambush, which required every act
                  of diplomacy on our part to allay their fears and keep them with us. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> is to be sent with a
                  note to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> in the
                  morning, for we are confident that there was not a moment to spare. Capt. Lewis
                  slept fitfully, concerned over the delay of the canoe party and the fickleness of
                  the Indians. We had explained to them that we had a woman of their nation with the
                  party, and also a black man. The Indians were curious and seemed as anxious to see
                  this monster as they were for our merchandise.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his party
                  struggled against the rapids and narrow bottoms. <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> gathered service berries while others caught
                  some trout enroute. One deer was killed. Moving the canoes was hard and slow, and
                  the men were fatigued and exhausted.</p>

               <p>This morning <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and an
                  Indian were sent down to the river while <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> was sent to hunt. <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name> cooked the remainder of the deer on which we breakfasted with
                  the chief. An Indian came to camp and reported that white men were coming. The
                  Indians were as overjoyed as <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> was. Shortly afterwards, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> arrived. She proved to be the sister of <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name>, and their meeting was really affecting
                  — particularly with another woman, "otter woman," who had been taken captive
                  at the same time she had been, but who had escaped and rejoined her people. At
                  noon the canoes arrived and we had the satisfaction of being all together again ;
                  and the prospect of being able to obtain horses so that we could prosecute our
                  journey by land. We unloaded the canoes and arranged the baggage on shore. At
                  evening we called the Indians together and through the medium of <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>, Charbonneau and
                     <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, we communicated the
                  object that had brought us into their country. We made them sensible of their
                  dependence on our government for merchandise, defence and peace. We told them we
                  wanted to go as far as the western ocean as a means to find a more direct route to
                  bring merchandise to them. We told them we needed horses to accomplish this, but
                  would pay them in return. They appeared well pleased. We gave medals to the chiefs
                  and also clothes and presents, and some hominy, which was the first they had ever
                  eaten. <name type="person" key="York">York</name> and the sagacity of <name type="person" key="Seaman">Scannon</name> were objects of their admiration. The
                  hunters killed four deer and an antelope which we shared with the Indians.</p>
               <p>Our captains now concerted measures for our future operations. It was agreed that
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> would take Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, Cruzatte, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and probably <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>, Shields and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph
                     Fields</name>, with the necessary tools for making canoes on the other side of
                  the divide. Also, Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and the Indians are to go with him to hasten the return of
                  the Indians there with horses for <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>. Meanwhile, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was to bring the rest of the party and baggage to <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> Cove. The spirits
                  of the men are now much elated. We concluded to leave our canoes at this place,
                  for we may need them when we return home later.</p>

               <p>We bartered for four horses to outfit <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his men, and the whole Indian party except two men and
                  two women, set out with him for the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> camp. We have reached the extreme
                  navigable point of the Missouri. We had the stores and baggage aired, and began
                  making packages of proper size for transportation by horse back. We put raw hide
                  in the water for later making of thongs and gear for packing, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a deer, and one man caught a
                  beaver. Today <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> is
                  thirty-one years old, and he resolved hereafter to live for mankind instead of for

               <p>At daylight three hunters went out. Some of the men are in want of moccasins and
                  leggings, so are dressing skins. Others are making packsaddles, repacking baggage,
                  etc. We made a seine of willow branches and caught a number of fine trout. The
                  hunters returned with two deer. These Indians have a custom of bartering their
                  infant daughters for future marriage. <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> had thus been disposed of before her capture, and her
                  proposed husband is living here with this band. He was more than double her age,
                  and has two other wives. He claimed her, but as she had had a child by
                  Charbonneau, now he did not want her. Our men are instructed to give these Indians
                  no cause for jealousy by having connections with their women without the knowledge
                  of their husbands. <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> is a man
                  of influence, good sense and of reserved manners, and appears to possess much
                  sincerity. He wears his hair cut close all over his head, in mourning for his
                  deceased relatives. These <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> are now on the eve of their departure for the Missouri to hunt
                  buffalo.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Captain Clark</name> continued his route
                  and was met by an Indian with two mules. This Indian had the politeness to offer
                  one for <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> to ride, for
                  which a waistcoat was given him for his civility. They value their mules three or
                  four times to that of horses.</p>

               <p>The men are hunting and packing. We selected a spot, unseen by the Indians, to
                  make a cache for the articles we intend to leave here, such as specimens of
                  plants, minerals, seeds, etc. Having no nails or boards, we substituted thongs of
                  raw hide to make packsaddles. We did use some of the planks from the packing
                  cases, and some of the oars, for frames. We put the goods in the leather bags we
                  had made. In this way we made twenty packsaddles. The Indian women have been
                  making and repairing moccasins for the men. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> recovered a trap that he had set
                  last night, two miles below the place he had set it. <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Silas Goodrich</name> caught several dozens of fine
                  trout.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his party reached
                  the new camp of the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> over the divide, and they halted for rest. He was given a
                  salmon and some cakes of dried berries. He requested a guide to accompany him down
                  the river. An elderly man was pointed out who consented to undertake the task. The
                  chief drew a map of the country on the ground. He placed a number of heaps of sand
                  on each side of his sketch of the [Salmon] river to represent vast mountains of
                  rock through which that river passed. He described the river as being confined in
                  a narrow channel through steep cliffs –filled with sharp, pointed rocks and
                  foam. He said that none of his nation had ever been down this river beyond these
                  mountains. The old man confirmed the statements just made, but informed us that
                  his nation, the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez
                     Perces</name>, resided at a twenty-one-days march from here, and that they
                  traded with white people for articles from the sea, cloth, metal, etc. He told us
                  that to get to his relations we would be obliged to climb over steep and rocky
                  mountains for seven days where game was scarce. He also described other routes
                  which appear to be across deserts towards the Gulf of California. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> determined to explore
                  this river to see if the accounts were true, and if so, to take the other mountain
                  route, for he reasoned that if women and children could pass it, then our party
                  could. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> went on,
                  leaving Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> to
                  return to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' camp
                  with the Indians and horses. He left Cruzatte to purchase a horse and then
                  overtake him. An old Indian continued with him.</p>

                  arrived. By evening, all the packages, saddles and bags were ready for the march.
                  We deposited some articles in the cache. The hunters returned unsuccessful, so the
                  party was issued pork and corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> resumed his
                  exploration and met some Indians who gave him boiled and dried salmon. They take
                  them in weirs and with gigs. He sent <name type="person" key="Collins, John">John
                     Collins</name> and an Indian in search of Cruzatte who had not yet joined us.
                  An Indian presented us with <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>'s tomahawk which had been lost or stolen at the Indian camp.
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> was joined this
                  evening by <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and Cruzatte who
                  brought five fresh salmon given them by Indians. He is much pleased with the
                  intelligent, friendly old guide. In justice to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, who was the first white man to see
                  this [Salmon] river at the time when he was looking for Indians, we named it,
                  "Lewis' River."</p>

               <p>A couple of men finished covering the cache which we could not do last night in
                  the dark. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> returned
                  with a fawn and some Indian plunder. While hunting, he had come across some
                  Indians. While talking with them, they took his gun and fled on their horses.
                  After trying to recover his gun, he decided to bring their baggage to camp. It
                  mostly consists of roots, of which <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> had samples prepared to make notes of. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> is employed making leather shirts
                  and overalls.</p>
               <p>At 11 a.m., Charbonneau, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>,
                     <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> and about fifty men,
                  women and children arrived at Lewis' camp. The Indians camped near us. Having no
                  meat, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> prepared
                  beans and corn for them to eat. We gave <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> some dried squashes which we had boiled. He said it was the
                  best thing he had ever tasted — except sugar — a small lump of which
                  his sister, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, had given him.
                  In the evening the men built a brush drag, and in two hours they caught 528 very
                  good fish — mostly trout. We gave most of the fish to the Indians. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> purchased five good
                  horses. The Indians are very orderly and do not disturb our articles they see
                  lying about. They borrow knives, kettles, etc., from our men, but always return
                  them.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> with his guide,
                  examined the north fork of the Salmon, encountering many Indians who were taking
                  salmon from the streams. The country is very rocky and steep, and the river is
                  rapid with stones scattered throughout. The Indian account was not
                  exaggerated.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">UGUST</hi> 23.</head>
               <p>The Indians appear to depend on us for food, so we sent two hunters out on
                  horseback to hunt at a greater distance. Our stock of corn and flour is too low to
                  indulge them with more. We laid up the canoes in a pond, and after taking out the
                  plugs, we weighted them down with stones. We hope by this means to guard them
                  against the effects of high water and the fires which are kindled in the plains by
                  the natives. The Indians went on a hunt and got two mule deer and two common deer.
                  At 3 p.m. the expected party of Indians arrived, but we learned that most of them
                  were on their way to the buffalo country. This causes us some anxiety, for they
                  had promised to assist us over the mountains. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> traded for one horse, but the
                  natives are not inclined to part with any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s party proceeded with
                  difficulty in the exceedingly rough country. He followed an Indian track at times
                  and ascended a mountain from which he had a view of the mountains to the west. He
                  was now satisfied of the impracticability of this route, either by land or water,
                  and so informed the old Indian guide. This guide, whom we call "Tobey," drew maps
                  in the sand and by his evident familiarity with the country, Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was convinced that the trail to
                  the north which the guide had indicated, is more practical. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> is unwell. We decided to
                  rejoin Capt. Lewis and party.</p>
            </div>

               <p>Lewis traded for three horses and a mule in exchange for a battle axe, a knife, a
                  handkerchief and a little paint. The Indians told us they have no more horses to
                  trade. We now have nine horses and a mule, and with two hired, make twelve. We had
                  given Charbonneau some articles so that he could trade for a horse for <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> to ride. The Indian squaws
                  loaned us their horses, so we have twenty in all. We loaded the horses and set out
                  at noon. An Indian offered <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> a horse to ride. Peter <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name> is very ill with colic. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> gave him peppermint and laudanum,
                  which relieved him. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> had
                  remained with him while he was sick. <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name> was mounted on Lewis' horse, and the captain walked. <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Silas Goodrich</name>, our fisherman,
                  caught several fine trout. We camped near the Cove, making only five miles because
                  of <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name>'s illness.</p>

                  horses and set out at sunrise. We went about seven miles and halted. The hunters
                  brought in three deer which was divided among the Indians. Charbonneau mentioned
                  that <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> had told him that they
                  expected to meet all the Indians tomorrow on their way to the Missouri. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was alarmed by this
                  information, for he learned that <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> had requested his men to meet him to go to the hunting
                  grounds, consequently leaving us and our baggage on the mountains. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> therefore called the
                  three chiefs together, smoked the pipe, and asked them if they were men of their
                  word. <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> confessed that he had
                  done wrong, but his people were hungry, and this fact had influenced him. He
                  promised to keep his word and assist us. We moved on to the Cove where the creek
                  enters the mountains. <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name>
                  fired his musket at some ducks, and the bullet rebounded from the water and passed

                  the horses and set out at sunrise. We soon arrived at the extreme source of the
                  Missouri, and the men drank of the water and consoled themselves at having at
                  length arrived at this long wished for point. We crossed the divide at Lemhi Pass
                  and drank the water of a stream flowing to the Pacific. We halted at a spring to
                  dine and graze our horses, there being fine grass where the spring moistens the
                  soil — all else being dry and parched by the sun. We gave a pint of corn to
                  each Indian who has been helping us transport our baggage, and the same to our
                  men. One of the Indian women paused to give birth to a child, but within the hour
                  she arrived in camp with her newborn babe, apparently as well as ever. We came to
                  the Indian encampment where we found <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John
                     Colter</name> who had just arrived with a letter from <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>. Upon reading the letter, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> advised <name type="person" key="Cameahwait">Cameahwait</name> that we wished to purchase
                  twenty more horses. We asked for a guide, but were informed that the old man with
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> was better informed
                  of the country than any other man. Matters being arranged, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> ordered the fiddles to be played and
                  our men danced for the amusement of the Indians so that we could obtain more
                  horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> sent three men ahead
                  to hunt. As his horses were missing, the old guide and four men went to look for
                  them. This delayed us until 9 a.m., when we then proceeded up to the forks. We had
                  nothing to eat but a few salmon.</p>

               <p>Having made our purchases, we loaded our horses and prepared to start. We have
                  thirty horses. We took leave of the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name>, who set out for the Missouri, and we at
                  the same time, with Tobey and his four sons–and another Indian, began the

                  perfectly happy to remain with the white people [She probably never saw her people

                  provisions. We camped at the place where we found Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and his companion, for there is good grass

               <p>We resumed our journey, and in three hours halted to let our horses graze near

                  party is too busy with the horses to do any hunting. We made a hungry camp this

               <p>We sent two men back two miles for the load of the horse which was crippled
                  yesterday. We are crossing the mountains [Bitterroot Range] which are high and
                  steep. The last of our thermometers was broken by accident. We also ate the last

                  which appeared to run in the direction we wished to go. Our hunters killed a deer
                  which we made good use of. We went down the creek five miles to its forks [Ross'
                  Hole] where we met a party of about thirty-three lodges or some four hundred
                  people and at least five hundred horses of the Flathead nation. They received us
                  with much friendship. We camped with them, smoked the pipe and made speeches. We

                  language is very strange, so we proceeded to the more intelligible language of
                  giving presents. We purchased twelve horses, and swapped seven of our lame ones.

                  of the Missouri. We came down and made camp in a small bottom. We secured our
                  horses well for fear of them leaving us, or being stolen. We named the stream we
                  are on "<name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s River" [the

                  a considerable waterfall somewhere below. Old Tobey could not inform us where this
                  river discharges itself into the Columbia. He knew of the [Hellgate] branch that
                  leads towards the Missouri. We continued down the west side of the river and
                  camped on a large creek that falls in from the west. We determined to rest here
                  and make observations, so we call this creek "Traveler's Rest Creek" [Lolo Creek].
                  From here we will take the trail that our old guide knows through the

                  they were <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>. One
                  was persuaded to remain with us to guide us to his people who reside on the

                  he became restless and set out alone. We went seven miles and camped at some old

                  took a wrong one, which took us out of the way some three miles. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> came up without the

               <p>During the day we ascended a high mountain. Some places were so steep that the
                  horses fell down backwards and rolled down the rocks some twenty or thirty feet,
                  but none was killed. The horse which carried <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' desk and small trunk turned over,
                  and rolled down forty yards before he lodged against a tree. This broke the desk,
                  but the horse was but little hurt. When we arrived at the top of the mountain, we
                  could find no water, so we used snow to cook the remainder of the colt, and made
                  some soup. Our horses begin to fail, and two are so worn out and poor that we are
                  obliged to leave them behind.</p>

               <p>When we awoke we were covered with snow. We mended our moccasins and some of the

                  another colt and ate half of it.</p>

               <p>Our horses were so scattered in the timber that we were detained until 10 a.m.

                  with him. The men are growing weak and arc losing flesh; several are afflicted

                  merchandise and all of Capt. Lewis' winter clothing. Therefore two of the best

                  Indian came, with great caution, to meet us. He conducted us to a large lodge. We
                  learned by signs that this was the lodge of his great chief who then was absent on
                  a war hunt. The women gave us buffalo meat, berries, dried salmon and roots. After
                  such a long abstinence, this was a sumptuous feast. We gave them some presents and
                  moved on two miles with a chief to his village. We were treated kindly, so we
                  camped with them. The hunters discovered some signs of game, but could kill

                  soon met <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s whom <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had sent. He brought
                  dried salmon and roots, so we halted for refreshment for there was enough food to
                  satisfy our hunger. He had also killed a crow. At 5 p.m. we arrived at the first
                  Indian lodges. The men searching for the lost horses came in. They had found the

               <p>Meanwhile, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> met the

                  encamped [Weippe Prairie]. We cautioned them of the consequences of overeating so

               <p>We traded with the Indians for roots, camas bread and dressed elk skins. We make
                  shirts of the skins. The Indians were assembled and we told them where we had come

                  much. We gathered our horses and proceeded to the second village two miles
                  distant. Capt. Lewis and two men are very sick this evening and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s hip is painful. The

                  river, where the hunters joined us with four deer and two salmon. We hunted for
                  trees large enough to build canoes, and then camped along the river [near present,

                  We collected thirty-eight of them and they were branded with an iron we had

                  where we could fix the canoe. Tobey and his son, who came over the mountains with

               <p>We set out at 9 a.m. and passed a large creek [Potlatch] to which we gave the name
                  of "<name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>'s," after <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name>. After leaving this creek,
                  and as we were passing the last of the fifteen rapids, one of the canoes which
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> was steering, struck a
                  rock and sank. Fortunately, the water was only waist deep, so our baggage was
                  saved, though it was thoroughly wet. We were obliged to halt for the night and
                  spread the baggage to dry. We found the two <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name> chiefs, <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> and Tetoharsky, here who had promised to
                  go with us to help as pilots. After we had had a smoke, they willingly came
                  aboard. We bought some salmon and two dogs from the Indians. John <name type="person" key="Thompson, John B.">Thompson</name> was hurt when the canoe
                  upset.</p>

            <div type="entry">
               <head>O<hi rend="center">CTOBER</hi> 9.</head>
               <p>We found that the canoe could be repaired by the time the goods were dry, so we
                  set Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> and George Gibson to work on her. We
                  set out to collect resin from the pine trees. By 1 p.m. the canoe was stronger
                  than ever. One man was sent to trade for fish, rootbread and dogs. At dark, we
                  found that our old guide, Tobey, and his son had left us, and were seen running
                  back up the river several miles. We could not account for their leaving, unless it
                  was that they were afraid of being cast away in the rapids. Tobey had received no
                  pay, nor hinted of his intentions. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> is recovering rapidly. The Indians here are troublesome,
                  and we have to put two sentinels around our baggage to prevent stealing. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>, Cruzatte and <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name> prefer dog flesh to
                  fish, and have traded for some from the Indians.</p>

               <p>We loaded our canoes and set off at 7 a.m. We passed several rapids and halted
                  near the confluence of the [Snake and Clearwater] rivers. The Indians flock around
                  us and we bought a few dogs from them to eat. They ridicule us for this and call
                  us "dog-eaters." Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> was
                  unable to steer the canoe today as he has a fit of the ague. At 11 a.m. we came to
                  a very bad rapid which was full of rocks. We had to take the boats down one at a
                  time. One of them struck a rock and received a hole. We got her safe to shore, and
                  then unloaded and repaired her. The Indians caught some of our oars which had been
                  washed ashore. At 5 p.m. we came to the [Snake] river. A misunderstanding arose
                  between the two Fields brothers and Charbonneau. We believe it was started over a
                  jest.</p>

               <p>We set out early. At six miles we came to some Indian lodges and took breakfast.
                  We purchased all the salmon we could, and seven dogs. Later, at another Indian
                  camp, we purchased some roots and five more dogs. Most of our men have been
                  accustomed to meat and do not relish fish. They prefer dog meat, which, when well
                  cooked, tastes very well. We passed nine rapids — all of them great fishing
                  places. Two Indians accompany us in a small canoe.</p>

               <p>After purchasing all the provisions these Indians could spare, we set out. We
                  passed several rapids — some of them very bad. We came to one to view it
                  before we attempted its descent. We found it was about two miles in length, with
                  many turns necessary to avoid the rocks. Two of the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name> remained on board with us and acted as
                  pilots. We determined to camp above. We find wood is very scarce which we need to
                  cook our victuals.</p>

               <p>We took two of the canoes down the rapids at a time. The Indians went on before to
                  pilot us. The men who could not swim were sent by land and carried the rifles,
                  instruments, etc. We got safe below by noontime. We came to a large stream which
                  we named "<name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drewyer</name>'s" [now
                  Palouse] after <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George

               <head>O<hi rend="smallcaps">CTOBER</hi> 14.</head>
               <p>We embarked early. About 1 p.m. a canoe steered by Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, hit a rock, and partly sank. A number of
                  things floated out. With the assistance of the other canoes, all the men got safe
                  to shore, but the baggage was wet, and some articles were lost, including bedding,
                  shot pouches, loose powder, roots, etc. Fortunately the lead cannisters of powder
                  were tied down, or we would have lost them when the canoe turned over. We halted
                  on an island to dry the baggage. A small canoe, and three of the Indians in
                  another one, were out of sight at the time of our misfortune, and did not join us.
                  We have made it a point at all times not to take anything belonging to the Indians
                  — even their wood. But in this emergency we are obliged to take some of
                  their split wood for our fires, for no other can be found in any direction. One of
                  the men killed eight ducks.</p>

               <p>We set out late as the captains were making observations and drawing sketches of
                  the route we have passed. We sent out some hunters, but they could not get game of
                  any kind. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> killed
                  two geese and two ducks of large size. Our Indians who had piloted us, crossed
                  over to the place where they thought it proper to delay us above a dangerous
                  rapid. We camped at a place [Rattlesnake Flats] just above Fish-hook Rapids.</p>

               <p>We set out early and all the canoes, except Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>'s, ran the rapids. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>'s ran on a rock, but by the assistance
                  of the three other canoes, it was unloaded and pulled off the rock. There was no
                  injury, other than wetting the greater part of the loading. <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Whitehouse</name> was in the canoe with <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>. We reloaded and
                  proceeded on. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked
                  around the rapids. We halted on a point at the junction of the Snake and Columbia
                  rivers. There were Indians here and we smoked with them. About two hundred came
                  from their camp, singing and dancing as they came. We smoked with them also. We
                  bought from them seven dogs, and they gave us several fresh salmon and some dried
                  horse meat.</p>

               <p>This morning the captains made lunar observations. The chief of the tribe came
                  down and we purchased some dogs from his people. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and two men went up the Columbia River
                  to the first fork to inspect that place. Hunters were sent out to shoot some
                  prairie-cock — a large fowl found near the river. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> took a vocabulary of these Indians,
                  and also of those Indians who live upstream on the [Yakima] river. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his men returned at
                  dark. The party is employed in dressing skins, mending clothes and putting their
                  arms in order — the latter always being a matter of attention with us. Many
                  of the natives have sore eyes, perhaps caused by the reflections from the water
                  where they are continually fishing in an open country, hence the eyes have no
                  rest. They are friendly and not beggarly — but they stole an axe from us
                  last night.</p>

               <p>Several heath hens lit near us and the men killed six of them. The captains are
                  busy taking measurements of the rivers and making meridian altitudes. We purchased
                  forty dogs today. The fish offered by the natives are spoiled and very bad. There
                  are thousands of them washed up on the shores. We set off down the Columbia
                  accompanied by the two chiefs. Our Flathead Indians left us as they are unwilling
                  to go any further. The Great Chief drew us a map of the Columbia River above us
                  and of the tribes that live on its waters.</p>

               <p>Several of the chiefs visited us today. We gave them medals and strings of wampum.
                  Peter Cruzatte played the fiddle which pleased and astonished them. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked ashore with the
                  two chiefs, and Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>. Upon ascending a cliff, he discovered to the west a high
                  mountain covered with snow. We think it is Mt. St. Helens as laid down on
                  Vancouver's map [It was Mt. Adams]. We saw many lodges, but the natives fled and
                  hid. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> searched one
                  lodge, and upon entering, found thirty-three people, some of whom were crying and
                  wringing their hands. He gave them his hand and distributed a few small presents,
                  which pacified them. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields brothers also used every means to convince
                  these people of our friendly intentions. It seems they were frightened because
                  they had seen <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> kill a
                  crane in the sky, and they therefore thought that we came from the sky. As soon as
                  they saw <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, who was with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, they all came out of
                  hiding and assumed new life, as they knew no squaw ever accompanies a war party.
                  We smoked with them, and then dropped down the stream. We landed, and were joined
                  by many natives who brought us some fire wood — which was very acceptable,
                  for none is to be found about. Cruzatte and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">George Gibson</name> played the violins which delighted
                  them greatly.</p>

               <p>We breakfasted on dog flesh and then set out. Some of the natives have white men's
                  clothes which they have traded for from the coast tribes. On Memaloose Island we
                  saw a place where the Indians deposit their dead. There was a frame of boards and
                  old canoes sixty feet long and twelve feet wide. There were a great number of
                  human bones covered with mats, fish nets, various kinds of trinkets, etc., heaped
                  with them.</p>

               <p>Having no wood, we could not cook our breakfast. John <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> made some excellent beer from the camas root
                  bread which had become wet and soured from our past accidents. We passed on down
                  until we came to a large [Owyhee] rapid which we halted to examine. All who could
                  not swim walked on shore. After passing this rapid we came to a small river which
                  we named "<name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name>" [John
                  Day River], after one of our Frenchmen. We came to some natives and purchased from
                  them a little wood to cook our dog meat and fish. The natives all have <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">pierced nose</name>s and do not
                  receive us with the same cordiality as the natives above did. From the last rapid
                  we saw Mount Hood.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>O<hi rend="smallcaps">CTOBER</hi> 22.</head>
               <p>We pressed on, and came to a very considerable rapid where an immense body of
                  water was compressed into a narrow channel two hundred yards wide. Two miles above
                  this we had passed a [Des Chutes] river. At the [Celilo] falls we landed and
                  walked down to find the best route for a portage. We took every article except the
                  canoes across the portage where we formed a camp in a suitable position to protect
                  our stores from theft. The Indians with their horses helped us carry the heavy
                  articles. We sent two men to examine the river.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>O<hi rend="smallcaps">CTOBER</hi> 23.</head>
               <p>We took the canoes over the portage with much difficulty. One got loose and was
                  caught by the Indians below, whom we had to pay for for its recovery. Our old
                  chief heard the Indians below say that they intended to kill us. We have our arms
                  in order. As these Indians will not sell us their good fish, we purchased eight
                  dogs for the party to eat. We ex.. changed our small canoe and a hatchet and a few
                  articles, for a large, new Indian canoe built for riding the waves. This place is
                  full of fleas so we are obliged to strip naked in order to brush the pests off.
                  The Indians left us earlier than usual, and our chiefs appeared very uneasy this
                  evening with their fears and suspicions of an intended attack.</p>

            <div type="entry">
               <head>O<hi rend="smallcaps">CTOBER</hi> 24.</head>
               <p>The Indians approached our camp with caution. Our two old chiefs are determined to
                  return home, as their nation is at war with the nations below, and they are afraid
                  of being killed. We persuaded them to stay two nights longer with us with a view
                  of making peace. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  and three men went to study the falls, while <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> set out with the land party. It being
                  impossible to portage the canoes around the boiling rapids, we had to ride the
                  canoes through them. We had confidence in our head waterman, Peter Cruzatte, which
                  was well placed. The Indians who watched from the high banks were astonished. The
                  men who could not swim went on shore carrying the goods, guns, ammunition and
                  papers. We proceeded down the channel and landed at a village of twenty-one wooden
                  houses. Here we found <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> and a chief from below with a large party of men. Cruzatte played
                  the violin, and the men danced, which pleased the Indians. We visited their wood
                  houses, the first we had seen since leaving the Illinois. This presented a good
                  opportunity to hold a council to make peace — which we are satisfied we
                  accomplished. They furnished us with dogs, cranberries and some of their root
                  bread.</p>

            <div type="entry">
               <head>O<hi rend="smallcaps">CTOBER</hi> 25.</head>
               <p>The captains walked down to see the place which the Indians say is the best place
                  for passing through the channel. As there was no portage for the canoes, we
                  decided to run the canoes through the long narrows. As usual, the men who could
                  not swim, walked around, carrying the stores. Our best watermen took the canoes
                  through. We stood by with ropes should there be any difficulty. The first three
                  canoes passed through safe, while the fourth nearly filled with water, and the
                  last one passed through shipping only a little water. We are grateful and pleased
                  that we have passed the worst part of the river. We loaded the canoes and set out,
                  but one of the canoes struck a rock and was in danger of being lost. We came to a
                  village where we met our old chiefs and a party with whom we smoked and gave a
                  medal. The old chiefs parted with us at this place. They had purchased a horse
                  each, and intended to return to their villages on the [Clearwater] river. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a deer and saw
                  much sign of others. We formed a rock fort for defense should the Indians decide
                  to attack us. They are in the habit of collecting a levy from all who pass this
                  part of the Columbia.</p>

               <p>We sent six men to hunt deer and collect rosin to patch the canoes which have
                  become very leaky from being hauled over the rocks. We are drying our stores while
                  the canoes were drawn out and turned over. Many of the articles are spoiled from
                  repeated wetting. We were visited by some chiefs from above the falls who were out
                  hunting at the time we passed over the falls. We gave them medals, paint, knives,
                  etc., and acknowledged them as chiefs. Cruzatte played the violin as they sat
                  around our fire, and <name type="person" key="York">York</name> danced for them
                  –which pleased them exceedingly. Our hunters returned with five deer. One of
                  our guards gigged a salmon trout which we thought the most delicious fish we had
                  ever tasted. We dried all our articles and repaired the canoes. The fleas bother
                  us as we do not have a change of clothing. The party amused themselves by dancing
                  at night. This lay-over enabled the captains to take observations and vocabularies
                  of this nation.</p>

               <p>We sent out the hunters-this morning. They brought back four deer and a pheasant.
                  These chiefs and party continue with us. We treat them well and feed and smoke
                  with them. They were joined by seven others from below who wanted to take
                  liberties with our goods, and after we declined being taken advantage of, they
                  returned down the river in ill humor. Soon the chiefs decided to go home, and we
                  put them across the river. These natives flatten their heads by compressing them
                  between boards when infants.</p>

               <p>Some Indians came down from the village above. One had a round hat, others a
                  musket and a sword, and brass tea kettles of which they were very proud. We
                  purchased five dogs, some dried berries and a white bread made of roots. We laid
                  by because of the high wind, but this wind did not deter the natives at all, as
                  their canoes are designed to ride the highest waves. Our hunters killed a
                  deer.</p>

               <p>We set out at daylight and went to a village five miles down. The people here are
                  very friendly, and gave us filbert nuts, pounded fish and root bread. We gave the
                  women pieces of ribbon which pleased them. We purchased twelve dogs of them, and
                  then went to another village where we obtained four more dogs. We camped near
                  another village where they gave us high-bush cranberries, roots, etc. They were
                  pleased with the music of Cruzatte's violin. We had passed a river on the left
                  which we called "<name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>'s
                  River" [Hood River], after our fine waterman.</p>

               <p>After a light breakfast on venison, we set out. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and two men went on an old Indian path
                  to view the Cascades which we found were impossible to pass without a portage.

                  friendly. He got some berries and nuts, but could get no information as to traders
                  who visit them. It rained all day. One of the hunters killed a deer. We named a

                  and wooden, carved images. These things we do not touch. <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> killed a sand-hill crane, then the

                  We brought down the two other large canoes and the small one. Towards evening we

                     <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> killed a large buck and

                  — a considerable stream. We see Mt. Hood to the south-east of us. We landed
                  on the north side of an [Government] island and encamped. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and some others went hunting. An
                  Indian woman of the Snake nation came to visit us, but <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> could not converse with her sufficiently well

                  and three men set out after night in search of swans, ducks and geese which appear
                  in great numbers in a lake on this island. They got several on which we had a

               <p>We set out at 8:30 a.m., having dispatched four men in the small canoe to hunt.
                  Later we landed at a large village and were treated very kindly by the natives.
                  They gave us a round root about the size of a hen's egg. They roast them and call
                  them "wappato." Many Indians visit us and have more European trinkets than the
                  natives above. Some Indians arrived and are armed with pistols, war axes and ready
                  sprung bows and arrows. They are a sort of middlemen between the coast tribes and
                  those above. They were assuming and disagreeable. However, we smoked with them and
                  treated them with friendship. They stole a great coat from one of the interpreters
                  which we later found stuffed under the root of a tree. They also stole the
                  pipe-tomahawk of <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  — which we never found. We saw crab apples and raspberries. The hunters got
                  two deer and some ducks.</p>

               <p>The noise made by the swans, geese and ducks on the lake kept us awake last night.
                  We set out at sunrise and the river began to widen out. We dined at an island and
                  the hunters obtained many fowl. We made thirty-two miles today and then camped.
                  Tonight is the first time since our arrival on the Columbia that we have been free
                  of Indians.</p>

               <p>It is a cold, wet morning. We set out early and passed the Cowlitz River. We
                  overtook some Indians in canoes with articles to sell. We purchased wappato roots,
                  salmon-trout and two beaver skins. They spoke a few words of English and told us
                  that they traded with a man named Mr. Haley. We camped on the south side of the
                  river under a cliff of rocks.</p>

               <p>We set out early in a fog so thick that we could not see the other side of the
                  river. We passed a village where we bought some fish, wappato roots, three dogs
                  and two otter skins, for which we gave fish-hooks. After remaining an hour and a
                  half, we set out, piloted by an Indian to the main channel of the river. We then
                  passed down to another village where <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> purchased two beaver skins to make a robe, as the one he
                  has is rotten and worthless. We proceeded on twelve miles and encamped near a fine
                  spring under a high hill opposite Pillar Rock. Two Indians accompanied us from the
                  last village and were sent off after we detected them stealing a knife. Our small
                  canoe, which got separated this morning in the fog, joined us this evening. Great
                  joy in camp! We are in view of the ocean which we have been so long anxious to
                  see.</p>

               <p>We changed our wet clothes, so did not set off until 9 a.m. We went past several
                  islands in the bay which here is five or six miles wide. We coasted along an inlet
                  we call "Shallow Bay" [Gray's Bay]. We avoided an old Indian village for they are
                  usually full of fleas. We took advantage of the returning tide to go to a point on
                  the right, but the waves ran high, and several of the men became sea-sick. We
                  camped on a point and raised our baggage on poles to keep it above the tide. We
                  passed a disagreeable night — the rain never ceased.</p>

               <p>The tide did not come into our camp, but the canoes, exposed to the waves, were
                  filled. With great attention we saved them until the tide left them dry. When the
                  tide returned it brought large tree-trunks and tossed them in such a manner as to
                  endanger our canoes. Our camp was under water, and every man was wet.
                  Notwithstanding our disagreeable situation, we must spend another night here, for
                  the waves are too high to proceed. The men are cheerful and anxious to see further
                  into the ocean.</p>

                  again, when we landed in a small niche on the lee side of Point Ellice. We secured
                  our canoes as best we could, and made a camp on a pile of drift logs.</p>

                  We sent <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">John Collins</name> to hunt. We purchased
                  thirteen salmon-trout from the Indians. The hunters returned and reported that the
                  hills are covered with fallen timber and underbrush so thick they could not go any
                  distance. Some of the men caught fifteen fine fish.</p>

                     <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> below in our Indian

               <p>The wind blew hard and one canoe was broken by the waves dashing her against the
                  rocks. About 11 a.m., five Indians came up through the immense waves and informed
                  us that they had seen our three men, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and
                     <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, some distance below.
                  Soon afterwards, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> arrived by

                  not find a harbor nor any signs of white people. He had found two camps of Indians
                  below, and that these Indians now with us had taken his gig, basket and knife. We
                  forcefully took them back, and ordered them off. At 3 p.m. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.

                  informed us is at no great distance below. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' object is to find a small bay as
                  laid down by Vancouver. The canoe returned, half full of water which was dashed
                  over her while passing the point, having landed <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and his party safely on the beach

               <p>This morning was cold and fair which gave us an opportunity to dry our bedding and
                  examine the baggage — the greater part of which is wet. We put our goods in

                  The natives with him are rogues; the night before they had stolen both <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>'s and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s guns. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> told these Indians
                  that if any of their nation stole anything from us that he would have them shot.
                  They understood his meaning very well. As the tide rises here, we concluded to
                  form a camp at the highest place. The evening is fair and the men are comfortable
                  in the camps they have made from some old boards which they found in an abandoned

                  brought in eight large ducks. Afterwards we came to a river, made a raft, and

                  One of the Indians had a robe made of two sea-otter skins. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> offered him many articles for the

               <p>We sent out six hunters while the captains made observations on this fair day. We
                  dried our wet bedding and articles. We took a vote of the men as to the location
                  for our winter quarters. Some are for investigating the other side of the Columbia
                  for a suitable site — while others prefer a camp upriver near the falls, or
                  at least up the river where it is less rainy. <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> is in favor of a place where there are plenty of wappato. The
                  vote resulted: 5 for the falls, 12 for the Seal [Washougal] River, and 12 for
                  across the Columbia. Therefore <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> and another man will cross to the other side to see if good
                  hunting is there, for we cannot depend on the natives for food. We prefer to be
                  near the harbor in the event a ship will come this winter. The advantage of
                  procuring goods from a vessel would off-set living on poor deer and elk higher up

                     <name type="person" key="York">York</name> came up — we then proceeded
                  around Meriwether's Bay [Young's Bay]. This we named for <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> who was no doubt the first white
                  man to ever survey this bay. We ascended a river [the Netul –now Lewis and
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s] to a high point of
                  land with a thick growth of trees. It is certainly the most eligible situation for
                  our purpose of any in the neighborhood. Here we intend to build a fort for our
                  winter quarters.</p>

                  out to find the nearest route to the ocean to find a place to make salt, and to
                  make a road so that the men out hunting might find their way should they get lost
                  in fog or bad weather. They passed through bogs and open lands, and discovered a
                  band of elk. They obtained one and made a shelter of the skin — and dined on
                  the flesh, refreshed by a tolerable fire. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> with eleven men went in canoes to bring in the
                  meat that the hunters had killed. They carried two large loads to the canoes and

                  — and a small sea-otter skin which we purchased for a few fish-hooks and
                  some Indian tobacco. We finished raising one line of huts.</p>

               <p>The Indians left us after a breakfast of elk meat of which they are very fond. The

                  them as well as a panther skin. We gave them some soft and mouldy salmon which
                  they prize very highly. We sent a little pounded fish to Chief <name type="person" key="Cus-ka-lah">Cuscalar</name> who is sick at his village and could not come

                  little. They then offered a woman to us which we declined — which also

                  finished a wide slab which he had hewed level for the captains to use as a writing

                  it. We have nothing else but a little pounded fish which we purchased at the Great

               <p>After breakfast we divided half of our remaining twelve carrots of tobacco among

                  and our dinner consisted of poor elk and a few roots— with no salt to season
                  that. But we are in good health, which we esteem more than all the ardent spirits

                  arrive and bring roots, mats and dressed elk skins. We purchased some roots, two

                  freckles. His father was an English sailor, and this young man has "Jack Ramsay"
                  tattooed on his arm. He did not speak English and had all the habits of the
                  Indians.</p>

               <p>Our party fired a volley of small arms to usher in the New Year. This is the only
                  mark of respect we have to offer on this celebrated day. Our repast, though better
                  than that of Christmas, consisted principally in anticipation of that which we
                  would have next year, when we hope to be with our friends and families. At present
                  we are content with boiled elk, wappato roots and pure water. We are uneasy that
                     <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name>, who were dispatched with the
                  salt makers, and who were to immediately return, have not yet done so. We sent two
                  men out hunting.</p>
               <p>Our fort being completed, our commanding officers direct that the guard shall
                  consist of one sergeant and three privates, and that the same shall be changed at
                  sunrise. The post of the new guard shall be in the room of the sergeant
                  respectfully commanding the same. It shall be the duty of the sentinel to announce
                  the arrival of Indians to the sergeant of the guard, who shall immediately report
                  the same to the commanding officers. The garrison is charged to treat the natives
                  in a friendly manner, nor are they at any time to abuse or strike them, unless
                  such abuse be first given by the natives. The sergeant of the guard, assisted by
                  Charbonneau, may evict any native who insists on remaining in the rooms or fort
                  — unless they have been invited to remain. It shall be the duty of the guard
                  to keep the key of the meat-house and visit the canoes to see that they are safely
                  secured. All must mount guard but the interpreters and cooks. All are to return
                  tools after use, and in no case are any to be kept out all night. Only <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> is excepted from the
                  rules regarding tools.</p>
               <p>The hunters killed two elk about three miles from the fort.</p>

               <p>We were visited by our neighbor, Chief Comowool, and six Clatsops. They brought
                  roots, berries and three dogs, and some fresh blubber. Our original aversion to
                  dog meat has long since been overcome. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s, <name type="person" key="Potts, John">John Potts</name>

                  but only got enough to sustain themselves. This teaches us the necessity of
                  keeping out several parties of hunters in order to supply us against any
                  emergency. We sent Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and

               <p>At 5 p.m. <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name> returned. They had not been
                  lost, but informed us that it was not until the 5th day, before they could find a
                  suitable place to make salt. They brought some of the blubber from the whale that
                  was stranded near the salt works. We found that it tasted something like beaver or
                  dog, only somewhat more coarse. They also told us that <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>, William <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">George Gibson</name> had erected a comfortable camp and
                  had a good store of meat, and made three to four quarts of salt a day. They
                  brought back about a gallon. We found it strong and white and a great treat, for
                  we have not had any salt since December 20th. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> seems indifferent about it, and he also
                  does not care for dog meat. He can get along without either. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">John Collins</name> came back from an unsuccessful hunt.
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> determined to set

                  observed that she had traveled a long way with us to see the Great Waters, and now
                  that a monstrous fish was to be seen, she thought it very hard not to he permitted
                  to see either, for she had not yet been to the ocean. Therefore we indulged her to
                  go.</p>
               <p>Those at the fort overhauled the merchandise and dried it before the fires. The
                  humidity is excessive, and we have not been able to keep anything dry. Our
                  merchandise is reduced to a mere handful, and our success on our return across the
                  country depends on it. Therefore we must regret the reduced state of this fund of
                  supplies.</p>

                  after arriving in the bay, found the waves so high that they put into a small
                  creek, left the canoes, and went overland. We killed an elk and finally made the
                  shore. We made fires of driftwood and spent the night. It is clear, with a full
                  moon — the first we have seen in months. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name> reached the salt makers' camp.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> found a beaver and
                  an otter in his traps. The beaver was large and fat, and we dined sumptuously on
                  it. Also it was a prize, for being a full grown male, it had the glands which are
                  used for scent and bait to trap others. It being a fine day, we dried our lodge
                  tent and put it away under shelter.</p>
               <p>In <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s party we all ate

                  across in a canoe, for which service he gave two fish hooks. We went on two miles
                  where we found the salt makers, and among them Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>,
                     <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>. They have a neat camp,
                  convenient to wood and water. They are also situated near the houses of the
                  Clatsops and Tillamooks who are very kind to them. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> hired a native to guide us to the

                     <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> went with us. We
                  went two and one-half miles over slippery stones to a high hill [Tillamook Head].
                  The guide said we had to cross the hill, so we went on a very bad trail to the
                  top. Here we met fourteen Indians loaded with blubber. We left the top of the
                  precipice and camped on a small creek, all much fatigued.</p>

                  computing the distances, we went down a steep descent to the beach. We proceeded
                  on some two miles to where the whale was stranded. It was already stripped of its
                  meat and we found only the skeleton of the monster. It measures 105 feet long. We
                  returned to the village where the Tillamooks were boiling the blubber, and we
                  traded our goods for some three hundred pounds of it and four gallons of oil
                  — which we prize highly. While smoking with the Indians there was an outcry,
                  and the guide informed us that someone had been killed. On examination, we found
                  that <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">Hugh McNeal</name> was absent. Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and four men were
                  dispatched, and they met <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name> on a

               <p>This evening we finished curing the meat. We have plenty at present and a little
                  salt. Our huts are dry and comfortable. We have decided to remain here until the
                  1st of April, and everyone seems content with his situation and fare. It is true
                  that we could travel now as far as the Falls of the Columbia, but the Indians
                  inform us that the snows are deep in the basin above, and it would be madness for
                  us to proceed, as there is no game nor fuel to be found there at this time of
                  year.</p>

               <p>This morning we were visited by <name type="person" key="Coboway">Comowool</name>
                  and seven of our nearest neighbors, the Clatsops. They left later in the evening.
                  They had brought some roots and berries for which they asked such high prices
                  which our poor stock in trade would not permit us giving. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> was sent to hunt and he shortly returned

                  by some Clatsops who brought some sea-otter skins. We purchased one, giving in
                  return the remainder of our blue beads. We also purchased a small quantity of
                  whale oil and a hat, for brass arm bands and some fish-hooks. These hats are made

                  crab apple tree excessively hard when seasoned, and is very good for making

               <p>Our fare is lean elk meat with a little salt. Though we used it sparingly, the

                  will rob us of it. At 4 p.m. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> returned with his party. They brought with them the flesh of four

                  meat, also returned and brought all the salt that had been made, consisting of
                  only a bushel, despite the fact that the kettles had been kept boiling night and
                  day. This salt making is tedious business. We calculate that we will need three

                  with a most acceptable supply of fat sturgeon and about a thousand fresh eulachon,

               <p>Two of our canoes have been injured by standing on shore at ebb tide. We had them

                  We count the days until April 1st which binds us here at Fort Clatsop. The men are

               <p>Our fare is better, as the fish and wappato are not yet all gone. The fish soon
                  spoil unless they are pickled or smoked, but in our case, there is little danger

                  returned from the [Young's] river. They report the elk have gone to the mountains.

                  arrived this morning in a small canoe loaded with fish. Some dogs at the fishing

                  borrowed a canoe of the Indians and made his return, but enroute he found his own
                  canoe and made her fast. Until we return, she will be secure until we recover it,
                  and then will return the borrowed one to the Indians. We sent Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> to search for the canoe which was

                  were visited by a chief and his wife, with six women of the tribe, which the old

                  the traders who visit this coast. It would have been fortunate if some trader had
                  arrived before our departure, for we would have been able to add to our stock of
                  merchandise and therefore could have made a more comfortable homeward bound
                  journey. We hope the men will be in better health traveling than they have been
                  while stationary. <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and
                     <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> remain weak. We
                  found the guns of <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>
                  and Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> were out of
                  order. Fortunately we had taken the precaution to bring duplicate parts, and with
                  the skill of <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>, they
                  were repaired. Now all are in good order.</p>

               <p>As we could not set out because of the weather, we sent Shields and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> to hunt. They returned
                  unsuccessful, so we have not more than one day's provisions on hand. We directed
                     <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the two
                  Fields brothers to set out tomorrow early to endeavor to provide us with some

                  so reduced that we are uneasy about his recovery. Some natives visited us and we

                  brothers left early this morning as per orders. We sent seven hunters in different
                  directions to hunt. We were visited by some Indians of whom we bought some dried
                  fish and a dog for our sick men. We presented to <name type="person" key="Coboway">Comowool</name> our Fort Clatsop and its furniture, for he has been more kind
                  to us than any other Indian in the vicinity. In the evening they bade us farewell
                  and we did not see them again. All the hunters returned unsuccessful except <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name>, who did not return. We

               <p>At 9 a.m. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> arrived, having
                  killed an elk, but at such distance that we could not send for it. We distributed
                  the baggage and directed the canoes to be loaded. At 1 p.m. we bid final adieu to
                  Fort Clatsop. We had not gone more than a mile when we were met by Chief <name type="person" key="Delashelwilt">Delashelwilt</name> and a party of twenty
                  Chinooks. He brought a canoe for sale, but as we were already supplied, we did not
                  purchase it. By 6 p.m. we had doubled Point William and arrived at a small creek
                  [John Day] where we found our hunters. They had killed two elk one and one-half
                  miles away. We encamped here for the night. We have five canoes; three large ones
                  and two small ones.</p>

               <head>M<hi rend="smallcaps">ARCH</hi> 24.</head>
               <p>We sent fourteen men under Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> to bring in the elk. They soon returned. We breakfasted, and
                  then departed at 9:30 a.m., except for Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>' canoe, which was left aground by the tide. In
                  two hours he and his crew were able to set off, and they overtook us at a village
                  where we had halted. <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>
                  and <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> are still weak.
                  The party proceeded on. Enroute among the Seal Islands we mistook our way, which
                  was observed by an Indian, who put us into the correct channel. He claimed the
                  canoe we had taken from the Clatsops as his property, and we compromised by giving
                  him an elk skin with which he was perfectly satisfied. We encamped at an old
                  Indian village on the south side of the Columbia.</p>

               <p>This morning was cold, and the wind and current were against us, so we made slow
                  progress. We landed at noon [near Clifton, Oregon] where we were joined by some
                  Clatsops. Later we crossed over to the north side, and late in the evening we
                  reached a spot fit for a camp. Here we found <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields brothers who had been
                  separated from us since morning.</p>

               <p>We met a chief of distinction, Wallalle, to whom we gave a medal and invested it
                  with the usual ceremonies. He was grateful and gave us a large sturgeon. We were
                  overtaken by two Indians who had two dogs to trade for tobacco, but we are not
                  disposed to trade this, as we have only three carrots left. Our men appear to
                  suffer from the want of it and are now reduced to substitute the bark of the wild
                  crab apple, which they chew. Our hunters joined us here, having killed three
                  eagles and a large goose. We walked on shore on Fanny's Island, which <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> named in honor of his
                  sister, Frances. We camped on an island [Grimm's] in the evening.</p>

               <p>We set out early, and were soon joined by some Indians with fish and roots for
                  sale. At 10 a.m. we stopped at some houses of Indians where we found <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields
                  brothers. They had not returned to our camp last night. These people gave us as
                  much food as we could eat of dried fish, wappato, sturgeon and other roots. We
                  sent <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and Gibson in
                  two small canoes with six hunters ahead to Deer Island in order to kill game by
                  the time we should come up. We made camp this evening at a spot where we had
                  plenty of good wood.</p>

               <p>We set out very early and at 9 a.m. arrived at an old village on Deer Island where
                  we found our hunters, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>.
                  They had killed seven deer and they brought back a remnant of the flesh, for the
                  vultures and eagles had devoured four deer in the course of a few hours. The party
                  killed, and brought in three other deer, a goose, some ducks and a eagle. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> also killed a lynx.
                     <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> informed us that
                  the vultures had dragged a large buck some thirty yards [these vultures must be
                  condors]. The Columbia is now very high, which makes it difficult to ascend.</p>

               <p>At an early hour we proceeded along the side of Deer Island and halted for
                  breakfast at its upper end. We were visited by Indians who spread wappato and
                  fish, and then asked presents in return. We exchanged the skins of the deer killed
                  yesterday for twelve dogs and three sea-otter skins. We camped in a small prairie
                  on the north side. Our sick are getting better.</p>

               <p>We got under way early and passed several fishing villages on Wappato Island.
                  Later we were joined by a fleet of canoes who continued with us some miles for the
                  purpose of looking at us. They are friendly, but had taken the precaution of
                  bringing along their war implements. We camped a little before sunset in a
                  beautiful prairie [near present Vancouver, Washington]. We went out hunting but
                  the game here is very shy.</p>

               <p>We set out early and proceeded, meeting the usual Indians until we came to
                  Quicksand [Sandy] River where we camped. We decided to remain here a day or two to
                  make celestial observations and hunt. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> who was sent to below Seal [Washougal] River, informed us
                  that game was scarce in that quarter.</p>

            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 1, 1806.</head>
               <p>The Indians who followed us yesterday camped near us last night. The captains
                  asked them questions relative to their country. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> was sent with two men to examine the
                  Quicksand River. He ascended it some six miles and reported that, as the Indians
                  had said, it rises near Mount Hood. This causes us to believe that there must be a
                  larger river which drains this vast area. We have not seen such a river, and the
                  Indians gave us no indication of any such stream. While we were making these
                  inquiries, a number of canoes arrived. These new people told us that they lived up
                  river at the Great Rapids and that there was a scarcity of provisions there and
                  above on the plains, there is no game on which we can subsist. After much
                  deliberation, we decided to remain here until we collect enough meat to last us
                  until we reach the Flathead nation. Our hunters returned from the opposite side,
                  having killed two deer and four elk. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and party were sent to bring in the meat. The rest of the hunters
                  are to hunt on this side.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">

               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>' party returned with the
                  elk meat this morning. We sent two parties of nine men to the opposite side. Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> is to go below the [Sandy]
                  river, and four men are to go above. We also sent out three others to hunt on this
                  side. Those who remained in camp are collecting wood and making a scaffold, and
                  are cutting up the meat to dry it. Among our visitors were two young men who
                  reside at the falls of a large river which discharges itself into the Columbia
                  from the south side some miles below us. They drew us a map, and it appeared that
                  this [Multnomah; Willamette] river comes in behind an island. We had passed this
                  island on the opposite side both coming and going, and therefore did not see this
                  river. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> determined to
                  return, and took seven men : <name type="person" key="Potts, John">John
                     Potts</name>, <name type="person" key="Whitehouse, Joseph">Joseph
                     Whitehouse</name>, Peter Cruzatte, John <name type="person" key="Thompson, John B.">Thompson</name>, <name type="person" key="Howard, Thomas P.">Thomas Howard</name>, <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Peter Weiser</name> and <name type="person" key="York">York</name> in one of the canoes, and set off at 11:30 a.m. In exchange for a
                  looking-glass he hired one of the natives to pilot him, and took the man on
                  board.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> shot the air gun
                  for the natives about camp which much astonished them. As he had only 10 men in
                  camp — the others all being out hunting or with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> took the precaution to awe and
                  command respect from these Indians.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and party stopped at a
                  village with the hope of purchasing wappato. The natives were sulky and refused to
                  sell any. With a portfire match [a sort of slow burning artillery fuze] and his
                  compass and a magnet, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  made a demonstration. The match was placed in the fire which made it burn
                  vehemently and changed the color of the fire. The magnet was used to turn the
                  needle of the compass briskly. This apparent magic astonished and alarmed the
                  Indians who then quickly lay before him some wappato, and begged him to take out
                  the bad fire. At this moment the match burned out and the fire returned to normal
                  — and he put away the compass and magnet. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> then smoked with them and gave them
                  articles in exchange for the wappato — and went on. The party entered the
                  Multnomah and camped on the stream. They discovered a high mountain south of Mount
                  Hood which they had not seen before, and named it Mount <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">Jefferson</name>.</p>

               <p>A considerable number of Indians crowded about <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' camp. They all confirm the report
                  of scarcity of food above. This morning <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and himself, killed four elk. As the party was weak, and
                  some thirty-seven Indians were about, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> thought it best to send a few men to the other side of the
                  river and dry the meat there. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and two men returned with <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> for that purpose. His hunters were ordered to continue
                  the hunt, while the others are employed drying meat.</p>

                  party returned from the Multnomah River. During the morning he had ascended that
                  stream some miles [to near present Portland, Oregon] and then returned. He met an
                  intelligent Indian who drew a sketch of the courses of the river and the island
                  which guards it. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  copied these in his notes. He purchased five dogs and returned to base.</p>

                  search of Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>' party below

                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> brought the flesh of a
                  bear and some venison. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> who
                  had killed the bear, found the den of another in which there were three cubs. Sgt.

                  that we feared it would not keep. «e therefore directed that it be cut thinner and
                  redried over a fire this evening — as we propose to set off in the morning.
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> returned with <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>, and brought the three cubs. We exchanged
                  them with the Indians for wappato roots.</p>

               <p>We had the dried meat secured in skin bags, and all the canoes loaded. We departed
                  at 9 a.m. and went along the north shore to near the place where we had camped on
                  November 3rd. We met with our hunters previously sent up. They had killed three
                  elk this morning and wounded two others which they expect to get. We therefore
                  determined to camp here in order to dry the meat. We sent out a search party and
                  employed others in building scaffolds and collecting firewood. The search party
                  returned in the evening with five elk. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> found the two wounded ones and killed
                  them. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s killed a bird
                  of the quail type, while <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name>
                  got a pheasant, and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>
                  killed a condor. Our supply of elk, in addition to the roots and dogs we can
                  probably procure, will, by using economy, be sufficient to last us to the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>. There we shall
                  meet with our horses, and near that place there are deer to be procured. We direct
                  that fires be kept under the meat all night.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields
                  brothers were sent ahead to hunt. The flesh of the remaining elk was brought in,
                  and our dried meat was put in elkskin bags for an early departure. We had the men
                  test the guns by shooting, and found that several had faulty sights. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> rectified them in the
                  course of the day. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  prevailed upon an old Indian to mark on the sand a sketch of the Multnomah River's
                  upper reaches — and his map corresponded with the others we had been given.
                  He also laid down the Clackamas River for us. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> returned this evening stating that
                  the game had been scared off above.</p>

               <p>The wind blew so hard that we had to unload the canoes. Being obliged to remain
                  here all day, we sent out <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>,
                     <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> to hunt. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> walked down the river to botanize.
                  Shields cut out <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s
                  rifle and brought her to shoot very well.<ref target="nch2101" n="1"/> Our party
                  owes much to the ingenuity of this man, by whom our guns are repaired when they
                  get out of order, which is very often. About 1 p.m., <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>
                  returned, and soon afterwards <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> came in — all with little success. The violent waves
                  split one of our canoes before we could get her out of the water. Late at night
                  the sentinel detected an old Indian trying to creep into our camp to steal. He was
                  one of the six who lay encamped a couple of hundred yards below us. They all
                  departed after our sentinel had discovered and alarmed them.</p>

               <p>We reloaded our canoes and set out at 7 a.m., and proceeded to pick up the Fields
                  brothers. They had not killed any game. We did not stop, but continued to the
                  village located on the north side about a mile below Beacon Rock. Here we halted
                  and took breakfast. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name>
                  observed the tomahawk in one of the lodges which had been stolen from Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> on the 4th of November last.
                  The natives attempted to wrest the tomahawk from <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, but he retained it and thus retook our
                  property. They denied stealing it, etc. With some difficulty we obtained five dogs
                  and a few wappato. At 2 p.m. we set out and arrived at the first rapid. We found a
                  good harbor and encamped. We saw deer sign, so sent <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> to hunt in the morning while the canoes were
                  towed above the rapids. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s
                  crew were directed to delay for <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and to collect rosin from the pine trees near our camp.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 10.</head>
               <p>We drew up our canoes by cords which was soon accomplished. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> not vet having come over, we directed Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> to remain with the cord to assist them
                  in bringing their canoe up the rapid. Above, the current is so strong that it
                  required five oars to make progress. We breakfasted at a village. Here they had a
                  sheep-skin. The head and horns had been formed into a cap which was worn as a
                  highly prized ornament. We obtained the cap for a knife, and gave two elk skins
                  for the sheep skin.<ref target="nch2102" n="2"/> At 10 a.m. we were joined by Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> who had brought up their canoe and had
                  killed three deer. We set out and continued on the north side of the river. As we
                  had only one tow-rope, we could only take one canoe at a time. By evening we
                  arrived at the portage where we landed, and conveyed our baggage to the top of a
                  hill where we formed a camp. We had the canoes drawn on shore and secured. One
                  small one got loose from <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields brothers. The Indians in the lower village
                  brought her up this evening, for which honesty we gave them a couple of
                  knives.</p>

               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 11.</head>
               <p>It rained all night, and our tents and skins which covered the men were wet. Our
                  portage around the Cascades is 2800 yards long on a narrow, rough and slippery
                  road. The duty of getting the canoes above the rapids was delegated to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, who took all but <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>, who is so weak as to be
                  unable to walk, and three others lamed by various accidents, and one other to cook
                  for the party. A few men were absolutely necessary to guard our baggage from the
                  thieving Indians who crowded our camp in considerable numbers. These people are
                  the greatest scoundrels we have met with. One had the insolence to cast stones at
                  our men as they were walking on the portage road.</p>
               <p> By evening, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> took four
                  of the canoes above the rapids. They were much damaged by being driven against the
                  rocks despite every precaution we took. The river appears to be some twenty-five
                  feet higher than when we descended it last fall. On the return of our party in the
                  evening from the head of the rapids, our men met several natives on the road. John
                  Shields who has delayed to purchase a dog and was some distance behind, was
                  accosted by two Indians who attempted to take the dog from him and pushed him out
                  of the road. Shields, having no other weapon, pulled his knife, and the Indians
                  fled through the woods. These Indians stole <name type="person" key="Seaman">Scannon</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                  Lewis</name>' dog. Three men were sent in pursuit of the thieves, who discovered
                  the party, and left the dog and fled. They also stole an axe, but John <name type="person" key="Thompson, John B.">Thompson</name> detected the act and
                  wrested it from them. We informed them by signs that if they made any further
                  attempts, or insulted our men, that we would put them to death. We are concerned
                  for future travelers; no other consideration but our numbers protected us. We kept
                  on constant guard, and our men are disposed to kill a few of them. This evening we
                  sent <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields
                  brothers a few miles up the river to the entrance of Cruzatte's River [Wind River]
                  to hunt until our arrival.</p>

               <p>Though it rained all of last night and this morning, we determined to haul the
                  remaining canoe beyond the rapids. At one place the current sets with great
                  velocity against a projecting rock, and in hauling the canoe around this point the
                  current turned her side to the stream, and despite the utmost exertions, we were
                  compelled to loose the cord, so both canoe and cord went adrift into the stream.
                  After breakfast all hands were employed in taking the baggage over the portage.
                  The men who had short rifles carried them to protect our baggage from robbery or
                  injury. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and some
                  other men were employed the greater part of the day in repairing and calking the
                  canoes. We remained all night at the upper end of the portage.</p>

               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 13.</head>
               <p>The loss of one of our canoes rendered it necessary to distribute her crew and
                  cargo among the remaining canoes. This being done we set out at 8 a.m. We found
                  the additional lading made our vessels hard to manage and unsafe in the event of
                  high winds. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> with
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and Gibson went
                  in two small canoes, to a friendly village where they were able to purchase two
                  additional canoes, four paddles and three dogs. He gave them two buffalo robes,
                  four elk skins and some deer skins in exchange. His party crossed to the south
                  side where later he found <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name>'s party with the large canoes. They reported they had seen nothing
                  of <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields
                  brothers who had been sent ahead to hunt. We directed Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> to take the canoes just purchased, for his
                  mess and the loading which we had carried in the lost canoe, and to have these
                  canoes dried and pitched with rosin. We sent Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> back up Cruzatte's [Wind] River in
                  search of the hunters with two men and an empty canoe to bring back any meat they
                  may have killed. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name>
                  returned after 6 p.m. with two deer. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> had been hunting with Shields.</p>

               <p>This morning we were joined by Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, his two men and the three hunters
                  — <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, Reuben and
                     <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>. They brought four
                  deer which <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> had
                  killed yesterday. After breakfast we departed and kept along the north shore all
                  day. At noon we halted at a village where we purchased five dogs, some roots,
                  filberts and dried berries. Our men prefer fat dog meat to lean venison. After
                  nooning, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and
                  Charbonneau walked on shore, and rejoined the party some six miles upstream. We
                  camped on a small run [near present <name type="native_nation" key="White Salmon Indians">White Salmon</name>, Washington].</p>

               <p>We delayed this morning to purchase some horses from the Indians, but they were
                  unwilling to barter, so we gathered up our merchandise and at 8 a.m. we set out.
                  The captains halted a few minutes at the Sepulcher Rock to examine the deposits of
                  dead at that place. We then proceeded along the north shore and arrived at another
                  village where we tried to purchase horses. All we could get were two dogs. We
                  continued on until evening when we camped on a [Mill] creek, where we had camped
                  for two days last fall. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and some others went to hunt and brought back a deer.</p>

                  He also purchased three dogs and some onions to feed his party, and some roots for
                  himself. Charbonneau purchased a mare for which he gave some ermine, elk's teeth,
                  a belt and some other articles.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Captain Lewis</name> loaded his canoes
                  and set off for the opposite side — transporting a few Indians who lived
                  there. The party had to portage a short rapid and they drew up the canoes by the
                  cord, assisted by setting poles. From here we proceeded to the basin below the
                  Long Narrows and landed. After unloading the canoes and arranging camp, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> walked to the Skilloot
                  village and joined <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>. He
                  had procured four horses for which a high price had to be paid — at least
                  double that we had given the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name>. These were taken by Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> to <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' camp. At 3 p.m. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> with three men arrived from the
                  camp below with elk skins and a few articles including Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s two coats, and four buffalo robes belonging
                  to the men. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> dressed
                  the sores of the principal chief and left some medicine to cure his eyes. He also
                  doctored the chief's wife by rubbing some camphor on her temples and back, and she
                  felt restored. This presented a favorable opportunity to trade with the chief, and
                  he sold us two horses. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> obtained a horse in exchange for a large kettle. We determined to
                  make the portage to the head of the Long Narrows with our baggage and five small
                  canoes. We could not take the two large ones any further, and therefore cut them
                  up for fuel—much to the chagrin of the natives who would give us absolutely
                  nothing for them, as they expected to get them free. In the evening the captains
                  returned to the camp at the basin, and left <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, <name type="person" key="Werner, William">Werner</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>
                  with the merchandise at the upper village at the request of the natives, who
                  promised to give us horses for it in the morning. Many natives resort here for
                  trade, most of whom are troubled with sore eyes, and the older men are nearly all
                  blind.</p>

               <p>This morning we had our small canoes drawn from the water, and all hands are
                  employed in transporting our baggage on the backs of our four horses. We
                  accomplished this labor by 3 p.m. and established our camp above the Skilloot
                  village. We obtained four more horses today — trading two of our kettles. We
                  now have only one small kettle to a mess of eight men. In the evening <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> set out with Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, Cruzatte and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> to the village at the Grand Falls
                  in order to trade for horses. The people here are faithless in their contracts,
                  for they frequently trade, and then later demand more, or revoke the exchange.
                  They have pilfered several small articles from us this evening. We directed that
                  the horses be hobbled and grazed at a little distance from our camp under the care
                  of our men. <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> was
                  negligent and suffered his horse to ramble off. It was not found when we ordered
                  them up to be picketed. All except one are stallions and were restless all
                  night.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 20.</head>
               <p>This morning we were informed that the natives had stolen six tomahawks and a
                  knife in the course of the night — and some spoons during the day. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> spoke to the chief on
                  the subject — but the property was not restored. The horse which <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> had purchased —
                  and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> had let get away,
                  was gambled off by the Indian who had sold it, and it had been taken by a man of
                  another nation. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>
                  therefore took the goods back from the Indian. During the day two more indifferent
                  horses were bought. We could not obtain any more, so we resolved to go tomorrow
                  with those we had, and convey the balance of the baggage in two canoes. We
                  therefore had a load made up for seven horses, reserving one for <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> to ride, as he is unable
                  to walk. We bartered two canoes, elk skins and an old piece of iron for beads. As
                  they would not give anything for one canoe, we cut it up for fuel. We hobbled and
                  picketed the horses within the limits of our camp and ordered the Indians away. We
                  informed them that if they attempted to steal anything that we would beat them
                  severely. They went off in a bad humor; we examined our arms and were on
                  guard.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 21.</head>
               <p>Notwithstanding all our precautions, one of our hobbled horses had broken his line
                  and had gone off. We sent several men to search for him—but to return by 10
                  a.m. The Indians stole another tomahawk and the iron socket of a canoe pole. We
                  gave the Indian who had taken the last article several severe blows and had the
                  men kick him out of our camp. This is the first act of the kind on our entire
                  expedition, but we had to do it. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> threatened to shoot any of them who stole, and told them that we
                  were not afraid of them, and that we had it in our power to kill them all and set
                  their houses afire, but it was our wish to treat them with kindness provided they
                  let our property alone. The chiefs who were present hung their heads, but said
                  nothing. At 9 a.m. <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Richard
                     Windsor</name> returned with the lost horse and the other searchers returned
                  also. The Indian who promised to guide us to the Flathead nation produced two
                  horses, one of which he politely permitted <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> to pack. We left at 10 a.m., having
                  nine horses packed—with another one which <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> rode. At 1 p.m. we arrived at the
                  village where we found <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                  Clark</name>. He had been unable to purchase any more horses. We found the man who
                  had won the horse, and he produced another in its stead rather than give back the
                  large kettle and knife we had traded for the horse. We continued on, made the
                  portage with Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s, <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name> in our canoes, and went into camp a little below the [Des Chutes]
                  river. We bought some dogs and purchased another poor horse, and took the
                  precaution of picketing and hobbling the horses near our camp. </p>

               <p>Last night two of our horses broke loose, but they were recovered early. At 7 a.m.
                  we set out, having previously sent our small canoe with <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name>. Soon after we left, Charbonneau's horse threw his load, and
                  taking fright at the saddle and robe which adhered, ran down to the village, where
                  the saddle and robe were disengaged. An Indian hid the robe in his lodge. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> sent the guide and one
                  man to assist Charbonneau to retake the horse, which he did. They found the
                  packsaddle, but the Indian denied seeing the robe. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> sent <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> on to ask <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> to halt, and sent some men back to
                  assist us to make the Indians either return the robe or we would burn his house.
                  Just as <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and party
                  reached the village, <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> met him with the robe which he had found in the lodge hidden
                  behind some trappings. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> now rejoined <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> and party. The captains decided to divide the men afoot, and to
                  march alternately with them each day—one captain in front, and the other at
                  the rear. Thus we proceeded through open country for eight miles when we observed
                  our canoes passing on the opposite shore. The wind being too high for them to
                  cross over, they continued on. We halted to graze the horses and dined on some
                  dogs we had purchased. Here we bought another horse. We went on four miles and
                  camped near a village [near John Day's River]. Charbonneau purchased a horse this
                  evening. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name> passed us in their canoe, but Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s joined us.</p>

            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 23.</head>
               <p>Charbonneau's two horses got away as he had not secured them to pickets as
                  directed. We sent <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s and
                     <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> to assist
                  Charbonneau in finding them. One was found at no great distance, but the other was
                  given up as lost. At 8 a.m. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben
                     Field</name>s and Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>
                  preceded us in their canoe. During our delay for <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> and Charbonneau, we made two
                  packsaddles. We continued our march for twelve miles to a village near the rock
                  rapid. The people here are friendly and sold us four dogs for pewter buttons we
                  had made, and some old pieces of iron and brass. This evening Cruzatte played the
                  violin and the men danced. The canoe parties camped near us.</p>

            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 24.</head>
               <p>We were up early and sent the men in search of the horses. All were found except
                     <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name>'s, which was brought back
                  by a hired Indian about 1 p.m. Meanwhile, we made four packsaddles and purchased
                  three horses, and hired three others of the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> man who accompanies us with his
                  family and horses. Having enough horses for all to travel by land, we sold our
                  canoes for six fathoms of white beads, and loaded up and departed at 2 p.m. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> had to threaten to
                  break up the canoes before the Indians would trade, as they had expected to get
                  them for nothing. Many of our party complain of sore feet caused by the rough
                  stones —having been so long on the soft sand at Fort Clatsop. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' left ankle gives him
                  much pain, but after bathing it in cold water he was relieved. We dined on two
                  dogs and some root bread. We directed that our new horses be picketed, and the
                  others be hobbled, and a strong guard kept.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="entry">
               <head>A<hi rend="smallcaps">PRIL</hi> 25.</head>
               <p>We collected our horses and set out at 9 a.m., and proceeded on eleven miles to a
                  village where we purchased five dogs and some wood — then took dinner. We
                  tried to barter for more horses but were unsuccessful. Most of the Indians' horses
                  have sore backs, but are otherwise generally in good order. We set out and went
                  nine miles, where we found some willows which would answer for fuel, and made
                  camp. Enroute, one of the horses we had hired of the Flathead guide, was taken
                  from <name type="person" key="Hall, Hugh">Hugh Hall</name>, whom <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had directed to ride.
                  After making camp we traded for two horses which the captains intend to ride, as
                  they have been walking in order to permit the sick to ride. We now have a
                  sufficiency of horses to transport with ease all the baggage and the packs of the
                  men. The natives surround us, and we had the fiddle played and some men danced to
                  amuse them.</p>

               <p>We set forward early and rode on twelve miles where we halted to have dinner on
                  the remainder of the dogs and dried elk meat. The captains were obliged to go on
                  foot again this afternoon to let some of the men ride whose feet are very
                  sore.</p>

               <p>Charbonneau's horse strayed again and we were detained until 9 a.m. before we
                  could set out. Our dinner consisted of only dried elk, which is all we have. We
                  were met by the chief of the Wallawallas and we went to his village where we were
                  treated very kindly. <name type="person" key="Yelleppit">Yellept</name>, the
                  chief, harangued his people in our favor for food, and they soon brought us ample,
                  which was most welcome, for we have been on short rations for two days. These
                  people told us of a good road to the [Clearwater] river, said to be level, with
                  game and good water and grass — and eighty miles shorter. We concluded to
                  take this road and to cross our horses over the Columbia River in the morning.</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Yelleppit">Yellept</name> brought a very elegant white
                  horse and presented him to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name>, signifying that he wished to have a kettle. Being informed we had
                  already disposed with every kettle we could possibly spare, Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> gave him his sword, some balls
                  and powder with which he was perfectly satisfied. It was necessary to lay in a
                  stock of provisions, so we entrusted <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> to purchase as many fat dogs as he could. He got ten. The chief
                  loaned us some canoes by which means we swam our horses over the river and hobbled
                  them there. Here was found a <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> woman prisoner, so with <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> to interpret, we conversed with the Wallawallas for several
                  hours. Thus they understood us and the objects of our journey. They had many sick
                  among them and we administered medical aid much to the gratification of these poor
                  wretches. We gave them some eye-water which will render more beneficial service to
                  them than any article we have in our power to bestow. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> put in splints and bandaged the arm of
                  a man who needed care — for the arm was broken and was hanging loose. We
                  camped this night with these friendly people. We played the violin and danced for
                  them. Nine-tenths of them had never seen a white man before, and they seem to have
                  a sincere wish to know us, and be at peace.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Yelleppit">Yellept</name> furnished us with two canoes
                  and we began to transport our baggage across, and to take a party of men over to
                  collect our horses. By 11 a.m. we had all our party and baggage across to the
                  south side of the Columbia. We were detained several hours in collecting the
                  horses. Our guide now informed us it was too late to find a place to camp further
                  on, so we remained on the [Wallula] river. The Indians have traded us two more
                  horses in return for medical aid as dispensed by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> who helped them all he could.</p>

               <p>We have some difficulty in collecting our horses. We purchased two more and
                  several dogs, and exchanged one of our poor horses with our <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> associate for a
                  very good one. We departed at I I a.m. accompanied by our guide and the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> man and his
                  family. We camped on the [Touchet] river where we had the pleasure of an abundance
                  of wood again. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>
                  caught a beaver and an otter. We kept a part of the beaver and gave the balance to
                  the Indians, as they do not eat dog. <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s overtook us with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' horse, as we were obliged to start
                  without finding him this morning. We now have twenty-three horses; some are young,
                  but the greater part have sore backs. The Indians in general are cruel masters;
                  they ride very hard, and their saddles are so poorly constructed as to wound and
                  scarify the poor creatures' backs.</p>

               <p>We sent four hunters ahead and made an early start ourselves. At the distance of
                  nine miles we overtook our hunters who had caught only one beaver. Our Indians
                  differed as to the correct route, but we decided to follow the advice of our
                  guide, and made twenty-three miles decided to follow the advice of our guide, and
                  made twenty-three miles today. Our <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> family left us today. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> killed a deer and we
                  made camp. Soon afterwards, three Wallawallas arrived after a whole day's journey.
                  They brought a steel trap which had been left behind at their vii lage. We can
                  honestly affirm that these Indians are the most hospitable honest and sincere
                  people we have met with on our journey.</p>

               <p>We sent two hunters ahead. We had much difficulty in collecting our horses, but by
                  8 a.m. had gathered all but the one we had obtained from the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> man who had left
                  us yesterday. We had expected this horse would try to regain his companions, and
                  had hobbled him closely, but he broke the thongs. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> engaged one of the Indians who had

                  horse which they had found seventeen miles back. We paid the Indian for his
                  trouble and set forward. In the evening we camped on a [Pilot] creek. The three
                  Indians continued with us. Our hunters caught a beaver and an otter. We set our
                  traps here for there are many signs of beaver.</p>

                  nation and ten of his men. Some of them had descended with us last fall. They had
                  come a considerable distance to meet us. We camped in a small grove of cottonwoods
                  which in some measure broke the violence of the wind which had blown all day,
                  accompanied by snow and hail. Our guide and the three young Wallawallas left
                  abruptly this morning, and we have seen nothing of them since. We divided the last
                  of our dried meat as well as the balance of our dogs, and had a scant supper with
                  nothing left for tomorrow.</p>

               <p>We collected our horses and set out early. We arrived at a village where we
                  purchased two lean dogs and some root-bread of which we made soup. One of our
                  horses fell in the river with his pack consisting principally of ammunition, but
                  fortunately neither horse nor load suffered any injury— the powder being
                  sealed in cannisters. We crossed the [Snake] river, aided by three Indian canoes,
                  and encamped. The chief. Tetoharsky, tells us that Tobey, our former <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name> guide, took two
                  of our best horses away with him when he left us last fall.</p>

                  arrived at the mouth of the [Clearwater] river and proceeded up with an Indian a
                  vial of eye-water for an elegant gray mare—the result of medical attention

                  for they will not give us provisions without compensation; and our stock of trade
                  articles is now reduced to a handful. We take care to give no medicine which can
                  possibly injure them. We went to <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>' [Potlatch] Creek where we had sunk our first canoe last fall
                  when we had descended the river. We camped on this creek at a little distance from
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> village.
                  We had about fifty applicants for medical care, for which we asked dogs and horses
                  in return.</p>

               <p>This morning the husband of a sick woman whom <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had treated last evening, brought a
                  young horse which we killed and butchered for food. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> was busy for several hours
                  administering eye-water to a crowd of applicants. From this service we obtained a
                  plentiful meal, much to the comfort of our party. Here we met with three men of
                  the [Coeur d' Alene] nation who told <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> of a large river which discharged itself into the Columbia
                  to the north. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> named
                  it "<name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s River" in honor of his
                  worthy friend and fellow traveler, Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. We set out, accompanied by a brother of <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name>, the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> chief. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> directed <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> to lead an unbroken horse which we intend
                  to eat. A quarrel ensued between these men regarding the duty. Near evening the
                  horse broke loose and made his escape, much to the chagrin of the party and the
                  keenness of their appetite. This loss left us supperless in the rain.</p>

               <p>We set out early, guided by the brother of <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name>. We crossed the river, and here an Indian produced a
                  cannister of powder which proved to be the same one which we had buried last fall.
                  We rewarded him with a firesteel for his honesty. We camped near the place where
                  we had built our canoes last October. We saw the tracks of deer, so we determined
                  to remain here until noon tomorrow in order to hunt. The Indians inform us that
                  the snow is deep in the mountains before us, and that we shall not be able to pass
                  them until the next full moon — or about June 1st, or perhaps later. This is
                  unwelcome news to men on horse meat and roots who have visions of buffalo to eat.
                  We were accompanied by two Indians, one of whom can speak the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> language. We will
                  therefore be able to converse with them through <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>.</p>

               <p>Most of the hunters turned out at daylight, but a few others remained in camp. We
                  chide these for their indolence and inattention to orders. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> returned at 8 a.m. with a small deer on
                  which we breakfasted, and at 11 a.m. all the hunters returned. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and Cruzatte each brought a deer.
                     <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> had wounded another
                  which <name type="person" key="Seaman">Scannon</name>, Lewis' dog, caught at a
                  little distance from camp. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> caught several trout with a trap. <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name>'s brother gave us a sketch of the
                  principal water courses west of the Rocky Mountains. At 3 p.m. we departed for the
                  lodge of <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name>. We were
                  received coolly by <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name>
                  which was unaccountable to us. The chiefs argued some twenty minutes, so to
                  relieve our horses of their burdens, we went to the first water and made camp. We
                  had been informed that the natives had discovered the deposit of our saddles and
                  had taken them, and that our former herd of horses were now widely scattered.
                  About an hour after we camped, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> returned from hunting, so we sent him to <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> to make inquiries, and to invite him to
                  smoke with us. It developed that there had been some misunderstanding between
                     <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> and <name type="person" key="Broken Arm">Broken Arm</name>, another chief, but we would

                  out and at six miles we arrived at his lodge. <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> set out with two young men, along with
                     <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Alexander Willard</name>, in
                  search of our horses. Late in the evening they returned and brought about half of
                  our saddles and some powder and lead that had been buried. At the same time the
                  young men brought back twentyone of our horses. The greater part were in fine
                  order, but five had been ridden hard last winter and were quite injured. Three
                  others had sore backs. We had them caught and hobbled. Chief <name type="person" key="Broken Arm">Broken Arm</name> lodged with <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> and have become good friends again.</p>

               <p>It snowed this morning, but we collected our horses and set off. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> turned off to hunt and
                  did not return this evening. At 4 p.m. we arrived at a village and <name type="person" key="Broken Arm">Broken Arm</name>, its chief, showed us a place
                  on the bank of a creek where we should camp. We stated our situation in regard to
                  provisions, and the natives gave us some dried salmon and root bread. We told them
                  our men were not used to living on roots for they made them sick. We proposed
                  exchanging one of our poor horses for a young, fat one. The chief told us that
                  they had an abundance of young horses, and that if we wished to eat them, we would
                  be furnished with as many as we wanted. Accordingly, they soon produced two, one
                  of which we killed—saving the other for later. This was the greatest act of
                  hospitality we have witnessed from any nation. We smoked with our Indian friends
                  and gave the chiefs medals. The chief had a large leather tent erected for the
                  captains and invited them to make it their home for so long as we remain with
                  them. As these people have been so liberal, we ordered our men not to crowd the
                  natives' lodges in search for food, as hunger has compelled them to do at some
                  lodges we have passed. We invited the principal men to the tent and spent the
                  evening in explaining who we were, where we wanted to go, the objects of this
                  journey and answering their inquiries. After this council, the Indians stayed with
                  us all night. Our men played the fiddle and danced for them.</p>

               <p>The captains' tent was crowded with sleeping Indians, including all the principal
                  chiefs of this nation. As some of them had been out hunting when we were here last
                  fall, we had missed meeting them before. We explained our country; drew a map, and
                  through our interpreters, made ourselves understood, though the translations had
                  to pass through French, Minnitaree, <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> and the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name> languages. This was tedious, and took
                  half a day, but they were highly pleased. We showed them the spy-glass, compass,
                  watch, air-gun and other articles which proved novel to them. A young man
                  presented us with a fine mare and colt. He said our words had opened his ears and
                  had made his heart glad. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> arrived at 3 p.m. with two deer. Many of the natives apply
                  for medical aid which we give cheerfully as far as our skill and medicines will
                  permit. <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> brought us six
                  horses from our herd. They were in fine order.</p>

               <p>This morning a great number of Indians collected before Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> who is their favorite physician. He began to
                  administer to at least fifty applicants. The chiefs held a council among
                  themselves in regard to what we had told them yesterday. After haranguing the
                  village, they came to us, and two of their men presented <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> with a fine horse. It was agreed
                  that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> would attend the
                  sick while <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> would
                  hear the answer of the chiefs. They said our words were good regarding peace among
                  the tribes, and they would try to follow it. We gave a vial of eye-water to <name type="person" key="Broken Arm">Broken Arm</name> for the use of his people. We
                  gave <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted Hair</name> a gun, a hundred
                  balls and two pounds of powder as part payment for caring for our horses this past
                  winter as we had promised. We also promised to give him the same quantity of
                  powder and lead when we receive the balance of our horses. Three more were brought
                  in, which leaves only six missing — as old Tobey and his son each took one
                  of ours when they returned to their <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> nation last fall.</p>
               <p>We informed the Indians of our wish to form a camp at some proper place where we
                  could fish, hunt and graze our horses until the snows on the mountains would
                  permit us to pass. They recommended a place a few miles distant. As we will need
                  guides to take us on the different routes we intend to take from Traveler's Rest
                  [on the Bitterroot], and as <name type="person" key="Twisted Hair">Twisted
                     Hair</name> has several grown sons who are familiar with the different routes,
                  we invited him to move his family and live with us while we remain here. He was
                  grateful with this expression of confidence and promised to do so. <name type="person" key="Cut Nose">Cutnose</name>, the chief, gave <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> a horse, and several
                  of our men swapped horses with the natives for better ones.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> was busy with his
                  patients. At 11 a.m. we collected our sixty horses and set out for the river
                  escorted by a number of natives. We followed [Lawyer's] creek down to an extensive
                  open bottom of the Kooskooske [Clearwater] River and halted at the place appointed
                  to meet the canoe which was to take us across. As the canoe did not arrive until
                  after sunset, we remained here all night.</p>

               <p>We dispatched <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> to hunt. At 10 a.m. we had our
                  baggage and horses across the river. We reloaded after breakfast and went to the
                  place selected for a permanent camp [near present Kamish, Idaho]. This is a very
                  eligible spot near good hunting grounds and excellent pasture. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> killed two bear, and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> and Peter <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name> were sent with him to bring back the meat,
                  which they did this evening. We gave the Indians some of the bear meat, which was
                  a great treat to them. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> returned late and told us he had killed a bear and two cubs. He
                  brought some large pheasants. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George
                     Shannon</name> also returned with a few pheasants. Our seven stallions are so
                  troublesome that we tried unsuccessfully to exchange them. Therefore, assisted by
                  a native, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> began to
                  castrate them.</p>

                  the three bears <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>
                  had killed. <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name>, Joseph Fields

                  are afflicted with the colic which we attribute to the diet of roots. We had all
                  our horses driven together near our camp so that they can get accustomed to each
                  other. We intend to do this each day. Our party made more comfortable quarters of
                  willow poles and grass, so they are secure from sun and rain. The captains sleep
                  under an old sail, and have a bower to do their writing under.</p>

                  — each killing one. As these bears are very ferocious, we have directed that

                  ridden so that no one of them is injured by being constantly used on the hunt. We
                  directed that the hunters be sent in different directions and not to return until

                  suggested that we try an Indian sweat-bath. Shields sank a circular hole four feet
                  deep and three feet in diameter and built a large fire in it as a sweat-bath for
                     <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>. The fire was
                  taken out, a seat placed inside, and the hole was covered with hoops of willow
                  branches. Blankets were secured over the hoops on all sides. He was given a vessel
                  of water to sprinkle on the hot walls and bottom to create steam. After twenty
                  minutes, he was plunged twice in cold water, and then returned to the hole for
                  three quarters of an hour longer. Afterwards he was taken out and covered with
                  blankets so that he might cool off grad- ually. While in the hole he drank
                  copiously of strong horse-mint tea. We continue to burn out the canoe. Most of the
                  men went to the village and brought back a considerable supply of roots. The

               <p>We were visited by the lame Indian chief whom we had treated previously. He had
                  lost the use of his limbs, so we suggested a sweat-bath in the same manner as

                  showed him the horse-mint plant we had used for tea. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> and Cruzatte hunted towards the

                  make a second attempt. The hole was enlarged so that the man's father could
                  sustain him in the proper position while in the sweat-house. We could not make him
                  sweat as co- piously as we wished. Afterwards he complained of pain and we gave
                  him thirty drops of laudanum which composed him and he rested well.</p>

                  the use of his arms and hands. He washed his face today which he has been unable
                  to do for himself for the past twelve months. Our horses are so wild that we need
                  half of the Indians to help catch them. They are dexterous at throwing a rope and
                  taking the horse with a loop about the neck. As we cannot always depend on the
                  natives, we had a strong compound built in order to take them at our pleasure.</p>
               <p>With Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s party, <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> obtained two Spanish mill

                  other Indians who live near the Spanish country to the south. Towards eve- ning
                  they arrived on the [Snake] river and were entertained at a native fishery.</p>

                  clothing is serious, for there are only three men in the whole party who have more
                  than a blanket apiece. We sent Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and a party to raise the canoe, but

                  new fund by cutting off the buttons from our clothes and by preparing eye- water.
                  We put the eye-water in phials and small tin boxes which had once contained

                  brought in a deer and eight duck eggs by 10 a.m. The other hunters, except <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, returned early
                  without having killed anything. We packed all our articles and made ready for a
                  forced march to Traveler's Rest. We are apprehensive that the snow and want of
                  food for the horses will prove embarrassing to us on our four days journey across
                  the mountains. Everyone is anxious to be in motion to reach the United States.</p>

               <p>Our sixty-five horses were scattered, and so we did not set off until t0 a.m. We
                  went to the prairie where <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben
                     Field</name>s and Alex Wil- lard had been hunting. We found two deer hung up in
                  a tree, and at two and one-half miles further we found our hunters. They had
                  killed another deer. We halted, dined and grazed our horses. We then set out and
                  later camped in a glade with plenty of grass which was near the place where we had
                  stopped on September 20th, 1805. The rains made the road slippery and rendered our
                  progress slow and difficult.</p>

               <p>We set out early and ascended a very steep hill, and soon found ourselves
                  enveloped in snow from twelve to fifteen feet deep. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, our principal woodsman and guide,
                  was doubtful if we could go on without severe loss to our animals. We came to the
                  resolution to return to lower levels where there is hunting and plenty of grass.
                  We made a deposit of all our baggage which we did not immediately need, also the
                  roots, except an allow- ance for a few days. We left our instruments, papers,
                  etc., believing them safer here than to risk them on horseback down over the roads
                  and creeks which we would have to pass. We returned to Hungry Creek. The party was
                  quite dejected by this, our first retrograde march.</p>

               <p>We had difficulty in collecting our horses as they were scattered in the timbered
                  mountain sides where they were searching for food. By 9 a.m. we had collected all
                  but <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>'s and two of
                  Shields. We set out leaving Shields and <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">La Page</name> to collect the lost horses and
                  follow us. We dispatched <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>
                  to the <name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Chopunnish</name>
                  village to secure a guide and hasten the arrival of the Indians who promised to
                  accompany us. We sent a rifle as a reward to any who would conduct us to
                  Traveler's Rest on the [Bitterroot] river. <name type="person" key="Potts, John">John Potts</name> cut his leg badly with a big knife as he was cutting out the

                  the veins to stop the blood. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>'s horse fell, and both of them rolled over each other down the
                  rocks. He lost his blanket, but retained the rest of his gear. We returned to the
                  glade where we dined on the 16th. The Fields brothers went hunting with
                  instructions to join us tomorrow on Collin's Creek. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> fixed a gig in order to catch salmon-trout.</p>

                  so as to make an early start in the morning. We have an abundance of strawberries

                  and the Indians—who had tired of waiting. Reuben and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> had killed a small deer which they
                  gave to the Indians, and had gone on to Hungry Creek in order to hunt for us. The

               <p>We set out early, but one of the guides claimed to be sick—generally the
                  prelude to abandoning an enterprize. We left them, and they promised to overtake
                  us. At 1 a.m. we arrived at the branch of Hungry Creek where we found the Fields
                  brothers. We dined, and the guides came up. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> gave the sick Indian a buffalo

               <p>We set out at 6 a.m. and reached our deposit of goods left on the top of the snowy
                  mountain. It was found untouched. We breakfasted and then reloaded our goods. We
                  set off and ascended and descended sev- eral lofty heights, but kept to the
                  dividing ridge. Late in the evening we reached a fine spring with an abundance of
                  good grass for the horses. One of our guides lost two of his horses, but found
                  them, and rejoined us a little after dark. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> is tormented with a violent headache.

               <p>We started out early and continued along the dividing ridge for nine miles to our
                  camp of September 17th, last year. We are surrounded by tremendous mountains
                  covered with snow as far as the eye can reach. We continued our march, ascending
                  and descending steep mountains to a place where we camped which had a little
                  grass. We have traveled twenty-eight miles without relieving the horses of their
                  packs, nor they having had much food. Our meat being gone, we issued a pint of
                  bear's oil to each mess, which the men mixed with their boiled roots. John Pott's
                  leg is better and gives him little pain.</p>

               <p>We collected our horses which look gaunt this morning. We went along the ridge,
                  our guide being extremely sagacious in finding the old summer trail. About 11 a.m.
                  we arrived at an untimbered side of a moun- tain where we found the abundance of
                  grass the guide had promised. As it was a long way to the next grass, we
                  determined to remain here all night. We melted snow for the water we need.</p>

                     <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s to go to the warm
                  [Lolo] springs ahead to hunt, then we set out early. We were on the heights for
                  five miles, then descended to Glade Creek and bid adieu to the snow. Near the
                  creek we found a deer which our hunters had left for us. This was a fortunate
                  find, for our bear's oil was exhausted and we were reduced to roots without salt.
                  At noon we halted to graze the horses. After we had started on again, we found
                  that we had left one of our pack horses and one of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' riding horses behind. We sent <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> and John <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> back in search of them. We
                  continued on to Lolo springs where we arrived in the early evening. We then sent
                  out several hunters. All, except <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben
                     Field</name>s, returned unsuccessful. Late in the evening <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> arrived with the lost horses — and brought a deer.
                  At these springs the Indians have prepared a bath by stopping the warm stream with
                  stones and gravel. The men took a warm and refreshing bath.</p>

                  down Lolo Creek and nooned at the same spot we had on September 12th last year.
                  While here, Shields killed a deer. In descend- ing the steep side of a hill, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' horse slipped and the
                  captain fell off backwards. Both horse and man slid forty feet down the hill, but
                  for- tunately both were unhurt. After dinner, Shields walked down and killed
                  another deer, and we picked up three others which <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> had killed — making six taken
                  today. A little before sunset we arrived at our old encamp- ment of Traveler's
                  Rest on the south side of Lolo Creek a little above its entrance with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s [Bitterroot] River. We intend
                  to remain here two days to rest our horses and ourselves, and make the final
                  arrangements for dividing our party. Our horses have stood the hard journey
                  surprisingly well and need only a few days rest to restore them perfectly.</p>

                  as far north as latitude 50°. They are then to return and rejoin the canoe
                  party at the mouth of Maria's River.</p>
               <p>The balance of the men are to proceed with <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> to the fork of the Beaverhead River to

                  build a canoe and descend the Yellowstone to its junction with the Mis- souri,

               <p>These arrangements being made, the party was informed, and they pre- pared
                  themselves accordingly. Our hunters meanwhile had killed thirteen deer in fine
                  order. We had the venison sliced and exposed on poles to the sun to dry. As <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name> had burst his gun near its
                  muzzle a few days since, Shields had cut the end off. Now in good order, this was
                  exchanged with the Indian guide for the one he had been given. The Indian was much
                  pleased with the exchange for the gun shoots very well. The guides express the
                  wish to return to their nation, but have agreed to accompany <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> to the Falls of the Missouri.</p>

                  divided among the various parties so as to provide provisions for them. We gave
                  the second gun and some powder and balls to our guides agreeable to our promise.
                  We have dried the greater part of the venison, as we do not expect to find much
                  game on our march. Every man has filled his powder horn, and they have a
                  sufficiency of ammunition for any event. The Indians and our men amused themselves
                  by running foot and horse races.</p>

                  now leave us, they having pointed out the way. We set out, and after five miles we
                  entered the mountains through a narrow pass and came to the [Blackfoot] river
                  where we camped at evening.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> dispatched three

                  and set out. We proceeded up the valley. The hunters joined us with two deer. At
                  noon we dined on a fat saddle of venison and roots in celebration of this July
                  4th. In crossing several creeks our goods got wet. We came to the road we had
                  passed down last fall, and camped on the west fork [<name type="native_nation" key="Nez Perce Indians">Nez Perce</name>] of the river. Two men went out to

                  drying our goods, we left at 4:30 p.m., and crossed the mountains into a valley
                  where we overtook Shields. He had found a good road which will shorten the

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s horses were

                  buffalo. Shields killed a hare. <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> informed us she had been in this country before, and that we

                  As we were descending, a violent storm came up, and we formed a solid column to
                  protect us as best we could. After the storm passed, we went on to a small creek
                  where there was timber. We camped and made a large fire to dry ourselves.</p>

                  worried <name type="person" key="Seaman">Scannon</name> very much. We passed the
                  dividing ridge of a pass [Lewis &amp; <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s Pass]. We then followed down a creek where we camped for the
                  night. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> caught two
                  beaver and shot a third which bit his knee very badly.</p>

                  but nine. Six men were sent to look for them. They went a great distance but
                  returned by 10 a.m., saying they could not be found. They thought that the Indians
                  may have stolen them during the night, as the very best horses were missing. Sgt.

                  a rich, open valley, and arrived at a boiling spring. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> each put a piece of meat in the boiling
                  springs to cook. After letting the horses graze for an hour, we went on and later
                  camped at some beautiful springs which fall into <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>'s [Grasshopper] Creek. We set a
                  sentinel and hobbled the horses. Meanwhile, <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and his party found the nine horses traveling on an Indian road.
                  They turned them back and camped at our last night's camp after carefully hobbling

                  and meat for the three men who are to be left at the caches near the Falls of the
                  Missouri. Reuben Fields killed a buck and an antelope, and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> saw two buffalo at some distance. We
                  are rejoiced at finding ourselves on the plains of the Missouri which abound in
                  game. We camped near a large island where <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> killed a large white wolf.</p>

                  creek, and then headed for <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name> Cove near the two forks of the Beaverhead River. When we
                  reached there in the evening, the tobacco chewers with the party could hardly take
                  time to unpack their horses before they were off to the cache. Upon opening them,
                  we found every article safe. We gave the tobacco users about two feet of a roll,
                  saving some to send down to the men with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' party. The canoes were all safe

                  horses. At noon both parties came together. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> felt the canoes could now come as fast as the
                  horses, for the river is now wider and deeper. Therefore, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> determined to put all the baggage in
                  the canoes, and go himself in a canoe to the Three Forks. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and six of the men were to bring down
                  the horses, and if possible, to camp with us every night. After dinner we all set
                  out and arrived at the same camp where we had been on August 11th, last year.

                  down the Medicine River to hunt elk, and then proceeded with the balance of the
                  party to the White Bear Islands on the Missouri. The buffalo are mating and are
                  keeping up a continual roar. Some of our horses were not acquainted with the
                  buffalo, and are much alarmed with them. We joined the hunters, and they are to
                  kill a supply of buffalo for the men who are to be left at this place. The hunters
                  killed eleven, and we brought in a large quantity of meat. We needed the hides to
                  build some bull-boats, and for gear and shelter. We intend to rest our horses
                  before setting out for the Maria's River journey.</p>

At 8
                  a.m. we overtook one canoe with a deer which <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> had killed. At noon we passed Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>'s horse party near a
                  point of rock called the Beaver's Head. The wind came up, which made our progress
                  slow. At 7 p.m. we camped at the entrance of the Wisdom River. Here we found a
                  bayonet and a canoe we had left here last year. We were joined by <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> who had been sent ahead to hunt.</p>

                  the bull-boats by 10 a.m. At this time two of the men who had been sent for the
                  horses returned with only seven of them. The remaining ten of the best horses were
                  not to be found. Two men were sent on horseback to search for them. At noon, <name type="person" key="Werner, William">Werner</name> returned with three. Sgt.

                  stayed out all night. Meanwhile we transported our baggage to the opposite side of
                  the Missouri in our bull boats which we found answered better than we had
                  expected. We swam our horses over, and camped at sunset.</p>

                  party had passed on down. The wind arose and it was difficult to keep the canoes

                  of plant specimens. The papers and charts of the Missouri fortunately ecaped

                  wheels dug up for the portage, and we found them in good order. The frame of the

                  the sun to dry, and the roots were pounded into meal for <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' proposed journey. The old cache was
                  too damp to deposit <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.

                  for his safe return that we have given little thought to the lost seven horses. We

                  ventured down, recovered his horse, and returned to camp. These bears are so

                  After a delay to give the horses time to feed, and allowing ourselves time to cook
                  and eat dinner, we proceeded down the Yellowstone on a buffalo road. At Shield's

                  The horses' feet are sore, but they are otherwise sound and in good spirits. We
                  can find no timber sufficiently large for a canoe which will carry more than three
                  men. Such a small one would not serve our purpose.</p>

                  a.m. Soon afterwards, we saw a buffalo and killed it. We saved the flesh and made
                  pads of the skin to put on our horses' sore feet. We went on, and after dinner
                     <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> joined us. The
                  current of the Yellowstone is too rapid for skin-boats, and we cannot find trees

                  plains. At 5 p.m. they arrived at the [<name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>] river where he, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields brothers camped. Here
                  they found a wounded buffalo which indicated that Indians were about. The three
                  men reconnoitered for Indian sign, but could make no discovery of them. They
                  brought in two beaver and a deer.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his party
                  continued by horseback down the Yellowstone, looking enroute for large trees to
                  build a canoe. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> killed a
                  deer. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> went on with the
                  canoe party. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> skinned the two mountain sheep
                  and saved the hides and bones so they could be taken back to the States. A high
                  wind detained us which gave Cruzatte the opportunity to kill two big-horn sheep
                  — and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> a deer. Towards
                  evening the wind abated, so we passed down over the rapids with safety, and then
                  encamped.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and his party waited at

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> continued his route
                  north over open plains filled with buffalo and game. At 6 p.m. they reached the
                  Maria's River above the highest point that had been explored in June of last year.
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> directed <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, who was with him on
                  the previous exploration, and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph
                     Fields</name> to drop down to the point of the former highest ascent, to see if
                  any important streams flow into Maria's River between there and here. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s meanwhile kept a strict
                  lookout over the horses and camp.</p>
               <p>At <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s camp on the
                  Yellowstone, Charbonneau was thrown from his horse and was bruised. Enroute, we
                  found quantities of ripe currants of excellent flavor. We saw a smoke signal which
                  we think was raised by the [Crow] Indians. We dined on a buck which Shields had
                  killed. After allowing the horses to feed, we set out at 4 p.m., and afterwards
                  camped on an island. Shields killed a buffalo. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>, in attempting to mount his horse, fell and
                  ran a snag into his thigh. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.

               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s canoe party proceeded
                  on with the gentle current. About noon, <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> killed three deer. We camped a little below a [Smith's] river.
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> from the upper portage,
                  went with three men to the lower end to examine the pirogue and cache left there.
                  Everything was safe, and they took some tobacco from the cache, then covered it
                  over again and returned to the upper portage camp.</p>

                  and they went as far as the party had ascended the previous year, and then
                  returned at noon. They killed eight deer and two antelope enroute. After dinner,
                  the party went twenty miles up the river and camped.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> rose early and dressed
                     <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s wound. We concluded
                  not to take <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> in a litter,
                  for he found he was as comfortable on a gentle horse as he was lying down. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> was directed to follow
                  the river and search for a large tree, and also to hunt for wild ginger to make a
                  poultice for <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s wound. He
                  joined us at dinner with neither, but brought two fat bucks. After dinner we went
                  on, but <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s thigh became so
                  painful he could no longer sit on a horse after two and one-half hours riding.
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> with another man
                  waited with <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> under the shade

                  where there were the largest trees, and <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> brought <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> to the camp selected. Charbonneau reported
                  he had seen Indians on the highlands. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s canoe party continued on while his hunters killed four buffalo
                  and a deer. They halted to take the meat aboard, then went on. At 3 p.m. they
                  arrived at the White Bear Island camp where they found Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and his five men. The whole party hauled the

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> continued up the

               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> sent <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and Shields — both
                  good judges of timber — to go down the river to see if any larger trees
                  could be found — and to return by noon. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>, Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Hall, Hugh">Hugh Hall</name> were sent to bring the skin and
                  flesh of the elk <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>
                  had killed the evening before. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and Shields returned and informed us that there were no better

                     Clark</name> then decided to have two canoes made. We have three axes, so the
                  men set about to fell trees. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> dressed some skins t0 make himself some clothes. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s wound looks better. We shall
                  let the horses rest a few days, after which Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name> will take them overland to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> nation. The men are
                  dressing skins to make clothes, for they are nearly naked. Shields killed a deer,
                     <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> a buffalo, and <name type="person" key="York">York</name> an elk. We dried most of the buffalo meat.

                  the tongues in the wagons. Some of the men are dressing skins. Towards evening, we
                  harnessed the horses to the wagons and found that they would drag them along. We
                  are tormented with mosquitoes which abound here.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> set out early and
                  proceeded up the Maria's River. The horses' feet are sore and travel is therefore
                  slow. This afternoon they traveled up the northern [Cut Bank] branch, and
                  determined to pursue it to its most northern point. At evening they camped under a
                  cliff. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s party
                  discovered that 'twenty-four, or half of the horses were missing. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and Charbonneau were sent to hunt
                  them. Though they searched both up and down the river, they returned unsuccessful.
                  The men are at work on the canoes and one is nearly finished. <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s wound is beginning to heal. We are

               <p>The <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>-<name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> party also had trouble with their horses
                  — they lost all of theirs today. We got two canoes started on the portage
                  along with considerable baggage. We use buffalo dung as a smudge to try to ward
                  off the troublesome mosquitoes and flies. We lay with the canoes all night.</p>

                  the Cut Bank fork and continued for twenty-four miles. They nooned to let the
                  horses rest and graze. They then went 12 miles further where a clump of cottonwood
                  trees were found and camped. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> made celestial observations to determine this northern spot. The
                  base of the Rocky Mountains can be seen about ten miles to the south-west. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> therefore determined
                  it was unnecessary to proceed further north. They wounded a buffalo this evening
                  but the horses were too worn to pursue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> sent Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> and Charbonneau in
                  search of the horses and they returned at 3 p.m., having seen neither horses nor
                  tracks of them. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>,
                     <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, Charbonneau and <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> then circled the camp at
                  some distance around in search of tracks. As the plains are hard and dry, no
                  tracks could be found. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name>, an excellent tracker, is to search tomorrow to find what route
                  the horses had taken.</p>
               <p> Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> sent out a search party
                  of eight men to look for his four missing horses. Two were found down near the
                  Great Falls. We hitched these up to two canoes and went about five miles when a
                  axle-tree broke. We made another, and started out with the two other canoes, and
                  then made camp. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and five
                  men came up late from hunting the two missing horses. They had three buffalo and

                  bearings of the river. They returned and reported that there was no game in this
                  area. They also reported that they had seen an Indian camp recently abandoned, and
                  suspect there are Indians somewhere on the main branch of the Maria's which they

                  and <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name> went out early to

                  moccasin and a small piece of robe which had the appearance of having been worn
                  only a few hours before. We are satisfied that Indians stole the horses and are
                  lurking about to take the rest. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> informed us that he saw the tracks of the horses leading down
                  the river and judged that they were going very fast. The men finished the canoes,
                  and are now making oars and poles. Shields and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> went after buffalo. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> gave instructions to Sgt.
                     <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, along with a

Shields and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> killed three buffalo,

               <p>The <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>-<name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> party harnessed the horses and set out on the

Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> informed us that when the loose horses

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was detained by
                  continual cloudy weather. He sent <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph
                     Fields</name> to hunt near the Maria's River, while he and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s attempted to make celestial
                  observations. Reuben killed nine pigeons. Late in the evening <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> returned with a buck. We are
                  determined to start back tomorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his party set out
                  in the canoes and proceeded well for three hours. We saw a large herd of buffalo
                  and Shields killed two fat deer. We went on until 4 p.m. when we arrived at a
                  remarkable rock [<name type="person" key="Jean Baptiste">Pomp</name>ey's Pillar].
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> ascended the rock
                  which is two hundred feet high. He inscribed his name and date on the rock. Later,
                  the party continued down the Yellowstone and killed two big-horned sheep which
                  were recovered by some of the men. We camped below the entrance of <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>'s [Bull Mountain] Creek.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s party proceeded on to
                  Portage Creek where camp was made. Here two men were left — one to hunt, and
                  one to cook—while the others returned to Willow Creek to bring down the
                  canoes aided by the horses. <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>
                  had killed a buffalo and a badger. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> was better and helped with the portage. By night time we had four
                  canoes safe at portage Creek.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> said adieu to "Camp
                  Disappointment" as he called it, for the continued rains had made observations
                  nearly impossible. At 9 a.m. they set out and took a southerly route over the open
                  plains. After nooning, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> and the Fields brothers kept to the hills while <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> followed the valley of
                  a creek they were on. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> discovered an assemblege of thirty horses, and with his spy-glass,
                  saw several Indians on an eminence who appeared to he watching <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>. This was an unpleasant sight, and
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> resolved to make
                  the best of a had situation, and approach the Indians in a friendly manner. He
                  calculated their number to be about thirty men. To run would convince them we were
                  enemies. Besides, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>
                  was separated from us, and not being apprised of the Indians, probably would fall
                  as a sacrifice to them if we ran. <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph
                     Fields</name> displayed the flag, and we advanced towards them, having agreed
                  that we expected trouble and that these Indians might attempt to rob us We met,
                  and the Indians asked to smoke with us, but we told them that our man below, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>, had the pipe. One of
                  the Indians, with <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s,
                  went to bring in <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>.
                  It now appeared that there were only eight of them, and as it was getting late,
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> proposed that we
                  all go to the creek and camp, which we did, joining <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s and <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>. During the evening we had much
                  conversation, and we explained why we were here. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> told them that if they would go with
                  us to the Missouri, he would give them ten horses and some tobacco. As we settled
                  down to sleep, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> took
                  the first watch and the Indians went to sleep. At 11:30 p.m. he awakened <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s to take the watch and
                  told him that if any Indians left the camp to awaken us all, for he apprehended
                  that they would attempt to steal our horses. This being done, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> fell into a profound sleep and did
                  not wake until a noise awoke him at daylight.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and party proceeded
                  down the Yellowstone in the canoes and arrived at the mouth of the Big Horn River.
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> walked up this river
                  some seven miles to explore and take measurements after which they returned to
                  camp. Shields meanwhile had killed two buffalo and three elk.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and the canoe party sent
                     <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name> to take the canoes down the rapids to where the
                  pirogue and cache were located. Eight of the men returned to Willow Creek and
                  started to bring down the large canoe over the portage. Cruzatte killed a buffalo.
                  All the canoes were brought down to the end of the portage and we went into camp.
                  We opened the cache and loaded its contents into the white pirogue. Everything was
                  safe and in good condition.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> with <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>, Hall and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, arrived at a creek where
                  there was good grass to graze the horses. Here they remained all night. While
                  asleep, <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> was bitten by
                  a wolf, which also made an attempt to seize <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> was awakened and shot the wolf.</p>

               <p>At <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' camp the
                  Indians arose and crowded around the fire. <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>, who was on post, had laid his gun down near where <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s was sleeping. One of the
                  Indians slipped behind and took the guns of the Fields brothers unperceived, while
                  two others advanced and seized the guns of <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>. <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name> seeing this, and looking for his gun,
                  saw an Indian running away with both his and Reuben's guns. Reuben jumped up and
                  both ran after the Indian and overtook him. As they wrested for the guns, <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s stabbed the Indian
                  through the heart. The Indian ran a few steps and then dropped dead. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> recovered his gun and
                  the noise awakened <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>,
                  who finding his gun gone, drew his pistol on the Indian running away with it. The
                  Fields brothers came up and were taking aim to fire to shoot the running Indian.
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> ordered them not
                  to fire. By now, the other In- dians were attempting to drive off the horses. Our
                  three men followed so closely that the Indians left twelve of their own horses,
                  but continued to drive off one of our own. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> called out that he would shoot, and
                  as he raised his gun, one of the Indians jumped behind a rock and spoke to
                  another. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> shot him
                  in the belly. He fell, but raised himself enough to fire at <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>. Not having his shot-pouch, Lewis
                  could not reload, so he retired towards camp. Here he was met by <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> — leaving the
                  Fields brothers to pursue the Indians. They returned with four of their horses
                  — losing only one of our own. As there was no time to be lost, we mounted
                  and took a south-east direction. We pushed our horses as hard as they would go.
                  Fortunately the Indian horses were fresh and very good. After going some
                  sixty-five miles, we halted for an hour and a half to refresh the horses. We then
                  went seventeen miles more, killed a buffalo and stopped for two hours. We then
                  rode on until 2 a.m., and at last laid ourselves down to rest, much fatigued.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> set out early and the
                  party proceeded very well. We passed a creek which we named for <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> [Sarpy Creek]. Our
                  men killed four buffalo and we had breakfast. When we passed the Big Horn River we
                  took our last view of the Rocky Mountains in whose tremendous chains we have been
                  since the 1st of May. At sunset we camped, and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> shot an elk. Shields killed a deer and
                  an antelope which our party needs to make clothes.</p>
               <p>Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s party hauled out the
                  white pirogue and repaired it. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>
                  set out with the horses, loaded with meat, for the mouth of Maria's River. At
                  noon, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>, with <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>, <name type="person" key="McNeal, Hugh">McNeal</name>, <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name>, <name type="person" key="Thompson, John B.">Thompson</name>,

                     <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name> and <name type="person" key="Potts, John">Potts</name> set out with the white pirogue and five canoes.
                  We went on down the rapid water quickly and made a camp on the south side. <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> killed a buffalo. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> camped on the [<name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>] river.</p>
               <p>Up on the Yellowstone, Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> discovered that all of his horses had been stolen during the
                  night by the Indians. He, <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and
                  Hall walked some ten miles without finding them, and then returned to camp. They
                  packed the baggage on their backs and headed for the Yellowstone River which they
                  reached at <name type="person" key="Jean Baptiste">Pomp</name>ey's Pillar, the big
                  rock which <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> had named.
                  Here <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> killed a buffalo and
                  the men proceeded to build a bull-boat from the hide. They decided to make two
                  bullboats in the event an accident should happen and all would be lost if they
                  were in only one.</p>

                  brothers were sore from the long and hard ride yesterday, but they soon resumed
                  riding, for they had reason to believe that the Indians were trying to overtake
                  them. They decided that if they were attacked they would tie the horses together,
                  and they would stand and defend themselves or else sell their lives as dearly as
                  they could. As they neared the Missouri, they heard the reports of rifles, and
                  upon arriving on its banks, they had the unspeakable joy of seeing the canoes with
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>'s party coming down the
                  river. The parties joined, and loaded the baggage that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> had. They threw the saddles in the
                  Missouri and gave the horses a final discharge by setting them free. All embarked
                  in the canoes and proceeded down the river to the principal cache which we
                  proceeded to open. We found it had caved in and much of the contents were injured.
                  The gun-powder, corn flour, pork and salt had sustained little less, but the
                  parched meal was nearly spoiled. Having no time to air the furs and baggage
                  belonging to the men, we loaded them, and slipped down to the point to take on the
                  articles that had been buried in several small caches there. These we found in
                  good order, and recovered everything including the blacksmith's tools, except
                  three traps belonging to <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>. Here Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>
                  joined us with the horses at 1 p.m. We abandoned the horses and all now went by
                  canoes over to the island at the entrance of Maria's River. Here we launched the
                  large red pirogue, but she was so much decayed, and we had no means to fix her. So
                  we took out the nails and other ironwork, and left our old craft here on the upper
                  Missouri. We now re-embarked in the small white pirogue and the five canoes and
                  descended the Missouri about fifteen miles where we camped, surrounded by game.
                  Howard had killed two deer earlier, so <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and the Fields brothers dined well after being on short
                  rations for so long.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and party set out at
                  daylight and glided down the now calm Yellowstone. We passed many creeks and some
                  cliffs that contained strata of coal. We camped on the upper end of a small
                  island. Shields killed two deer and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> killed an antelope for the hides.
                  Beaver are not abundant at this place, but there are many signs of them.</p>

               <p>The party on the Missouri had a bad night as it rained, and they had no shelter.
                  It continued raining all day so we could not dry ourselves nor our baggage. Joseph
                  and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s, <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> took two small canoes to hunt. They are to get
                  as many elk as possible for the hides to cover our canoes and furnish us with
                  shelter. The rest of the party set out early, and as the current is strong, we
                  proceeded rapidly down stream. On our way we killed nine big-horn sheep. We
                  preserved the skeletons of two females and one male. The flesh is extremely tender
                  and well flavored. The Missouri is now so muddy we can hardly drink it. <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> got an elk.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and party set out
                  early but the rain was straight ahead so we made but little way. We camped on an
                  island opposite the mouth of the Tongue River.</p>

                  down the Missouri. The men were anxious to get on, and they rowed with the strong
                  current, so we went at the rate of about seven miles an hour. We got some more
                  big-horn sheep which we prepared to carry to the United States. At evening we
                  arrived at an island about two miles above <name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>'s Island. It rained all day. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> killed a grizzly bear.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s party set out early
                  and at twelve miles arrived at the commencement of some shoals. We had to let the
                  canoes down by hand for fear of them striking the rocks and becoming split. We
                  have come 694 miles, and this is the worst place on the entire route. At twenty
                  miles we passed .a less dangerous rapid, and as a violent storm approached, we

                  some old Indian lodges which, with the elk skins, gave us good shelter from the

                  out as usual, and passed through a mountainous country into a land of extensive
                  plains. Having made sixty-six miles, we camped for the night.</p>

                  spacious lodges. As the rain continued, we stopped here to endeavor to dry the

                  rate. We saw a number of buffalo, elk and bear, but did not detain to take any of
                  them. We overtook the Fields brothers who had killed two large silver-grey bears.

                  <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' party set out
                  early as we wished to arrive at the Burnt Hills — the northernmost bend of
                  the Missouri. We needed to take the altitude of this important location. The men
                  plied the oars and we went on rapidly, but we arrived at twenty minutes after
                  noon, and the sun's meridian was therefore lost. We saw some elk, and <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and Peter Cruzatte
                  went to hunt them. In going through the thick willows by different routes, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was in the act of
                  firing, when a bullet struck him through the left thigh about an inch below his
                  hip joint. The ball missed the bone, but cut across his buttocks into the right
                  thigh. As Capt. Lewis was dressed in brown leather, and Cruzatte could not see
                  well, he had shot <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>,
                  mistaking him for an elk. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.
                     Lewis</name> called to Cruzatte several times, but received no answer, and now
                  supposed he may have been shot by an Indian. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> made his way back to the pirogue. He
                  told the men he was shot by an Indian, and that Cruzatte might have fallen into
                  their hands. The party made preparations for an Indian assault. In this state of
                  suspense, he waited until the men had returned with Cruzatte, and they reported
                  that there were no Indians about. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> did not believe that Cruzatte had shot him intentionally,
                  but that when he did not answer, Cruzatte was anxious to conceal his knowledge of
                  having done so. With the assistance of Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name>, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' clothes were removed, and the wound dressed by putting
                  lint into the bullet holes. The wound is so situated that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> can not move without great pain, and
                  he had to give up the idea of making celestial observations here. Joseph Fields
                  killed an elk, and then we went on — <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> lying in the pirogue. We found a
                  note from <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> stating that
                  he was below and confirming the information that all of the horses had been stolen
                  from Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>. This puts
                  an end to our hopes of obtaining some <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> chiefs to accompany us to the United
                  States.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> delayed on a sand bar
                  to dry the elk meat in the sun. About noon we set out again. At 2 p.m. we observed
                  a canoe, which upon joining us, we found manned by two men from the Illinois -
                     <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Joseph Dickson</name> and Forest
                     <name type="person" key="Hancock, Forrest">Handcock</name>.<ref target="nch2601" n="1"/> They informed us that they were on a trapping expedi-
                  tion to the Yellowstone, and had left the Illinois in the summer of 1804, and had
                  wintered with the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> in 1805 in company of
                  one Coartony or Ceautoin [<name type="person" key="Courtin, Charles">Charles
                     Courtin</name> ?] who had brought goods to trade. The <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> had robbed him of
                  the greater part of his goods, and had wounded <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Dickson</name> in the leg with a hard wad. They informed
                  us that they had met our party under Cpl. Warfington who had on board the keel
                  boat an Arikara chief. They had also met Pierre Dorion, <name type="person" key="McClellan, Robert">Robert McClellan</name> and several other traders on
                  their way up the Missouri. As these were the first white men we had seen since
                  April 13th, 1805, we were anxious for news. However, they went on up the river,
                  and we dropped down a way and then camped.</p>

               <p>The party with <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> set
                  out early, being anxious to overtake <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>. At 8 a.m. we came to the camp of <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Dickson</name> and <name type="person" key="Hancock, Forrest">Handcock</name> who informed us that they had passed
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s party at noon
                  yesterday. We gave them a file and some powder and lead, and a description of the
                  best beaver countries above. We visited for an hour and a half when we were joined
                  by <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">John Collins</name> who had been separated
                  from us since August 3rd. They were well and no accident had occurred, but they
                  were delayed because they thought our party was behind them. We are greatly
                  relieved that they are back with us. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' wounds are stiff and sore. Mr. <name type="person" key="Dickson, Joseph">Dickson</name> and <name type="person" key="Hancock, Forrest">Handcock</name> decided to remain with us, so we all
                  dropped down the river where we found <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and his party. We joined them at 1 p.m., and had the
                  pleasure of finding them all well.</p>
               <p>Meantime, <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> discovered that
                  he had left his tomahawk back at last night's camp. He and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> went back to look for it. The whole party
                  went on to a large bottom to hunt and wait until <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> returned. Shields and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> hunted deer. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name> arrived at 2 p.m., having found the
                  tomahawk. One of the bull-boats got a hole punched in her, which the men patched
                  up successfully. We are all together again which gives us all extreme
                  satisfaction. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> examined
                     <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' wounds and was
                  relieved to think they would be well in twenty days or so. We do not blame
                  Cruzatte, who is near sighted and has the use of but one eye, as he has been an
                  attentive and industrious man in whom we have placed the greatest confidence
                  during our entire journey. At 3 p.m. we proceeded together, having left the
                  bull-boats on the bank as we now have ample canoe space. We camped near
                  Charbonneau's Creek on a large sand point. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> dressed and washed <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' wounds.</p>

               <p>With all hands on board, we set out at sunrise. We passed the entrance of the

                  miles. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> wounded an

               <p>We set out at sunrise. When we were opposite the grand Minnitaree village we saw a
                  number of natives, so we landed. The principal chief and the people are extremely
                  pleased to see us. After a short delay, we proceeded to Black Cat's <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village. We dispatched
                  Charbonneau back to the Minnitaree village with an invitation for them to visit
                  us, and <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> went down
                  to the lower <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> village
                  to ask Mr. Rene <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name> to
                  come up and interpret for us. He arrived, and through him we spoke to the chiefs,
                  inviting some of them to accompany us to the United States. After the council, we
                  crossed to the opposite side of the Missouri to camp in a central position —
                  and a place where we would also be clear of mosquitoes. The chiefs promised us
                  some corn, and Sgt. <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Gass</name> and two
                  men accompanied one to his village. They soon returned loaded with corn, beans and
                  squashes. Several chiefs came over, and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> counciled with them. The chiefs declined to go with us for
                  fear of the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux Indians</name>
                  below. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> fainted

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> again spoke to the
                  chiefs in regard to visiting the United States. They offered a young man of bad
                  character, and in fact, at the time had in his possession <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>'s knife, which he had stolen. We informed
                  the chief of this, and the man delivered up the knife with a meek apology. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> reproached the chiefs for
                  offering such a man to see and hear the words of the Great Father— and they
                  hung their heads in shame. Charbonneau informed us that <name type="person" key="Little Crow">Little Crow</name>, a second chief, wanted to go with us, so
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked to his
                  village to talk with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> expressed the wish to

                  shores of the Yellowstone and Missouri. As this offer was an advantage for <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>, and his services could now be
                  dispensed with, the captains were disposed to be of service to one of our party
                  who had performed his duty as well as <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John
                     Colter</name> had done. We agreed to allow him to go, provided no one else of

                  wished <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> every succcss. We all
                  gave him some powder and lead and several other small articles which would he

                  fall when they had been at. tacked by two parties of Minnitarees and had been
                  completely routed, He also informed us that the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> and the Arikara had nearly come to blows
                  during our absence to the Pacific.</p>

                  <name type="person" key="Colter, John">John Colter</name> left early to go back up
                  the Missouri with his new-found friends. The example of this man shows how easily
                  man can be weaned from the habits of civilized life to the ruder, but scarcely
                  less fascinating life and manners of the woods. <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> had been absent for over two years from the
                  frontiers, and might naturally he presumed to have some anxiety, or some curiosity
                  at least, to return to his friends and country; yet, at the moment when he is
                  approaching the frontiers, he was tempted by a hunting scheme to give up these
                  delightful prospects, and go back without the least reluctance to the solitude of
                  the woods.</p>
               <p>The <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> had offered to
                  give us some corn, and sending Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name> for it, we found they had given us a
                  greater quantity than our canoes could carry. We thanked the chief and took only
                  six loads. We presented the swivel gun to <name type="person" key="Le Borgne">Le
                     Borgne</name>— the one-eyed chief. As it cannot be fired from the small
                  pirogue we now have, and therefore is no longer useful to us, we thought that by
                  this present we might engage this powerful chief to our country's interest. <name type="person" key="Le Borgne">Le Borgne</name> had it conveyed to his village
                  with great pomp. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  walked up to the village and found that "<name type="person" key="Big White">Big
                     White</name>," or Shahaka as he is properly called, had consented to accompany
                  us if we would agree to take his wife and son, and also Mr. Rene <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name> and his two children
                  along. This we were obliged to agree to do. We learned that the fine corn mill we
                  had given these <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> in
                  1804, had been broken up in order for them to procure pieces of iron, and as a

               <p>The principal chiefs of the Minnitaree came to bid us farewell, and as none of
                  them would go with us, Charbonneau, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name> and <name type="person" key="Jean Baptiste">Pomp</name> took
                  their leave of us. We offered to take them with us, but Charbonneau said he had no
                  chance of making a livelihood below, and that he preferred living among the
                  Indians. Charbonneau has been very serviceable to us, and his wife, <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, was particularly useful among
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Shoshone Indians">Shoshoni</name>. Indeed, she
                  has borne the fatigues of a long route, encumbered with an infant, who is now only
                  nineteen months old. We therefore paid Charbonneau wages of $500.33, including the
                  price of a horse and a lodge purchased of him. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> offered to take little <name type="person" key="Jean Baptiste">Pomp</name> but as he had not yet been
                  weaned, his parents observed that one year from now he would be sufficiently old
                  enough to leave his mother, and Charbonneau would then bring him down to <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> to raise and educate. To
                  this <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> agreed [and later
                  did]. We gave Charbonneau the blacksmith's tools and bellows to use among this
                  nation.</p>
               <p>We then dropped down to Shahaka's village to take him and his family aboard. There
                  was much crying by the native women. After smoking the pipe and giving some powder
                  and lead, Shahaka announced that he was ready, and was accompanied to our canoes
                  by all the village. After another council we set out and proceeded as far as our
                  old Fort <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> where we
                  landed. All the buildings except one in the rear had been burned. Only some
                  pickets were standing in front next to the river. We were saddened to see the
                  present condition of our fort where we had spent so many happy hours during the
                  winter of 1804–1805. We then went on to the old Arikara village where we
                  landed.</p>

               <p>The wind caused the river to be so rough we could not depart until 8 a.m. We sent
                  some hunters ahead, and by 2 p.m. we overtook them. They had killed three deer
                  which we divided among our Indians and we cooked dinner on a sand-bar. Shahaka
                  pointed out several places enroute where he said his nation had formerly lived.
                  After dinner we proceeded on and camped a little below the entrance of Heart

                  violence, so we did not set out until 4 p.m. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>' wounds are healing. We came to the
                  hunters who had killed four elk and twelve deer. We loaded most of the flesh and
                  proceeded on to a sand-bar where we camped. <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name> let Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> have a piece of a lodge, and the wives
                  stretched it over some sticks, under which the captains slept dry. The Indians
                  appear satisfied with our party and mode of procedure. We have lashed the small
                  canoes together for safety, but still can make fifty or sixty miles a day in this
                  strong current. The men are all in good spirits.</p>

               <p>We embarked a little after sunrise. At noon we passed the entrance of the
                  Cannonball River. At evening we camped on a sand-bar. We only made eighty-one
                  miles as the water was rough, and the small canoes shipped water which required a
                  man to constantly bail them out. We note a great change in the Missouri —
                  where once were sand-bars, the current now passed — and vice-versa. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> took time to write a

                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> directed Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> to proceed to where there were
                  ash trees growing, and to cut enough to make two oars which we need. Our men put
                  their guns in perfect order as we are now in <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> country. We set out at 5 a.m. and overtook
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> with the ash wood. At 8
                  a.m. we met three Frenchmen coming up the river. They proved to be Francois Rivet,
                  Grenier (Grienyea) and one other man from the Arikara. Two of them, Rivet and
                  Grenier, had wintered with us at the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> in 1804–5. They informed us that they
                  were enroute to the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name>, and intended to return to the Illinois this fall. The other,
                  quite a young lad, who formerly had belonged with the North West Company of
                  traders, wished to return with us. The captains consented, and he was taken aboard
                  in one of the canoes to ply an oar. Rivet and Grenier had neither powder nor lead,
                  so we gave them some. [They probably took <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>'s letter up to Charbonneau.] After a delay of an hour, we parted
                  from them, and we proceeded on. At 11:30 a.m. we arrived in view of the upper
                  Arikara village. We saluted them and the natives were rejoiced to see us, and took
                  us by the hand. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> held a
                  council with the chiefs and again explained the advantages of peace and trade
                  among the nations, and cautioned them to treat the traders well. After smoking,
                  some medals were given, and we parted the best of friends. We dropped down to the
                  first village where <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  repeated the good advice he had given above. After these long conferences where
                  much diplomacy was required, Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> returned to the boats and went to bed. Here a Frenchman, Joseph
                     Garreau,<ref target="nch2703" n="3"/> an interpreter who had lived among the
                  Arikara, and had also done service for the captains in 1804, joined us to go to

               <p>It rained all last night and all our bedding was wet. The interpreter, Mr.
                  Garreau, informed <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> that
                  he had been speaking with the Arikara chiefs, who had assured him that they had no
                  intention of going with us until the chief who had gone down with Cpl. Warfington
                  last year, had been returned. At this nation we found <name type="person" key="Roi, Peter">Rokey</name> [Ross] who had been one of our engages as high as
                  the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> [on the
                  upstream voyage of 1804]. He had spent all his wages, and requested to return with
                  us. We agreed to give him a passage down. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> directed that two guns be fired as a salute, and then we
                  proceeded on, and passed the Grand River and landed to dry our bedding, robes,
                  etc. All were wet and some were spoiled. Five hunters were sent ahead, and at 6
                  p.m. we proceeded to their camp, where we all encamped. They had not killed
                  anything. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> is
                  recovering fast, and walked a little today for the first time.</p>

               <p>We set out early, but at 10 a.m. the wind became so strong that we were obliged to
                  put ashore and wait until 3 p.m. Soon after landing, <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> and the Fields brothers went on down to
                  the next bottom to hunt until our arrival. At 3 p.m. we went on, and landed at the
                  bottom. The hunters had killed three elk and three deer. We went on, and at dark
                  we camped on a sand-bar where the mosquitoes were not so troublesome. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> is recovering —
                  the hole in his buttocks where the bullet passed cut, is closed and is nearly

                  by until 5 p.m. when we went on again. We camped above an old trading post, four
                  miles above our camping place of October 1st, 1804. The <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> have hunted here, so now there is very little

                  to the mouth of the Cheyenne River and made a meridian observation. We sent three
                  hunters to hunt its bottom until noon. They returned with two deer, and at noon we
                  went on. We came to Pania Island and met Shields and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name>. They had killed two deer. We camped below
                  our encampment of September 29, 1804, and here <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a deer. Joseph and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> did not join us this evening which caused

                  <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> attempted to rob us in

                  guard—all arms in perfect order — for we are determined to bear no

                  We sent out hunters as our meat is now exhausted. The hunters returned in three

                  a fat buck which was very timely. At 6 p.m. we heard the bellowing of buffalo. We
                  sent five men to hunt and they returned with two buffalo cows and one bull and a
                  calf. We camped on the lower end of an island. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> took a longer walk than he had the

                  hunt for mule deer and antelope, neither of which we have skins nor skeletons of.
                  They are to go down to the place where we had camped on the 6th and 17th of
                  September 1804. We also sent <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> ahead with the same instructions. At noon we landed at our
                  former campsite and formed a new camp. We sent out Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, Shields, <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">Gibson</name>, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and <name type="person" key="Collins, John">Collins</name> to hunt in the plains up Corvus Creek. We
                  sent <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name> and <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> to hunt for the
                  barking-squirrel, [prairie dog], and all were to kill some magpies if they should
                  set any. Several of the men and the wives of the interpreter. <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name>, and the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> Chief, Shahaka, went to the plum bushes and
                  gathered a large quantity of well flavored plums.</p>
               <p>At 3 p.m. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> returned with a deer

                  species of the animals we were in want of. We procured two barking squirrels.
                  Therefore we directed <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and

                  to proceed slowly in a small canoe down the river to take in anything the hunters

                  get some barking squirrels, but they returned saying none were to be seen. The
                  other men have completed dressing the skins, so we set out at 10 a.m. At noon we

                     <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name>. They got two common

                     Clark</name> directed <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> to hunt on the south-west side of the river. We then
                  proceeded on until we landed on an island. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> and several of the men went in pursuit
                  of buffalo. They killed two bulls, which at this season are very poor. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> ascended an eminence from
                  which he had a view of the plains filled with immense herds of buffalo. After

                  took three hunters and walked ashore. They got two fat elk, which were loaded in
                  the canoes. While we were thus delayed two hours, the men gathered plums and then
                  we proceeded to the place where we are to wait for the Fields brothers and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>. With the aid of the
                  spy-glass, we saw several men on horseback which proved to be Indians. We landed
                  and immediately twenty Indians were discovered on an eminence on the opposite side
                  of the river. Then we saw eighty or ninety Indians come out of the woods about a
                  fourth mile below us. They fired their guns as a salute, which we returned, but
                  were at a loss to determine of what tribe they were. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> took Cruzatte, <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> and <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name>, who could speak <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>, to converse with them.
                  We found they were <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> of the same band that had attempted to rob and detain us in the
                  fall of 1804, and with whom we nearly came to blows. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> told them they had been deaf to our

                  their camp, and not cross to our side of the river, for if they did, we would
                  certainly kill them. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>
                  and the three interpreters returned to our camp and we inspected our arms. The
                  main part of the Indians set out for their camp, but seven of them halted on the
                  top of a hill and yelled insults at us. They told us to come across and they would
                  kill us all, etc., of which we paid no notice. All this time we were extremely
                  anxious for the arrival of <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> and the Fields brothers who were behind. To our great joy they
                  hove in sight at 6 p.m. We then set out and steered towards the shore where the
                  seven Indians were. This move put them in some agitation as to our motives, but we
                  then proceeded on down some six miles where we camped on a large sand bar in the
                  middle of the river. Our hunters killed nine prairie dogs, We put two sentinels on
                  guard. During the night it began to rain, and the wind blew so hard that the
                  cables of two of the canoes broke, and the canoes were blown to the opposite
                  shore. In these boats were Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>, <name type="person" key="Weiser, Peter">Weiser</name>, <name type="person" key="Willard, Alexander">Willard</name> and the Indian party.
                  Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and six men went over to
                  help them return, which was accomplished by 2 a.m. The whole party was
                  re-assembled and we waited in the rain for daylight.</p>

               <p>We examined our arms and proceeded with a wind in our favor. The men rowed hard
                  all day and we did not take time out to cook. At different times we saw several
                  Indians on the hills, but at length lost sight of them. We camped a little below
                  our encampment of September 5, 1804, having come some seventy miles.</p>

               <p>We all set out at the usual hour. Shortly afterwards, <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s, <name type="person" key="Field, Joseph">Joseph Fields</name>, and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name> were landed on an island to hunt
                  deer. We went on past the Niobrara River where we encountered nine Indians who
                  beckoned us to land. We took them to be a war party of the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Tetons</name> and paid no
                  attention to them. As the Fields brothers and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> were behind, we landed on an open,
                  commanding position out of sight of the Indians to wait until our men came up.
                  About fifteen minutes later, several guns were fired by the Indians, which we
                  feared were at our men behind. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> called out fifteen men who ran up to cover them if possible, let
                  the number of Indians be what they might. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> hobbled up the bank and formed the
                  remainder of the men in a defensive position. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>'s party proceeded some 250 yards when
                  we saw the canoe with our men in the distance — and the Indians were where
                  we had left them. The Indians informed us they were <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yanktons</name> and one of our Frenchmen knew one
                  of them to be the brother of young Pierre Dorion's wife. We then invited them to
                  the canoes to smoke. We asked if any of their chiefs had gone down the river with
                  Mr. Dorion, and they answered that their Great Chief and many of their brave men
                  had gone down with him to visit the President. We gave them some ribbons and a
                  bushel of corn. <name type="person" key="Shields, John">John Shields</name> gave
                  them a pair of excellent leggings. The Fields brothers and <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> having joined us, we took leave of this
                  party of <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yanktons</name>.
                  At 2 p.m. we arrived opposite the ancient fortifications, and we set our men to
                  hunt on both sides of the island. <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labiche</name> killed an elk while <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> walked on the shore of the river. At Bonhomme Island we
                  brought two years together on the 1st of September of 1804 and 1806. After we were
                  all together again, we went on down to a large sand bar opposite the bluff where
                  we had previously met the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yanktons</name> in council, and here our old flag-pole was still standing as
                  we had left it two years before.</p>

               <p>We passed the Jacques [James] River at 8 a.m. and later saw the remains of <name type="person" key="McClellan, Robert">Robert McClellan</name>'s house which had
                  been built since we had passed up. The wind came up against us, so we were obliged
                  to lay by here nearly all day. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> went out with eight men to hunt buffalo. They got two in good
                  order, and each man carried as much as he could of the meat back to the canoes. At
                  sunset we proceeded to a sand bar below where we hoped to be free from the
                  mosquitoes which harbor around the wooded banks of the shores. We killed two
                  turkeys which were much admired by the Indians, as they were the first that they
                  had ever seen or tasted. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.

               <p>The wind blew hard last night and the sand sifted over us in a very disagreeable
                  manner. It lulled a little, so we set out; passed the Vermillion River, and at
                  4:30 p.m. we spied two canoes with eighteen men aboard. As we came alongside, we
                  were met by Mr. James Aird, a trader with the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. He received the captains with every mark of
                  friendship. Our first inquiry was after our <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name>, our friends, and the state
                  of the politics of the country. Mr. Aird gave us as much information as he could.
                  Soon after we landed, a violent thunder storm and rain came up, which continued
                  until 10 p.m. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> is
                  well enough to walk with ease. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name> talked with Mr. Aird in his tent until late in the evening, and
                  obtained additional news of our country.</p>

               <p>Mr. Aird generously presented every man of our party with enough tobacco to last
                  us for the rest of our voyage, and insisted upon our accepting a barrel of flour.
                  We found this very agreeable, although we still have a little flour left from our
                  deposit made at the mouth of Maria's River. All we could give in return was about
                  six bushels of corn. At 8 a.m. we set out, and at noon we came to <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Floyd</name>'s Bluff. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name>, Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and several of the men ascended the bluff to
                  the grave of our late Sgt. <name type="person" key="Floyd, Charles">Charles
                     Floyd</name>. We found the grave had been opened by the Indians. We covered it
                  over again, and after paying our last respects, we returned to the canoes. We went
                  on to the sand bar where we had camped from the 12th to the 20th of August 1 804.
                  Here we laid out every article to dry, for all the skins and bedding were wet.
                  Each man was issued a cup of flour. All now being dry, we loaded the canoes for an
                  early departure tomorrow.</p>

               <p>The mosquitoes were so bad last night that the party were already in the canoes,
                  so we set out at daylight. We proceeded on very well, though the river became more
                  narrow and crooked, and is filled with snags and sawyers. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> is still in a convalescent state. We
                  saw no game worth killing — only pelicans, geese, ducks, eagles, etc. We
                  made seventythree miles.</p>

               <p>We set out early, and at the Great-Cut-Off we saw a herd of elk. We landed and
                  sent out several hunters to get some, but they were very wild and ran off, so the
                  hunters returned without killing any. Capt. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> sent two canoes ahead with hunters to search
                  on the bottoms below. After a short delay, we went on and soon met one of the
                  trading boats of Mr. Auguste Chouteau; this one under the charge of Mr. Henry
                  Delauney, with twelve Frenchmen. We purchased a gallon of whiskey from him,
                  promising to pay Mr. Chouteau at St. Louis (which he later would not accept). We
                  gave each man a dram which is the first they have tasted since July 4th, 1805.
                  Several men, including Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name>,
                  exchanged their leather shirts for linen ones, and beaver skins for course hats.
                  At 1 p.m. we set out. They gave us a salute from a swivel they had, which we
                  returned with our rifles. We went on three miles and came to our hunters. They had
                  not killed anything. At five miles more we overtook the canoe of our other hunters
                  with <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name> in it — the
                  two Fields brothers being in the woods behind. We landed on a sand bar and
                  delayed, waiting for the Fields brothers. We sent out three men to hunt. The
                  Fields brothers did not join us, and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> thinks they are below. Our Indians are getting weary of the
                  journey and the children cry, etc.</p>

               <p>We left Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and his canoe
                  and four men to wait for the Fields brothers until noon, and then they are to
                  proceed. We agreed that should we overtake the hunters we would fire a gun which
                  would be a signal to come on. We had proceeded only eight miles by water —
                  though the direct line distance was only about a mile, when we found the hunters
                  and took them on board. We fired the gun as a signal for Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> to proceed. We went to a bottom where we came
                  to — and sent out the hunters. They killed three elk and we sent out some
                  men for the meat on which, with some catfish, we cooked and dined. Sgt. <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Ordway</name> and his men came up, and after
                  taking a sumptuous dinner, we all set out at 4 p.m., and at dusk we encamped on a
                  sand bar about two miles below our encampment of August 4th, 1804.</p>

               <p>We set out very early and at 11 a.m. we came to the Council Bluffs. The captains
                  walked up the bluff to examine the situation and country more particularly as a
                  possible site for a fort or trading post. We then re-embarked, and as the men were
                  anxious to reach the River Platte today, they plied the oars diligently. We made
                  seventy-eight miles when we arrived at our old Catfish Camp where we had stayed on
                  July 22– 24, 1804. This place is twelve miles above the Platte. Enroute,
                  George Gibson killed a deer from his canoe.</p>

               <p>At 8 a.m. we passed the mouth of the River Platte. Late in the evening we arrived
                  at the Bald-pated Prairie and camped opposite our camp of the 16th and 17th of
                  July 1804, having made seventy-three miles today. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> has entirely recovered. His wounds
                  are healed up and he can walk, even run, nearly as well as ever, though the parts

               <p>We set out very early and proceeded on very well. We met Mr. Alexander Lafrost and
                  three Frenchmen who were up from St. Louis to trade on the River Platte. He was
                  very friendly and we accepted a bottle of whiskey for the men. After a delay of a
                  half hour, we went on about three miles, when we met a large pirogue with seven
                  men from St. Louis in charge of Mr. La Croix, enroute to trade with the <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>. We made a few inquiries
                  and then proceeded through a very bad part of the river crowded with snags,
                  sawyers and sand bars. Great caution is required to steer clear of all these
                  obstructions in the present low state of the water. One of our men killed a racoon
                  which is of great interest to our Indians.</p>

               <p>We set out at sunrise and proceeded very well. At 3 p.m. we halted a little above
                  the Nodaway River to kill some game. The six hunters brought in two deer and a
                  turkey. We then went on and camped on an island below the Nodaway. <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> killed a deer.</p>

               <p>We set out at our usual time at sunrise. At about seven miles we met two pirogues
                  from St. Louis. One belonged to Mr. Chouteau, bound for the Platte, while the
                  other was going trapping as high as the <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>. Here we met one of our Frenchmen who had
                  accompanied us in 1804 as high as the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandans</name> [<name type="person" key="Collin, Joseph">Joseph Collin</name> ?]. He informed us that Mr. <name type="person" key="McClellan, Robert">Robert McClellan</name> was a few miles below. We saw a
                  man on shore who was one of Mr. McClellan's party, and we took him on board and
                  proceeded on until we met Mr. McClellan with his twelve men. With him was Mr.
                     <name type="person" key="Gravelines, Joseph">Joseph Gravelines</name> [
                  Gravelein ], the Arikara interpreter, whom we had sent down with an Arikara chief
                  and Cpl. Warfington in the spring of 1805. We examined their instructions and
                  found that Mr. <name type="person" key="Gravelines, Joseph">Gravelines</name> was
                  ordered to the Arikara nation with a speech from the President of the United
                  States to that nation, and some presents which had been given to the Arikara chief
                  who had visited, and unfortunately had died, in Washington. He was also instructed
                  to make every inquiry after the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> party — no intelligence having been received from us for a
                  long time, and they were beginning to be concerned about us. They had heard that
                  we were all killed, and that the Spaniards held us captive in their mines, etc.
                  Mr. Pierre Dorion, Sr., was also present, and had been instructed to accompany Mr.
                     <name type="person" key="Gravelines, Joseph">Gravelines</name>, and through his
                  influence, pass him and his presents through the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Teton">Teton</name>
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name>. Likewise, Mr. Dorion
                  was instructed to make inquiries after us.</p>
               <p> The evening being wet and cloudy, we concluded to lay by all night. Mr.
                  McClellan, whom the captains had known before when he was a scout in Wayne's army
                  in 1794–95, was very polite, and gave us all the news. We sent two canoes
                  with five hunters ahead. Some of the men exchanged robes for shirts, and were
                  treated in the best possible manner by the McClellan party.</p>

               <p>We arose early and Mr. McClellan gave each man a dram, and a little after sunrise
                  we set out. We landed at the camp of the five hunters whom we had sent ahead, but
                  they had killed nothing. As the wind was high and there were many snags below, we
                  concluded to lay by, and sent the small canoes a short distance ahead to hunt.
                     <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> felt unwell and had
                  some chocolate made, which Mr. McClellan had presented to us, after which he found
                  great relief. At 11 a.m. we went on, and came up with the hunters who had killed
                  four deer and a turkey. We delayed here until 5 p.m., when the hunters all joined
                  us, then we proceeded down a few miles and encamped. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name> left his horn, pouch powder and

               <p>We set out early. This is that part of the Missouri where the Kansas Indians
                  resort to robbing the traders passing up the river. They have the custom of
                  examining everything in the pirogues, and taking what they want. It is probable
                  they may want to take these liberties with us. This we will not allow, and at the
                  smallest insult we shall fire on them. At 2 p.m. we met three large boats bound
                  for the <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians, Yankton">Yanktons</name>
                  and the <name type="native_nation" key="Omaha Indians">Omaha</name>; the property
                  of Mr. La Croix, Mr. Aiten and Mr. Chouteau of St. Louis. Their men received us
                  with friendship and pressed on us some whiskey, biscuit, pork and onions. These
                  men are much afraid of meeting with the Kansas Indians. We killed five deer today.
                     <name type="person" key="Gibson, George">George Gibson</name> got one from his
                  canoe. Our party received a dram after we camped, and we sang songs in the
                  greatest harmony until 11 p.m.</p>

               <p>We set out early and, after passing the Kansas River, <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> landed to ascend a hill which appeared
                  to have a commanding situation for a fort. The men gathered pawpaws which are now
                  ripe and we are very fond of them. Joseph and <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">Reuben Field</name>s with <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>, went hunting and brought back a fine, fat
                  elk. We camped a little below Hay Cabin Creek. We notice the heat now, having been
                  for so long in the cooler, northern climate.</p>

               <p>We set out early, but as the day was extremely hot, the men rowed but little. At
                  10 a.m. we met a large trading pirogue bound for the <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Pawnees</name>. We remained a short time with them. At 11
                  a.m. we met young Mr. <name type="person" key="Robidoux, Joseph">Joseph
                     Robidoux</name> with a large boat of six oars and two canoes, and some twenty
                  Frenchmen. We examined his license to trade which appeared doubtful, and the
                  captains cautioned him against degrading the American government in the eyes of
                  the Indians. We camped on an island a little above our encampment of June 16 and
                  17, 1804.</p>

               <p>We set out early as usual. At 11 a.m. we met Capt. John McClallan ascending in a
                  large boat. He had 15 men with him. He was somewhat astonished to see us, and was
                  rejoiced at our return. He informed us that we had long since been given up by the
                  people of the United States, and almost forgotten, though <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name> yet had hopes for us. He
                  gave us some biscuit, chocolate, sugar and whiskey, for which our party was in
                  want. We gave him in return a barrel of corn. He informed us he was going to
                  trade, through the <name type="native_nation" key="Pawnee Indians">Pawnees</name>,
                  with the Spaniards for silver and gold. We sent five hunters ahead to the Grand
                  River where we will meet them tomorrow morning. Last night one of our men [<name type="person" key="Goodrich, Silas">Goodrich</name>?] caught a large catfish
                  which weighed nearly one hundred pounds. We camped with Mr. McClallan and his
                  party.</p>

               <p>We took our leave of Capt. McClallan and proceeded on to the Grand River where we
                  met our five hunters. They had killed nothing. At 10 a.m. we landed to gather
                  pawpaws to eat with our biscuit, as we are entirely out of any other sort of
                  provisions. The men appear perfectly happy, and say they can live on pawpaws if
                  need be. <name type="person" key="Potts, John">John Potts</name> complains of one
                  of his eyes being sunburned. We are constantly exposed to the bright light and
                  reflections from the water and have no cover. <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">George Shannon</name> also complains of sunburn and sore
                  eyes. We camped near the Mine River.</p>

               <p>We set out early and the men plied their oars, so we descended with great
                  velocity. We stopped only once for pawpaws as the party is anxious to reach the
                  settlements. Our party is afflicted with sore eyes. Three of them have eyes so
                  inflamed as to be extremely painful.</p>

               <p> We left adrift the two canoes which had been built high up on the Yellowstone,
                  and divided the men into the other canoes, for some of them are unable to row
                  because of their sore eves. At noon we met a canoe containing five Frenchmen bound
                  for the <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name> nation. We saw
                  some cows on the river bank which was a joyful sight, and the men raised a shout
                  at the pleasure of seeing this image of civilization and domestic life. We came to
                  the little French village of La Charette, where we landed and were very politely
                  received. Every person expressed pleasure at our safe return, and admitted
                  astonishment in seeing us. On our arrival we fired a salute, which was returned by
                  five trading boats moored there. The traders furnished us with beef, flour and
                  pork, which gave us a very agreeable supper. We remained in La Charette overnight.
                  The French residents gave us some milk.</p>

               <p>We collected our men, for several of them had accepted an invitation by the
                  citizens, and had visited their families. At 7:30 a.m. we set out, and after
                  passing several boats, at 4 p.m. we arrived in sight of St. Charles. The party
                  rejoiced at the sight of this hospitable village, and plied their oars with great
                  dexterity, so we were soon opposite the town. This being Sunday, we observed a
                  number of ladies and gentlemen walking along the bank. We saluted the town with
                  three rounds, and landed at the lower part of the town where we were met by a
                  great number of the citizens. We found them extremely polite and they seemed to
                  vie with each other in being generous. Mr. Quirie <ref target="nch2801" n="1"/>
                  undertook to supply our party with provisions. This civility detained us
                  overnight, for most of the party got refreshments and quarters in town.</p>

               <p>As it rained hard all morning, and our party was all sheltered in the houses of
                  these hospitable people, we did not think it proper to proceed until the rain was
                  over. At 10 a.m. it ceased raining, and we collected our party and proceeded on
                  down to Fort Bellefontaine. We were kindly received by Col. Thomas Hunt and Lieut.
                  George Peter of this place, who gave us a salute of seventeen guns and a hearty
                  welcome. Most of our party was quartered in the cantonement over night.</p>

               <p>We rose early and took the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> chief, Shahaka, to the public store to furnish him with some
                  clothes, etc. After breakfast, we descended the Mississippi and landed at River du
                  Bois to view the camp where we had wintered in 1803–1804. Here we found a
                  widow woman <ref target="nch2802" n="2"/> whom we had left here, and who now had a
                  plantation under tolerable way since we have been on our expedition. We delayed a
                  short time and then crossed over the Mississippi, where at about noon we arrived
                  at St. Louis. The party fired their guns as a salute, and we landed opposite the
                  center of the town. We were dressed entirely in buck-skin except for the linen
                  shirts the men had bought from the traders just previously.</p>
               <p>We unloaded the canoes and carried the baggage up to the store rooms of Major
                  William Christy. The party is considerably rejoiced that we have the expedition
                  completed. We looked for boarding in town, and wait for our pay. We then intend to
                  return to our native homes to see our parents and families once more, as we have
                  been so long from them. The captains accepted the invitation of Mr. Pierre
                  Chouteau to stay at his house.</p>

               <p>The captains rose early and commenced to write letters to the President, <name type="person" key="Clark, George Rogers">George Rogers Clark</name>, Gen. Wm.
                  H. Harrison and Charbonneau. We sent the first of these letters by <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> across the river to
                  Cahokia where the post has been detained to receive them. After dinner the
                  captains went to a store to purchase some goods and engage a tailor to make them
                  some clothes.</p>

               <p>While the captains were busy with their reports and letters, the men sunned and
                  dried all of the goods and articles. They were then stored at the warehouse of Mr.
                  Caddy Chouteau. The captains paid some formal visits to the gentlemen of St.
                  Louis, who entertained us in the evening with a dinner and a ball.</p>
               <p>The horns and skeletons of the big-horn sheep, along with the robes, grizzly bear
                  skins, barking squirrels, mule deer skins, Clatsop hats, Indian baskets, etc.,
                  were packed and sent to Washington. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> advised <name type="person" key="Jefferson, Thomas">President Jefferson</name> by letter that the expedition had, in obedience to
                  orders, crossed the continent and had sufficiently explored the interior, to have
                  discovered the navigable headwaters of the Missouri and Columbia rivers by the
                  most practical route. He gave a resume of the trip, but noted that he would soon
                  give a more full report in person. However, he would be necessarily delayed some
                  days to settle with, and discharge the men who had accompanied him on the voyage
                  of discovery. He will bring the <name type="native_nation" key="Mandan Indians">Mandan</name> Chief, Shahaka, and with respect to the exertions and services
                  rendered by his worthy friend, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt.
                     Clark</name>, he cannot say too much. He noted that if any credit be due to the
                  success of the arduous enterprise in which we have been engaged, that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>, equally with himself, is
                  entitled to the consideration of yourself and the country.</p>

            <p>The men were paid off and discharged on October to, 1806, and for most of them it was
               the end of the adventure. They drifted back to their families and friends. Some
               married and settled on farms. Others returned to the mountains in the employ of the
               fur traders who were now anxious to penetrate the newly discovered, rich beaver
               streams on the headwaters of the Missouri and Yellowstone. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name> promptly returned his commission in the

            <p>Unfortunately not much more can be added to the lives of the men who comprised the
               expedition than has been given in the brief biographies in the preceding "Roster."
               The main hope for additional data may be in the discovery of Sgt. <name type="person" key="Pryor, Nathaniel Hale">Pryor</name>'s journal, the <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Robert Frazier</name> journal, and the original manuscript
               journal of <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Patrick Gass</name>. As indicated
               in my roster, there is the promise of further information yet to be discovered by
               genealogical research.</p>
            <p>Among the obscure records of the fur traders there is the report of David <name type="person" key="Thompson, John B.">Thompson</name>
               <ref target="nfinis02" n="2"/> of one <name type="person" key="Courtin, Charles">Charles Courtin</name>, or Courter, a Canadian who had sworn allegiance to the
               United States in order to ascend the Missouri in 1805. In July 1807, Courtin and his
               party of forty-two Americans were in the Columbia River basin among the <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name>. Two of these members
               are stated to have been former members of the Lewis and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> Expedition. They could have been two men of the
               return party of 1805, and perhaps Francois Rivet was one. Phillipe Degie, who was not
               a regular member, could be the other.</p>
            <p>It can easily be imagined that for many of the men the return to civilian life was a
               difficult time of adjustment. After their exciting return they must have been
               acclaimed and feted, and this in itself was a complete change from their former
               woodsman lives, and from the privations they had just come through. Then as today,
               men have had a problem in adjusting to sudden fame and adulation, and not everyone
               can successfully take it in stride. We can understand then, if a few of these men
               fell by the wayside. For most of them however, it was an experience passed, with a
               future to be met. Like hundreds of other citizens about them, they fitted into the
               routine pattern of earning a living, marrying and raising families.</p>

               <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and Mr. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> arrived in Frankfort, Kentucky,

               family and interpreter, Rene <name type="person" key="Jusseaume, René">Jessaume</name>. A party of <name type="native_nation" key="Osage Indians">Osage</name>s also went along. They all went on to Washington, except citizen
               William <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>. He visited his
               brothers in Louisville, and then went on to Virginia to woo <name type="person" key="Hancock, Julia">Julia Hancock</name>. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was not interested in the gala receptions given
               in Washington on January 10 and 14, 1807, in honor of the expedition's triumphant
               return, so <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> attended
               these affairs without his companion, <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William
                  Clark</name>.</p>
            <p>Early in 1807, Lewis was appointed Governor of Upper Louisiana, and <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was appointed Brigadier General of
               the Louisiana Militia. They soon had their hands full of political problems in the
               new Territory. There was the Aaron Burr conspiracy for which ex-member Robert <name type="person" key="Frazer, Robert">Frazier</name> had been uncovering alarming
               evidence of treason, and was a witness at the trial.</p>
            <p>Governor Lewis stepped into a tangled mess. The original French settlers had problems
               with the influx of American settlers. There were uncertainties and confusion with the
               French, Spanish and American land titles. The bitter antagonism of the jealous
               Secretary of the Territory, Frederick Bates, was of no help. The Indians did not like
               the treaties they had signed, the traders did not like any regulation whatever, and
               the British were keeping the fires alive under all. The War Department began to
               protest Capt. Lewis' drafts, and it was more than Governor Lewis could handle. In the
               end he set off for Washington to try to get the matters straightened out.</p>
            <p>On March 9, 1807, the authorization for the land warrants promised by Congress was
               received, and the following men signed a receipt for the bounty:<ref target="nfinis03" n="3"/>

            <p>It may be assumed that these twenty-two men were present in St. Louis at the time.
               The others were scattered over the country and had to sign, or have Governor Lewis
               sign for them, at a later time.</p>
            <p>Eventually the expenses of the expedition were totaled. There was the extra pay, the
               land grants and a hundred other charges added to the costs. It was finally estimated
               at a cost of $38,722.25 which depended on how certain charges were construed as
               actual costs or incidental charges to the expedition. Were the costs of transporting
               and entertaining the Indians in Washington a proper charge to the expedition? So the
               stated figure is as good as any, and certainly not an unreasonable amount for the
               value received.</p>
            <p>Inevitably the scandal mongers had to have their say. They have tried to imply that
               there was a secret romance between <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> and <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, and that
                  <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> left descendants among the
                  <name type="native_nation" key="Flathead Indians">Flatheads</name> and other
               tribes. As to the first charge, there is no question that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> felt sorry for the hard life of <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</name>, and he respected her. So did
               everyone else. He certainly tried to help her children have a better life, but beyond
               that there is no proof of any romance whatsoever. As to the descendants, the men were
               normal and the native women were willing. But why <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> should be singled out as the only parent among
               the whole party can only be because he was now a famous name. Scandal is only of
               interest and is repeated if it can be attached to the names of celebrities.</p>
            <p>It is sometimes inferred that the skirmish which Capt. Lewis had with the <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name> Indians up on the
               Cut Bank River was the cause of the bitter animosity which the <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name> carried on against
               the white traders for so many years that followed. <name type="person" key="Lisa, Manuel">Manuel Lisa</name> later learned from the <name type="native_nation" key="Blackfeet Indians">Blackfoot</name> themselves that they
               felt the actions of their men justified the retribution that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> and his men inflicted upon them, and
               that they got what was to be expected in an unsuccessful raid.</p>
            <p>And then there are those inferences that <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis</name> was the commander while <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was only an adjutant. Of course this is
               technically true, but there is no evidence that the commanders nor any of the men
               ever drew such a distinction. The equality of command is abundantly clear throughout
               the expedition. The remarkable fact is that there never was a recorded occasion,
               during or after the expedition, when the leaders did not work together in complete
               appreciation for each other's abilities. This is the more remarkable for both
               captains were opposites in temperament. Lewis was better schooled but showed several
               instances of shorttempered impulsive actions. <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> was usually firm and unruffled. Though there is
               no intimation of it, Lewis in his wounded and painful condition, must have been
               annoyed when <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> kept dropping down
               the Missouri when it had been agreed that they would rendezvous at the mouth of the
               Yellowstone. Furthermore, the men must have been inclined to turn to the warm and
               friendly <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name>, rather than to the
               more aloof and unapproachable Lewis. These were conditions which normally bring about
               jealousy and dissension, particularly as they saw each other day in and day out for
               over two years. Their loyalty and friendship to each other under all conditions is
               one of the classic friendships in all recorded history.</p>
            <p>The same loyalty is evident among the men. In their journals they are silent, or at
               most, extremely discreet, about mentioning any of the unpleasant things such as
               punishments and dismissals. One can read between the lines and find suggestions of
               cases where the men got on each other's nerves. We are hardly told that <name type="person" key="Robertson, John">John Robertson</name> was dismissed from the
               party, and no reason is given, but it seems clear that he was a trouble maker and did
               not fit in with the other men. He was dismissed — without comment. We learn
               there were a few quarrels such as the one between <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> and <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name> over leading a spare horse. No one tells us what
               really motivated it, for to them it was unimportant. Knowing human nature, these
               things would normally have happened.</p>
            <p>In answer to those who might construe that the captains' friendship and loyalty to
               each other was only a bearing assumed to see the expedition through, and that they
               subdued their inner feelings with a bold front for the sake of example — there
               remains the final test. The expedition was now an accomplished fact and former
               promises could have been conveniently forgotten, particularly as there was so much
               opposition from the War Department against <name type="person" key="Clark, William">William Clark</name>.</p>
            <p>When Secretary of War Dearborn, proposed that the enlisted men should receive 320
               acres of government land as an extra bonus; that <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> should get 1000 acres; while Lewis was to
               receive 1600 acres, Lewis rebelled. To the very end in Lewis' steadfast conviction,
               they had been in equal command and had shared equal responsibilities, and each should
               receive the same reward. To the credit of official Washington it is recorded that
               they got the point, and each leader was awarded the same amount — 1600 acres.
               Yes, both were true to their dying days, and such respect and friendship are rare and
               unique in human relations.</p>
            <p>And this loyalty prevailed among the enlisted men. Loyalty to each other, loyalty to
               their captains and loyalty to their country by opening up a vast new country and in
               bending every effort to bring the expedition's purpose to its successful close. For
               this they should be remembered and honored. A good place to start would be for
               enlightened state governments to restore the original names of the rivers and creeks
               which were named for the members of the expedition.</p>

                  <p>A tantalizing bit of information is contained in a letter to me from Milo M.
                     Quaife, dated Detroit, January 19, 1945, from which I quote in part: "As
                     recently as 1929, a member of the <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> family at <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>, Canada, brought me two letters. One of them was <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>'s last
                     letter written at St. Louis, May 23, 1809, and addressed to his half-sister,
                     Mary Louise, wife of Lambert Parent of Detroit. – When Miss <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> brought me these
                     two letters just noted, I of course proceeded to inquire whether she had any
                     more of the family letters. She answered that some years before her parents had
                     moved from <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name> to
                     Hollywood, California, and had died there. Miss <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name> herself before returning to <name type="person" key="Windsor, Richard">Windsor</name>, had placed the family
                     furniture in storage with some storage company, and it was still in their
                     possession in 1929. Meanwhile, the charges which had accrued upon it had become
                     so large that she was unable to pay them and recover possession of the
                     furniture. The pertinent point in this connection was that she stated there was
                     a box of family papers included among her parents' possessions. Of course I
                     wanted to recover the box but saw no way to do it in view of the circumstances
                     recited. Fifteen years have passed and I have no present knowledge of Miss
                        <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">Drouillard</name>'s
                     where-abouts. It is perhaps a fair supposition that more of <name type="person" key="Drouillard, George">George Drouillard</name>'s letters and family
                     papers were dumped into the rubbish heap by the storage company in Hollywood,
                     at some date subsequent to 1929. Sincerely Yours, M. M. Quaife."</p>
                  <p>I am advised that the storage companies usually auction off such goods held for
                     delinquent payments. There is the remote possibility that some second hand
                     furniture dealer may yet have this box of papers.</p>

                  I received a most informative communication from Mr. Anton J. Pregaldin of
                  Clayton, Missouri, in answer to an earlier request of mine for data regarding the
                  French-Canadian engagee members of the Expedition. Mr. Pregaldin has been
                  researching and compiling the genealogies of the French pioneer families from the
                  Catholic parish registers and other records for many years. He has kindly allowed
                  me to incorporate his material into my biographies of these men. I am most
                  grateful for such data, as it throws more light upon these men, long lost in the
                  darkness of time and neglect. Mr. Pregaldin states: "Research on the voyagers is
                  difficult because many of the Frenchmen on the rivers came from Canada and either
                  returned there after a time, or died in the Indian country. These, of course,
                  would not be likely to leave much trace in the Parish registers." </note>

                        of ancient Canadian stock, who abound on the western frontier, and
                        amalgamate or co-habit with the savages. He had sojourned among various
                        tribes, and perhaps left progeny among them all; but his regular, or
                        habitual wife, was a <name type="native_nation" key="Sioux Indians">Sioux</name> squaw. By her he had a hopeful brood of half-breed sons, of
                        whom, Pierre Jr., was one. The domestic affairs of old Dorion were conducted
                        in the true Indian plan. Father and son would occasionaly get drunk
                        together, and then the cabin was the scene of a ruffian brawl and fighting,
                        in the course of which the old Frenchman was apt to get soundly belabored by
                        his mongrel offspring. Once one of his sons had him on the ground and was
                        about to scalp him. "Hold! my son, you are too brave, too honorable to scalp
                        your father." This appeal touched the French side of the half-breed's heart
                        so he suffered the old man to wear his scalp unharmed.</quote>

                     mountains forever. He settled his family in Sangamon County, Illinois, and died
                     in 1844 at the home of a daughter in Morgan County, Illinois.</p>
