          Side and landed on a Sand bar and Sent out the hunters to kill Some meat, our Stock of
          meat being now exousted and this the most favourable place to precure a fresh Supply,
          the hunters returned in 3 hours without haveing killed any thing. they informed me that
          the bottoms were entirely beaten up and the grass laid flat by the emence number of
          Buffalow which had been here a Short time past.    the deer had left the
          bottom.    they Saw several Buffalow Bulls which they did not think proper to
          kill as they were unfit for use. here we discover the first Signs of the wild turkey.

          timely as our meat was entirely exhosted.    at 2 P. M we again proceeded on
          down saw Several Buffalow Bulls on each Side of the river also Some deer of the Common
          kind.

          round the bend; at the lower end of which we killed an elk. As we were passing an
          island, we saw a gang of buffaloe feeding on it; when we halted and killed three of
          them, and encamped on the island for the night.
