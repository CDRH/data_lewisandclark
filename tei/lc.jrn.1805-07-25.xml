               <p>Set out at an early hour and proceeded on tolerably well the water still strong and
          some riffles as yesterday.    the country continues much the same as the two
          preceeding days.    in the forenoon we saw a large brown bear on an island but
          he retreated immediately to the main shore and ran off before we could get in reach of
          him.    they appear to be more shy here than on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>below the mountains.   
          we saw some antelopes of which we killed one.    these anamals appear now to
          have collected again is small herds several females with their young and one or two
          males compose the herd usually.    some males are yet soletary or two perhaps
          together scattered over the plains which they seen invariably to prefer to the
          woodlands.    if they happen accedentaly in the woodlands and are allarmed
          they run immediately to the plains, seeming to plaise a just confidence in their
          superior fleetness and bottom.    we killed a couple of young gees which are
          very abundant and fine; but as they are but small game to subsist a party on of our
          strength I have forbid the men shooting at them as it waists a considerably quantity of
          amunition and delays our progress.    we passed 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name>encampment of the 23rd
          inst.    the face of the country &amp; anamal and vegatable productions were
          the same as yesterday, untill late in the evening, when the valley appeared to
          termineate and the river was again hemned in on both sides with high caiggy and rocky
          clifts.
          <ref target="n17072501" n="1"/>   soon after entering these hills or low
          mountains we passed a number of fine bold springs which burst out underneath the Lard.
          clifts near the edge of the water; they wer very cold and freestone water.   
          we passed a large Crk. today in the plain country, 25 yds. wide, which discharges itself
          on the Stard. side; it is composed of five streams which unite in the plain at no great
          distance from the river and have their souces in the Mts.    this stream we
          called 
          <name type="place" key="Crow (Gass's) Creek (Mont.)">Gass's Creek</name>.
          <ref target="n17072502" n="2"/>   after 
          <name type="person" key="Gass, Patrick">Sergt. Patric Gass</name>one of our party.—
             two rapids near the large spring we passed this evening were the worst we
          have seen since that we passed on entering the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky Mountain</name>; they were obstructed
          with sharp pointed rocks, ranges of which extended quite across the river.   
          the clifts are formed of a lighter coloured stone than those below    I obseve
          some limestone also in the bed of the river which seem to have been brought down by the
          current as they are generally small and woarn smooth.—
          <ref target="n17072503" n="3"/>   This morning 
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark</name>set out early and at the
          distance of a few miles arrived at the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Three Forks of the">three forks of the
          Missouri</name>,
          <ref target="n17072504" n="4"/>here he found the plains recently birnt on the stard.
          side, and the track of a horse which appeared to have passed only about four or five
          days.    after taking breakfast of some meat which they had brought with them,
          examined the rivers, and written me a note informing me of his intended rout, he
          continued on up 
          <name type="place" key="Jefferson River (North, Southwest Fork)">the North fork</name>,
          which though not larger than the 
          <name type="place" key="Madison River (Middle Fork)">middle fork</name>, boar more to
          the West, and of course more in the direction we were anxious to pursue.    he
          ascended this stream about 25 miles on Stard. side, and encamped,
          <ref target="n17072505" n="5"/>much fatiegued, his feet blistered and wounded with the
          prickley pear thorns. 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>gave out, one of his
          ankles failed him and he was unable to proceede any further.—    I observed
          that the rocks which form the clifts on this part of the river appear as if they had
          been undermined by the river and by their weight had seperated from the parent hill and
          tumbled on their sides, the stratas of rock of which they are composed lying with their
          edges up; others not seperated seem obliquely depressed on the side next the river as if
          they had sunk down to fill the cavity which had been formed by the washing and wearing
          of the river. I have observed a red as well as a yellow species of goosberry
          <ref target="n17072506" n="6"/>which grows on the rocky Clifts in open places of a
          swetish pine like flavor, first observed in the neighbourhood of 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River, Great Falls of the">the falls</name>; at least
          the yellow species was first observed there.    the red differs from it in no
          particular except it's colour and size being somewhat larger; it is a very indifferent
          fruit, but as they form a variety of the native fruits of this country I preserved some
          of their seeds.    musquetoes and knats troublesome as usual.</p>

          rise on the southern shore, about four miles above the entrance of this range. We went

             discovered mountains a head which appear to have Snow on them, if not Snow

          large plains on each Side of the River &amp; looks pleasant and extensive.

          across the River and appear Shallow all the way across.    we double manned
          and got up Safe.    I cut my foot with the Stone a towing along the Shore.
             Saw excelent Springs which ran from under the clifts.    we came

               <p>Thursday July 25th    This morning clear &amp; pleasant, we set out as
          usual, and proceeded on our Voyage, and on an Island saw a large White or brown bear,
          &amp; in the River numbers of Otters, and a flock of Antelopes on the Shore one of which
          our hunters killed.—    We passed by a Camp, where

          discover'd Mountains lying ahead of us, which has the appearance of Snow being on them,
          from their white Colour, we still found abundance of Red &amp; Yellow currants.
             We did not find the Islands or timber so plenty, as it was Yesterday.
             We found large extensive plains lying on both sides of the River, which had
          a pleasant appearance.    In the afternoon we 〈enter'd into〉 passed some rough
          rockey hills, which we expect from the account we have from the Indian Woman that is
          with us, to be the commencement of the Second chain of the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">Rockey Mountains</name>; but they do not
          appear, to be so high, as the first chain of Mountains which we have passed, nor so
          solid a rock at the entrance of them.—    We found several bad rockey Rapids,
          which we had to pass through, and 〈are〉 the Water was so shallow that the Rocks appeared
          above the Water almost across the River, We double manned our Canoes, and with
          difficulty got over them, by hard towing; We saw several excellent springs, which came
          out from under the Clifts of Rocks, near the River, We came 16 Miles this day, &amp;
          encamped on the North side of the River.—</p>
               <p>The men were very much fataigued towing the Canoes this day, and some of them had
