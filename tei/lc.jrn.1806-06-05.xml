                  <name type="person" key="Colter, John">Colter</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Bratton, William E.">Bratton</name>were permitted to visit the
          indian villages today for the purpose of trading for roots and bread, they were
          fortunate and made a good return.    we gave the indian cheif another sweat
          today, continuing it as long as he could possibly bear it; in the evening he was very
          languid but appeared still to improve in the use of his limbs.    the child is
          recovering fast the inflamation has subsided intirely, we discontinued the poltice, and
          applyed a plaster of basilicon; the part is still considerably swolen and hard.
             in the evening 
          <name type="person" key="Field, Reubin">R. Feilds</name>
                  <name type="person" key="Shannon, George">Shannon</name>and 
          <name type="person" key="Labiche, François">Labuish</name>return from the chaise and
          brought with them five deer and a brown bear. among the grasses of this country I
          observe a large speceis
          <ref target="n35060501" n="1"/>which grows in moist situations; it rises to the hight
          of eight or ten feet, the culm is jointed, hollow, smooth, as large as a goos quill and
          more firm than ordinary grasses; the leaf is linnear broad and rough; it has much the
          appearance of the maden cain as it is called in the state of 
          <name type="place" key="Georgia">Gergia</name>, and retains it's virdure untill late in
          the fall.    this grass propegates principally by the root which is horizontal
          and perennial.    a second speceis
          <ref target="n35060502" n="2"/>grows in tussucks and rises to the hight of six or eight
          feet; it seems to delight in the soil of the river bottoms which possess a greater
          mixture of sand than the hills in this neighbourhood.    this is also a harsh
          course grass; it appears to be the same which is called the Corn grass in the Southern
          states, and the foxtail in 
          <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>.    a third speceis
          <ref target="n35060503" n="3"/>resembles the cheet, tho' the horses feed on it very
          freely.    a fourth and most prevalent speceis
          <ref target="n35060504" n="4"/>is a grass which appears to be the same called the blue
          grass common to many parts of the United States; it is common to the bottom as well as
          the uplands, is now seeding and is from 9 inches to 2 feet high; it affords an excellent
          pasture for horses and appears to bear the frosts and snow better than any grass in our
          country; I therefore regret very much that the seed will not be ripe before our probable
          departure.    this is a fine soft grass and would no doubt make excellent hay
          if cultivated. I do not find the greenswoard
          <ref target="n35060505" n="5"/>here which we met with on the lower part of the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>.    there are also
          several speceis of the wild rye
          <ref target="n35060506" n="6"/>to be met with in the praries.    among the
          plants and shrubs common to our contry I observe here the seven bark, wild rose,
          <ref target="n35060507" n="7"/>vining honeysickle, sweet willow, red willow, longleafed
          pine, Cattail or cooper's flag, lamsquarter,
          <ref target="n35060508" n="8"/>strawberry,
          <ref target="n35060509" n="9"/>raspberry,
          <ref target="n35060510" n="10"/>tonge grass,
          <ref target="n35060511" n="11"/>musterd,
          <ref target="n35060512" n="12"/>tanzy,
          <ref target="n35060513" n="13"/>sinquefield, horsemint, coltsfoot,
          <ref target="n35060514" n="14"/>〈horsemint〉 green plantin,

          Indian Village to day for the purpose of tradeing for roots and bread, they were
          fortunate and made a good return.    we gave the Indian Chief another Sweat
          to-day, continuing it as long as he could bear it.    in the evening he was
          very languid but Still to improve in the use of his limbs.    the Child is
          revovereing fast. I applied a plaster of Sarve made of the Rozen of the long leafed
          pine, Beas wax and Beare oil mixed, which has Subsided the inflomation entirely, the
          part is Considerably Swelled and hard—.    in the evening

               <p>Among the 
          <hi rend="italic">Grasses</hi>of this Country I observe a large Species which grows in
          moist Situations; it rises to the hight of Eight or ten feet, the Culm is jointed,
          hollow, Smooth, as large as a goose quill, and more firm than ordinary grass; the leaf
          is linner broad and rough; it has much the appearance of the Meadin Cain as it is Called
          in the Southern parts of the U' States, and retains it's virdue untill late in the fall.
             this grass propegates principally by the Root which is horozontal and
          perennial.—.    a Second Species grows in tussucks and rises to the hight of
          Six or Eight feet; it Seams to delight in the Soil of the river bottoms which possess
          agreater mixture of Sand than the hills in this neighbourhood.    this is also
          a harsh Course grass; it appears to be the Same which is Called the Corn grass in the
          Southern States, and the Foxtail in 
          <name type="place" key="Virginia">Virginia</name>.    a third Species
          resembles the cheet, tho' the horses feed on it very freely.    a fouth and
          most prevalent Species is a grass which appears to be the Same Called the blue Grass
          common to maney parts of the United States; it is common to the bottoms as well as the
          uplands, is now Seeding and is from 9 inches to 2 feet high; it affords an excellent
          paterage for horses and appears to bear the frost and Snow better than any grass in our
          Country; I therefore regrete very much that the Seed will not be ripe before our
          probable departure.    this is a fine Soft grass and would no doubt make
          excellent hay if cultivated. I do not find the Green Sword here which we met with on the
          lower part of the 
          <name type="place" key="Columbia River">Columbia</name>. There are also Several Species
          of the wild Rye to be met with in the praries.    among the plants and Shrubs
          common to our Country I observe here the Seven bark, Wild rose, vineing honey suckle,
          Sweet willow, red willow, long leafed pine, Cattail or Coopers Flag. Lambs quarter,
          Strawberries, Raspberries, Goose berries, tongue grass, Mustard, tanzy, Sinquefield,
          horse mint, water penerial,
          <ref target="n35060518" n="18"/>elder, Coalts foot, Green Plantin, canser weed,

          of the day and rises Some at night as will be Seen by the remarks in the Diary of the

               <p>Thursday 5th June 1806.    a fair morning. Several of the party went across
          the river to Some villages and purchased Some uppah &amp; couse.—    towards
          evening our hunters
          <ref target="n35060519" n="19"/>all came in    had killed one black bear and
          five deer and informed us that an Indian had Set out Some days past to cross the
          mountains if possable but Soon after dark he returned to our Camp and informed us that
          he went over one mountain and in attempting to cross a creek which was high and rapid
          his horse fell and hurt him So he turned back to wait untill the water falls.
