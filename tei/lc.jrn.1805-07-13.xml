               <p>This morning being calm and Clear I had the remainder of our baggage embarked in the
          six small canoes and maned them with 
          <ref target="n16071301" n="1">two men each.</ref>I now bid a cheerfull adue to my camp
          and passed over to the opposite shore. 
          <name type="person" key="Lepage, Jean Baptiste">Baptiest La Page</name>one of the men
          whom I had reserved to man the canoes being sick I sent 
          <name type="person" key="Charbonneau, Toussaint">Charbono</name>in his stead by water
          and the sick man and 
          <name type="person" key="Sacagawea">Indian woman</name>accompanyed me by land.
             from the head of the 
          <name type="place" key="White Bear Islands">white bear Islands</name>I passed in a S. W.
          direction and struck the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>at 3 miles and continued up it to
          
          <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Capt. Clark's</name>camp where I arrived about
          9 A. M. and found them busily engaged with their canoes Meat &amp;c.    in my
          way I passed a very extraordinary Indian lodge, or at least the fraim of one; it was
          formed of sixteen large cottonwood poles each about fifty feet long and at their larger
          end which rested on the ground as thick as a man's body; these were arranged in a
          circular manner at bottom and equally distributed except the omission of one on the East
          side which I suppose was the entrance to the lodge; the upper part of the poles are
          united in a common point above and secured with large wyths of willow brush.
             in the center of this fabric there was the remains of a large fire; and
          about the place the marks of about 80 leather lodges. I know not what was the intention
          or design of such a lodge but certain I am that it was not designed for a dwelling of
          any one family.    it was 216 feet in circumpherence at the base.   
          it was most probably designed for some great feast, or a council house on some great
          national concern. I never saw a similar one nor do the nations lower down the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>construct such.
          <ref target="n16071302" n="2"/>The canoes and party with 
          <name type="person" key="Ordway, John">Sergt. Ordway</name>poceeded up the river about 5
          miles when the wind became so violent that two of the canoes shiped a considerable
          quanty of water and they were compelled to put too take out the baggage to dry and
          clense the canoes of the water.    about 5 P. M. the wi[n]d abated and they
          came on about 8 miles further and encamped. I saw a number of turtledoves and some
          pigeons today.    of the latter I shot one; they are the same common to the
          United States, or the wild pigeon as they are called.    nothing remarkable in
          the appearance of the country; the timber entirely confined to the river and the country
          back on either side as far as the eye can reach entirely destitute of trees or brush.
             the timber is larger and more abundant in the bottom in which we now are
          than I have seen it on the 
          <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri</name>for many hundred miles.
             the current of the river is still extreemly gentle. The hunters killed
          three buffaloe today which were in good order.    the flesh was brought in
          dryed the skins wer also streached for covering our baggage.    we eat an
          emensity of meat; it requires 4 deer, an Elk and a deer, or one buffaloe, to supply us
          plentifully 24 hours.    meat now forms our food prinsipally as we reserve our
          flour parched meal and corn as much as possible for the 
          <name type="place" key="Rocky Mountains">rocky mountains</name>which we are shortly to
          enter, and where from the indian account game is not very abundant. I preserved
          specemines of several small plants to day which I have never before seen. The Musquetoes
          and knats are more troublesome here if possible than they were at the 
          <name type="place" key="White Bear Islands">White bear Islands</name>. I sent a man to
          the canoes for my musquetoe bier which I had neglected to bring with me, as it is
          impossible to sleep a moment without being defended against the attacks of these most
          tormenting of all insects; the man returned with it a little after dark.—</p>
