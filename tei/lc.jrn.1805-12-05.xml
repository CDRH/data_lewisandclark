Some hard Showers of rain last night, this morning Cloudy and drisley at Some little distanc above the isthmus the rain is much harder.    high water to day at 12    this tide is 2 inches higher than that of yesterday.    all our Stores and bedding are again wet by the hard rain of last night. <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt. Lewis's</name> long delay below, has been the Sorce of no little uneasness on my part of his probable Situation and Safty, the repeeted rains and hard winds which blows from the S, W. renders it impossible for me to move with loaded Canoes along an unknown Coast    we are all wet &amp; disagreeable; the party much better of indispositions—.    <name type="person" key="Lewis, Meriwether">Capt.

There is more wet weather on this coast, than I ever knew in any other place; during a month, we have had three fair days; and there is no prospect of a change.
