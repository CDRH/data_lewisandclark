The following are a collection of miscellaneous documents by <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> that do not fit into other sections.

               <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark</name> made a list of his courses and distances up the <name type="place" key="Missouri River">Missouri River</name> in 1804 drawn from his daily log of journal entries. A check of this document against <name type="person" key="Clark, William">Clark's</name> journals shows no significant differences and only occasional errors in copying.
