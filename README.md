This is the repo for Lewis and Clark P5 docs, used for the Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition website (https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/).

All files used on the current website are in the tei folder. 

Some older TEI files, no longer used to populate the website directly, are in scripts/tei-unneeded and scripts/tei_data_ingest_helpers.
